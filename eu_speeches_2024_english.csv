President,"I wish you an excellent good morning on this last day of the parliamentary term. We start with the debate on the report by Daniel Freund, on behalf on the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the conclusion of an Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council, the European Commission, the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Central Bank, the European Court of Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee and the European Committee of the Regions, establishing an Interinstitutional Body for Ethical Standards for Members of Institutions and advisory bodies mentioned in Article 13 of the Treaty on European Union (N9-0008/2024 - C9-0127/2024 - 2024/2008(ACI)) (A9-0181/2024).",-,2024-04-25,2.

President,"Dear colleagues, today marks the 50th anniversary of the Carnation Revolution in Portugal – a moment in the timeline of European history that reverberates and inspires still. A date where democracy, freedom and dignity took back their rightful place in Portugal, and it serves as a reminder to us to never take these cornerstone European values for granted. So the symbolism of today is all the more significant as we meet for the last voting session of this 9th legislature of the European Parliament. Let me say very quickly how immensely proud I am of all the work that we have done, of all the laws that we have passed, of all the debates that we have had and of all the challenges that we have overcome together. I think we can look back at this mandate with satisfaction in knowing that we have played our part in writing the story of Europe. Before we go, I want to wish all of you who will not stand for elections well. Please know that there is a stone in this House that will always be yours. To all of you who are running again and will soon be campaigning, I wish you strength, patience and success. Please keep doing what you can to bring Europe closer to the people. This is the last voting session for many of you, including some of our committee chairs, group leaders and vice-presidents of Parliament. It is impossible to name each of the colleagues whom I would like to thank personally from here. But allow me to make one exception: Jerzy Buzek, our President, has decided not to run again. (Applause) President Buzek, I really want to use this opportunity to salute you and all you have done for this House and for all of us. Dziękuję. I also want to thank all the services and the staff of this great institution. Thank you for making everything that we do possible. Thank you for making us proud to serve this Parliament. (Applause) And finally, one more exception: today – after 33 years of service – marks the final plenary session for Steven Wicker, who has patiently, calmly and brilliantly dealt with the preparation and conduct of the voting sessions in plenary. Dear Steven, on behalf of myself and all the former Presidents and Vice-Presidents, and on behalf of all Members whom you served so loyally, I thank you. (Applause) We are not done yet. Our mandate continues until 16 July 2024. We will keep on working until the last minute. We will keep delivering and we will do everything in our power to return this House stronger, more effective, more independent and better able to be the voice of all Europeans for the 10th legislature. I will see you all in July, and now we vote. (Applause)",-,2024-04-25,6.

Virginijus Sinkevičius,"Mr President, honourable Members, dear rapporteur Mr Ehler, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the European Commission I am delighted to take part in this plenary debate on the Net Zero Industry Act. You are about to adopt a piece of legislation that is simply crucial. It’s going to spur the EU towards a decarbonised and resilient energy system, building on a competitive domestic supply of net-zero technologies. And we know this won’t be easy, as already witnessed with the [inaudible] taking place at international level in some of these key technologies. And I’m thinking of solar panels, wind turbines or batteries, for instance. So I would like to start by congratulating all of you, the European Parliament and in particular Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for having been able to negotiate and reach an agreement with the Council within such a short time frame. It shows how convinced we all are that the EU needs to remain a major producer of net-zero technologies. This is a prerequisite for reaping the benefits of the ongoing energy transition, for remaining competitive and for avoiding to replace a dependency on fossil fuels by a dependency on net-zero technologies. With this regulation we will help speed up clean industrial production in Europe in a way that no other EU instrument has done before. Take, for example, the benchmark that we set for our net-zero-technology manufacturing capacities: at least 40% of the Union’s annual deployment needs by 2030. The Parliament has played an important role in maintaining this very high ambition. The final text reflects this also, by requiring that the Union’s share for net-zero manufacturing is increased to reach 15% of world production by 2040. Another crucial element secured and improved by the Parliament is the annual 50-million-tonne CO2 storage target by 2030. It can now be supported through full CO2 value-chain projects for new industrial climate solutions for hard-to-abate emissions. With the Net Zero Industry Act we will have the first legal building block for the EU’s industrial carbon management strategy we recently adopted. Another important element concerns the scope of application. The Net Zero Industry Act, in its final form, will now focus on the entire supply chain, meaning that important industrial decarbonisation projects in energy-intensive sectors will also be eligible. Now we have to set this framework into motion and we have to do it fast. Let me reassure you that a quick and true implementation of the Net Zero Act remains a top priority for the Commission. Preparatory work is already ongoing across several work-streams, pending the entry into force of the regulation. Among the most immediate deliverables is the launch of the Net-Zero Europe platform. The platform is important to create a governance structure that oversees implementation. Member States, Commission and industry will work closely together with the Parliament as an observer to make sure that we are on course. As part of this governance structure, we will also set up an industry group to ensure continuous feedback from all net-zero sectors, as well as a net-zero regulatory burden scientific advisory group. We need to make sure that the work starts as soon as possible, and that we deliver on the promise to reduce administrative burden for all industrial activities in the framework of this Act. The Commission is also pleased with the Act’s focus on the strategic energy technology plan, which was important to the Parliament. We are already getting a full swing, making sure that the bridge between innovation and manufacturing is reinforced. We are also working on a system for granting strategic project status from July onwards. Net-zero projects will also be able to apply for this important status, and it will give them priority at national level, with faster permitting. We will give particular attention to these projects through the Net-Zero Europe platform also with regards to their financing. The Commission is also already preparing the implementation to the public procurement and renewable energy auctions provisions. In that sense, the chapter on access to markets is a fundamental step forward in our resilience-based and sustainable approach. We have no time to lose to start applying such provisions. In view of this, the Commission has also already started the necessary work on the related implementing and delegated acts. Some Member States have also already started applying this logic in national support schemes, which the Commission very much welcomes. With regard to the lack of skilled workers and acute bottleneck in the upscaling of our manufacturing capacities, the Commission is already preparing the launch of the first European net-zero industry academies. Finally, in order to carry the political momentum forward, the Commission decided to organise a high-level event dedicated to the Net-Zero Europe platform. It will take place ahead of the Compete Council on 23 May 2024.",-,2024-04-25,4.

Anna Deparnay-Grunenberg,"Mr President, I came to this House to be a voice for all the butterflies, the bees, the dragonflies that pollinate on food and fuel our imaginations. I came to this House to speak for the dolphins, the whales and the entire marine ecosystem. The sea not only provides us with food, but also deepens our sense of belonging. I came to this House to advocate for the trees and forest whose roots anchor us in the soil of existence. The branches reach towards the sky of possibilities, offering us air, water and life unconditionally. I’m neither naive nor romantic. I understand that our communities and social cohesion are built using these resources. We depend on fishing, forestry, farming, mining, industry and transportation for our goods, for our homes, for mobility, for energy, for communication. I am aware that the deep transformation of society and the great turning will not happen overnight. But I still held hope for the European Green Deal. With the Net Zero Industry Act, we had the opportunity to prioritise industries that could make us more resilient, more nature-compatible and more competitive in the long-run. Taking into account that the transport of goods and people is the most consuming in terms of energy, emissions and natural space, transport should have been considered in this act. However, I see no investment or prioritising in enhancing the competitiveness of railway systems, despite our train manufacturers being real big champions. Accelerating environmental assessment for the deployment of wind and solar energy is obvious. Unfortunately, we sometimes have to destroy a small piece of nature somewhere to combat climate change, which threatens our planetary ecosystem. However, now that I see carbon capture pipelines and nuclear power plants also prioritised for rapid development, I cannot support this act anymore. I came to this House to be a voice for the dragonflies, for the dolphins and the trees, and here or wherever else, I will not lower my voice.",Greens/EFA,2024-04-25,4.

Damian Boeselager,"Mr President, diverging to our German colleague from the FDP, Volt does believe that we need to have a climate neutral economy. But we also believe that we need to unleash the full potential of our entrepreneurs. And here it also needs to be said that the state government cannot foresee what kind of innovation will actually work, but that the state should set the framework for our innovation to thrive. So that means when you look at innovation, new ideas, we need to invest more in Horizon in our education systems. We need to triple the budget of Horizon to actually unleash new ideas. We also need to be more optimistic about the future. Entrepreneurs are only going to invest their time and energy into new businesses if there’s optimism. They need funds. And yes, that is public funds to guarantee, for example, large Capex investments . But we also need to unleash the institutional investors. 5% of institutional investors should go into new businesses. We also need talent. If you want talent, you also need to look at upskilling and attracting international talent. So we need to unleash the full potential of the European labour market to actually attract talent. We need to harmonise our rules across Europe. It’s much too complicated that you have, you know, compliance in one Member State, but you can’t actually then, you know, scale to the next Member State easily. That needs to be much easier. And if you do all of these things, and if we also implement competition law and State-aid rules so that we invest on the European level together and not nationally, only, then we will be successful.",Greens/EFA,2024-04-25,4.

Barry Andrews,"Mr President, Commissioner and colleagues, as this is my last contribution in this mandate at least, I want to thank all of my colleagues that worked with me on the Sustainable Development Goals Alliance, and it is fitting that my last contribution should be on a law that seeks to chart a path for sustainable development and a Green Deal that works for people and planet. I see the green transition as a unique opportunity to create high-quality jobs in sectors that are very important to Europe, to Dublin and to Ireland. The Net Zero Industry Act is a remarkable piece of legislation that will incentivise public and private investment in wind, solar batteries and in storage. A very welcome shot in the arm for European industry. Dublin is already the tech capital of the European Union, with 16 out of the top 20 digital companies around the world based there. There’s no reason why Ireland shouldn’t be leading in the production of cutting-edge technology and wind, in heat pumps and in carbon capture, with huge competition from the US and China and elsewhere. Net zero will be key to Ireland and the European Union’s future.

Virginijus Sinkevičius,"Madam President, honourable Members, for all of us, upholding integrity and independence within all European institutions is crucial for maintaining public trust and impartial decision-making. Based on extensive work and contacts with the other institutions, the Commission tabled in June 2023 a proposal for a joint agreement between the institutions to establish an interinstitutional ethics body. To be truly interinstitutional, this body is common and open to all institutions and both advisory bodies mentioned in Article 13 of the Treaty on European Union. The Commission believes that the interinstitutional body will ensure that we have a clear and high standards of integrity and independence for the members of all European institutions, that we all have appropriate compliance mechanisms in all institutions, and that differences between the institutions and the institutional balance established by the founding treaties is respected. Areas where these standards are needed referred to such things like declarations of interest, acceptance of gifts, hospitality or travel offered by third parties, meetings with the interest representatives and their publication or post mandate activities of former members. The negotiating parties have conducted 13 technical meetings and six political meetings, culminating in the provisional agreement presented to you today for endorsement through the vote in the plenary. The Commission approved the agreement during its college meeting on 17 April, and we hope that all other parties to the agreement will finalise their procedures in time for the agreement to enter into force before the European elections in June. While I deeply regret that the European Council is not a party to the agreement at the moment, I am optimistic about their future involvement. The doors remain open and I am confident that the benefits demonstrated by the agreement will encourage the European Council to reconsider its position in the nearest future. Today, Parliament has to decide if it approves the agreement.

Colleagues, this draft on the so-called interinstitutional agreement has so many legal uncertainties, which need to be clarified before we vote. There is no legal basis.

And there is one final thing I could not get my head around, colleagues: the secretariat – the powerhouse of this body – shall be hosted in the Commission. We, Parliament, are supposed to control the Commission. In future, the Commission will control us on moral standards. So I ask you: if you don’t follow me, postpone.

Virginijus Sinkevičius,"Madam President, honourable Members, I want to thank you for having added a debate on the Commission’s communication on pre-enlargement reforms and policy reviews. This represents our contribution to the ongoing discussions that should lead to the endorsement by EU leaders of a roadmap for future work on enlargement and reforms by the summer. This is also the first stepping stone towards the reforms necessary to make the EU ready for a larger Union, with a series of in-depth policy reviews to begin in early 2025. Enlargement is in the Union’s own strategic interest. While there are challenges, the benefits of a well-managed enlargement process span across a number of areas: geopolitical, economic, environmental, social and democratic. For these benefits to materialise, both the EU and aspiring Member States must be well prepared, and this requires full and sustained political commitment and engagement – first and foremost from the enlargement countries, but also from the EU itself. With this understanding, the Commission’s communication looks at the implications of a larger EU in four main areas: values, policies, budget and governance, laying the ground for the pre-enlargement policy reviews. The EU must deepen as it widens. We must start preparing today for the Union of tomorrow and use enlargement as a catalyst for progress. While reforms were already necessary, with enlargement they become indispensable – and it is true that there will be challenging discussions ahead, reconciling the opportunities of a larger Union with the challenges it possesses will not be easy. It will require us to be bold in shaping the Europe of the future. But we are not starting from scratch. This is a key message from our communication. First, we have drawn important lessons from previous enlargements. We have redefined our enlargement toolbox, including through our policy of gradual integration. By frontloading certain benefits and obligations of EU membership, enlargement countries can be better prepared for a smoother accession process. Second, let us not forget that enlargement is only one factor determining the future of the EU and its capacity to act. In the last years, the EU has successfully dealt with the COVID pandemic, agreed on Next Generation EU, shown unprecedented unity in the face of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, and effectively addressed the energy crisis. As we improve our policies at 27, we also become better prepared for a larger Union. Third, we must make full use of the untapped possibilities already offered by the Treaties, so the Commission is ready to support those who want to reform the Treaty to make it work better for citizens. And these are the main messages we want to pass through this communication. More will come when we present our in-depth policy reviews.",-,2024-04-25,3.

Mick Wallace,"Madam President, when we talk about EU enlargement, including Ukrainian accession, the people of Europe and especially Ireland should be aware of exactly what it will mean. The cost of Ukrainian accession will be monumental. It will cost trillions to rebuild Ukraine, not the EUR 50 billion. That’s before we talk about the actual cost of enlargement. Ukraine and Moldova are three times poorer than Bulgaria, which is the EU’s current most disadvantaged Member State. CAP will not exist as we now know it. The European Council estimates a 20 % cut in CAP payments to existing Member States will be needed to allow for Ukrainian accession. In this communication on pre-enlargement reforms and policy reviews last month, the Commission again stated that further enlargement of the EU would require the end of unanimity voting. The Commission specifically said that qualified majority voting should be extended to taxation and foreign policy. This will have a profound impact on Ireland. It would put Ireland at the mercy of other larger Member States and their hawkish foreign policy. It will be the death of Irish neutrality. We need to think about where we’re going.

Sven Simon,"Madam President, colleagues, this last day of our mandate is such a sad day for parliamentarism that I lost my voice. I was shocked how badly this interinstitutional agreement was negotiated. It is a retrial of parliamentarism. It is a frontal attack against the independence of freely elected Members of Parliament, and you know that. In your case, it is intentionally. This draft needs to be renegotiated. First of all, there is no legal basis. First, you started with Article 295, then the Legal Service argued tradition, custom. Now you write in the resolution Article 232 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. If that would be the legal basis, then we would need a majority of the component Members. It is a blatant violation of the principle of separation of powers. The Council will set moral standards, not legal rules. You talked about legal rules; we are talking about ethics, moral standards. It’s not only the European Council, it’s the Council which sets the rules; it’s not bound by it. The secretariat will be hosted in the Commission – unbelievable! We, the Parliament, are supposed to control the Commission. Now they will control us. We would agree to a standard-setting commission, but we cannot agree to a body that is supposed to discipline freely elected representatives based on moral ideas.",PPE,2024-04-25,2.

Miapetra Kumpula-Natri,"Madam President, colleagues, I have observed every case of misconduct with concern, and it is crucial to address these issues and build confidence in the EU’s integrity. Today can mark a stride toward a more ethical, transparent and accountable European Union. It is up to us to make the decision, and it’s up to the work of the next Parliament to improve it, because there have been better ideas, for example, from my Group, S&D. This timing of this discussion on the last day of this Parliament underscores our dedication to transparency and accountability as we enter the period of European elections. Ensuring citizens’ trust in our democratic institutions remains steadfast. As we move forward, let me remind you that this is not perfect, but voting against an ethical standards body looks very bad. We have to say clear that we do not accept third-party, third-country involvement here. So, Mr President, in my 10 last seconds as an MEP on the speaking podium after my 10 years, I have not given up hope for democracy, I will not give up hope for European integration, and I think we stand for democracy here, but we also stand for Ukraine. Let us keep that moment for the next Parliament, too.

What a shame that governments have chosen to stay out from having an independent interinstitutional ethics body. European governments, together with the EPP and the fascists in this House, are giving the signal that they do not want transparency for our institutions. I am very satisfied that even in my last speech in this House, under this mandate, I am fighting corruption, bribery, and I am fighting for the transparency and the enforcement of all ethical standards in this European Union. We need these to be higher. We need to fight for what is good, and we need to fight for this House, for the European institutions, to regain their credibility after a number of embarrassing and problematic issues that have cropped up.

Virginijus Sinkevičius,"Madam President, dear Members of the Parliament, thank you very much. This debate has shown the importance of the issue, and has shown how seriously this House takes its own mandate and the issue of the ethical conduct of Members representing European citizens. I have attentively listened to those advocating for and those opposing the establishment of the interinstitutional ethics body. I want to clarify that no institution can be outvoted. No institution can be forced to do anything that it does not want. It is a common body which fully respects the autonomy and independence of each institution and its members. And it is also a departure point: we are now starting at eight institutions and bodies, but I count on the European Council joining soon in the next mandate, and the scope and functioning of the body may also evolve with time. Also, the European Investment Bank has expressed interest in joining. The EU ethics body will play a pivotal role in collectively upholding the high standards expected by European citizens and ourselves.

Heidi Hautala,"Madam President, we really have to thank Daniel Freund for his persistent efforts to get this interinstitutional agreement in place. I believe that the fact that the independent experts will judge the standards and the cases is really important. Can I remind you that when we revised the Advisory Committee in the Code of Conduct for Members of the European Parliament, there was a proposal to add three independent experts to the five MEPs. But those groups who obviously are against this interinstitutional agreement today also opposed putting in place the independent experts. And I believe that, for the European Parliament, it will be very important that there is a kind of second step, because obviously it does not foresee that we will give up our own advisory body, but there will be a body that will be guiding and giving maybe precedents in tricky situations. Lastly, I want to say that something that remains to be solved is undue foreign influence. We need cooperation with national law enforcement agencies and intelligence services. We are, at the moment, in a very difficult situation, because we can’t get that information to judge if there has been misconduct or corruption.",Greens/EFA,2024-04-25,2.

Guy Verhofstadt,"Madam President, I think that this communication, Commissioner, is a typical example of what I call ‘ostrich politics’, you know, the ostrich putting his head in the sand and thinking that the problem will disappear. It’s a typical example of such ostrich politics. Why? Because we know that we will do the enlargement to 35-36 Member States, but we are not ready as a European Union to receive these 35-36 countries in total. And what you do in this communication is saying, oh, the problems , we are going to solve them inside the European Union because we have the passerelle clause, which we didn’t apply for 20 years, and we have the enhanced cooperation as the way to solve the problems. Which is a devastating thing because we have already Schengen, we have already the Euro, we have already the patent, we have already the fiscal compact, we have already the arrest warrant. And we will add additional enhanced cooperation. That is what the communication is saying, that these are the two tools to solve the problems in a Union of 35-36 Member States. Well, I have to tell you, I find this irresponsible and insane. And moreover, it’s the first time, in my opinion, that I have seen that the Commission is renouncing its historical role to be at the side of the European Parliament, to bring forward the reform treaties that are absolutely necessary to make this union ready for 36 Member States. Why is there nothing about Treaty change in your communication? I will tell you why there is nothing, because Ms von der Leyen does not want that there is something on Treaty change. She need to be re-elected, presented by the Member States, by the Council so that you cannot. So I tell you one thing. I tell you one thing. In any case, my group will not vote in the next Parliament for a candidate for President of the European Commission and for a Commission that is not putting Treaty change as an essential condition for the enlargement of the European Union. That is clear. It’s very clear. And it’s a shame, I tell you that, that we asked the Commissioners to change that communication and to be aware of the need to change the Treaty. How will you do it? A Commission with 36 Members? You are already now with 27, have not enough competences to fulfil the different portfolios. Will you do it like that? Continue with unanimity? Continue with the budget with 1 %? The geopolitical Commission with the budget of 1 % of European GDP. It’s ridiculous to talk about the geopolitics. I find it insane that the Commission comes forward with a crucial communication on the future of the European Union, including preparing the enlargement to 36 Member States, and then says nothing, but, oh, we have the passerelle clause to solve our problems, something that has not been applied and cannot be applied in the Union because it needs a unanimous decision. So I tell you, and I repeat myself for the last time, this is my last intervention. So I will not bother you anymore in the coming years. Not inside the Parliament, but more, maybe outside the Parliament. Be sure of that.

Billy Kelleher,"Madam President, while Treaty change may be required in the event of extra enlargement, I believe at this stage what we should do is prepare citizens, both within the European Union and in the candidate countries, to ensure that we can have a seamless merging of candidate countries. There is no doubt that there are concerns that some countries would not be able to live with the pace of the European economy, but I would like to remind people that Ireland, in 1973 when it joined, was the poorest country in Europe, and at that stage even some European countries opposed our application to join the EU. So I do believe that it is in the interests of the candidate countries as well, but we must ensure that we invest in them now, in terms of institutions, democracy, a functioning market economy and ensuring that they can live with the EU obligations. If we don’t invest in them now, well then we will have significant challenges in convincing citizens within the European Union now that others are welcome into our Union. So I certainly support the concept of enlargement, investment in the candidate countries now, to ensure that they will have the capacity to live within the European Union, and as importantly, European citizens will then be able to embrace them and welcome them.",Renew,2024-04-25,3.

Domènec Ruiz Devesa,"Madam President, allow me to take the floor today of course as an MEP, but I will speak also in my capacity as President of the Union of European Federalists in order to tackle this topic. Thank you to Commissioner Sinkevičius, particularly because you lately are filling in for every other Commissioners, which of course we thank you, but I think it’s a very bad sign that, I mean, debate after debate, the responsible Commissioners are not showing up, like yesterday on the right of inquiry debate we had McGuinness and not Šefčovič. As it has been said I have to say that your communication – that you defended very ably because probably you got the speaking points – is a shame, is totally disappointing, is unacceptable from the part of Parliament. You allowed yourself in this communication to refer to our proposal, which is the official proposal to reform the Treaties in Article 48, as a ‘reflection’ at the same level as think-tanks’ opinions on the matter. How can you allow this lack of respect to be in a Commission document? Secondly, we were thinking, right, some of us, OK, maybe the Commission will try to avoid referring to the ordinary procedure to review the Treaties and will refer to the simplified procedure, or will refer to the accession treaties as a mechanism to do the necessary adjustments. Not even that! Not even that! You only refer to the passerelles – never activated, not even once since 2009. And then you refer to enhanced cooperations. So do you really think we want to build Europe not as an exception, but as a default by the club of Schengen, the club of the euro, the club of home affairs, the club of defence union? Do you do you think this is sensible? I mean, you are defending here an untenable position and you have to reflect, because otherwise what I will also recommend, as has been said, I will recommend to my political family, the Socialists and Democrats, not to give the confidence to the next Commission if they don’t back the Parliament proposal to reform the Treaties. And by the way, you have to take a position, because Article 48 says that once the European Council considers our proposals, you are to be consulted and you have to give an opinion.

Andrius Kubilius,"Madam President, today we have two major issues with enlargement: how to make the enlargement process a success and how to keep the European Union alive after enlargement. The first priority now is the question of how to bring the whole negotiations and enlargement process back on a ‘Central European track’ with negotiations for 3 or 4 years, and to move away from the experience of the Western Balkans negotiations trap. In order to move away from such a trap, first of all we need to understand that enlargement will be very important not only for Ukraine, Moldova and the Western Balkans, but also for the European Union itself. Enlargement to those countries will make the European Union stronger from an economic point of view, safer from a security point of view and more powerful geopolitically, since such an enlargement will allow the European Union to assist positive transformations in the broader region of Belarus and Russia. In order to achieve such a goal, first of all the countries of Central Europe celebrating the 20th anniversary of their own membership will need to avoid becoming real obstacles to the next wave of enlargement. They will need to overcome historical disagreements with their neighbours. They will need to be not afraid of economic competition and not afraid of transformation to real democracy in EU decision-making with QMV. In order to achieve such a strategic goal of enlargement during this decade, we will need to have a powerful commissioner for enlargement and specialised committee on enlargement in this House during the next mandate.

Thank you, Guy. You will remain for me a great example of a European-level statesman. Deepening and widening of the European Union integration are two important and interrelated aspects of the Union’s development. A reformed and well-functioning European Union responding to the expectations and reforms of its new members is a stronger European Union, better able to cope with global competition while building comprehensive security. The EU’s openness to enlargement, a clear enlargement strategy and fulfilment of commitments by new members are essential conditions for achieving the goals of our united Union. It is necessary to take into account the time frame, which is a very much mobilising element. The next European Parliament will have to devote more time for these issues.

Tineke Strik,"Madam President, dear Commissioner, the Russian invasion in Ukraine was a reality check. It made us realise that enlargement is not only vital for the citizens of the candidate countries, but also for the EU to preserve our values and to strengthen our role in the world. But enlargement and being an effective organisation and preserving a veto is not a realistic combination. We must urgently make our House ready for more inhabitants, but also to gain more decisiveness and to prevent blackmail by a single non-compliant Member State. Orbán and Fico show us how vetoes can easily undermine the values and strength that we hold so dear. And this is also why the rule-of-law conditionality must become more effective, both in the current Member States and the candidate Member States. But let us also pave the way to our House. Abolish the veto and enlargement process, support them better, and already involve candidate countries in common policies such as the single market, energy policies and other policy areas. Let them not wait for tangible benefits of accession, which would encourage the EU trust of their citizens. Political declarations and nice words only do not bring that trust, do not push reforms in candidate countries, and don’t make our Union ready for a larger and more meaningful future.

Nicolas Schmit,"Mr President, honourable Members, well, first I want to start with thanking again all those who have contributed to what has been achieved. I really was very happy to work with you and it was always very encouraging. And I think we have made progress, but having made progress means also that further progress has to be made. So, I know that the declaration is, by itself, not yet an achievement. We have now to develop and that has to happen now. The political will, as it has existed during this mandate and during this legislature, we have to develop the political will to put the declaration and the different objectives into concrete policies. That’s what we have to do. And I think that the fact that we have the La Hulpe Declaration, that the Belgian Presidency managed, and it was not so easy we have to say it, to manage to have such a declaration and to describe or to open this kind of roadmap for strengthening further social Europe is an achievement, which we have now during the next mandate to give a concrete direction, a concrete content. And there are many issues you have mentioned a lot, and I also regret that this declaration could not be signed, was not signed by an important so-called social partner. I really regret that. And they have really to reflect about their own role in building Europe, not just social Europe, but Europe, and social is part of Europe. I also regret that two Member States just did not sign. This is also some kind of a regrettable but also negative attitude. But well, that was their decision. But now we have this declaration and I think we can build on it. Now I have to say it, I am really shocked by those who attack Europe, attacked social Europe and, by the way, out themselves as the friends of Putin. They are not the friends of European citizens. They are not the friends of working people who need a strong social Europe. They are the enemies of working people, as they have shown in many of their votes, because they always voted against social progress which was achieved in this House. And this has to be said and this has to be known outside. Now, on the few remarks on the declaration, I think many issues have to be treated. Yes, housing is a big issue everywhere, and that’s why Europe has to become more active on the housing policy and support the idea of affordability and accessibility of houses all over Europe for people, for youngsters, as it has been said. Yes, we have to make clear that the future governance in Europe does not leave social aside. And again, this is a question of politics, of political will. And we have to make sure that what has been decided, nevertheless, the social component in the future governance has not, should not and will not be abandoned or neglected. My last word, I would like to insist on public procurement. I was very positively surprised by the fact that four groups in this Parliament, with all the differences, managed to adopt a clear declaration, and alliance even, to say public procurement is so important, there’s so much money going through that we really have to review and strengthen public procurement with a stronger social dimension. Well, I can only congratulate those four groups who have done that. And I just also to finish want to mention that here, perhaps the wording of the La Hulpe Declaration is quite cautious, but there is a wording on an eventual evaluation and also further steps are there. And we know when the wording is there and the political will comes, it’s possible to make change real.",-,2024-04-24,17.

Mathieu Michel,"Monsieur le Président, Mesdames et Messieurs les parlementaires, chers membres de la Commission, la politique de cohésion a soutenu chaque étape de l’intégration européenne en tant qu’expression la plus visible de la solidarité de l’Union européenne et des États membres européens les uns envers les autres, en veillant à ce que tous puissent bénéficier ensemble du projet européen. En investissant dans les infrastructures, l’innovation, l’éducation et d’autres domaines clés, la politique de cohésion a aidé directement les régions moins développées et toutes les autres régions à tirer profit des avantages et des chances qu’offre le marché unique. Le neuvième rapport sur la cohésion, récemment publié par la Commission, ainsi que le rapport sur l’avenir du marché unique, rédigé par Enrico Letta, ont replacé la politique de cohésion au centre du débat politique de l’Union européenne, en rappelant l’importance historique et structurelle du tandem entre politique de cohésion et marché unique dans le projet européen. Nous vivons une période sans précédent dans l’histoire de l’Union. À la double transition écologique et numérique, sur laquelle l’Union a beaucoup investi pendant ce dernier mandat, il faut maintenant ajouter aussi le défi démographique et l’impact qu’il aura sur la vie des citoyens et sur l’économie. Twenty years after the biggest enlargement the EU has ever seen, we must now analyse all EU policies – including cohesion policy– and how they are financed. We need to ensure that EU policies are fit for the future and inform discussions on possible adjustments to the EU budget prior to the adoption of the next multiannual financial framework 2028-2034. Cohesion policy must remain a pillar of the EU, with the aim of ensuring economic, social and territorial convergence within the EU, and reducing disparities between its constituent regions. At the same time, it must evolve to adapt to new challenges and prepare for enlargement. Mr President, honourable Members, dear Member of the Commission, allow me also to say a few words about competitiveness now that the Letta report has opened the way to a new reflection on the future of our single market and on Europe’s world in a global economy. Faced with a new geopolitical reality and increasingly complex challenges, the EU is determined to act decisively to ensure its competitiveness, prosperity and long-term leadership role on the world stage. Our leaders confirmed this again last week at the highest political level in the conclusions adopted by the European Council on 18 April 2024. The Letta report will also be discussed at the Competitiveness Council on 23 May 2024. A new European agreement on competitiveness is needed. It will require efforts at both Union and Member State level in all policy areas to close the gaps in growth, productivity and innovation between the Union and its international partners on the one hand, and its main competitors on the other hand. This requires the implementation of an effective industrial policy that competitively decarbonises our industry, develops the Union’s competitive edge in digital and clean technologies, and diversifies and secures strategic supply chains. As we called in the report, an adapted cohesion policy will have an important role to play in ensuring that all regions participate in, and benefit from, growth and thus from our common competitiveness.",-,2024-04-24,"18.

Mairead McGuinness,"Mr President, colleagues, dear Secretary of State Michel, you have certainly been working overtime today, taking so many debates. Thank you for your contribution to this and other debates this afternoon. The 9th Cohesion Report, published earlier this month, really does paint a very positive and rich picture of economic, social and territorial cohesion across the European Union. There is remarkable convergence over recent years. The countries that joined the EU in 2004 – as we celebrated earlier today – have seen their GDP per head increase from 52% of the EU average to nearly 80% as of last year. This is, in large part, thanks to EU cohesion policy. Evaluation of the 2014-2020 programme shows that, by 2022, the policy had supported 4.4 million businesses, created 370 000 new jobs, protected 17 million people from floods and improved health services for 63 million people. The benefits extend beyond direct investments. Enrico Letta’s new report, ‘Much more than a market’, shows how cohesion policy has always been a key success factor for the single market. For every EUR 1 invested in cohesion policy, EU GDP increases by nearly EUR 3 in the long term. Cohesion policy is one of the key pillars of the European project, accompanying each step of the integration process – from the creation of the single market to successive enlargements, supporting the achievement of the European Union’s priorities. Market forces alone cannot ensure that the benefits from these key integration steps are evenly spread across Europe, and that’s why cohesion policy is vital – so that every Member State and region can contribute, benefit and reach its full potential. Cohesion policy also acted as a key stabiliser in recent crises. After the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy rebounded much more quickly than in the financial crisis thanks to the European response, where cohesion was a core part. Cohesion helped in welcoming refugees fleeing Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and in protecting the most vulnerable from subsequent energy price hikes. These and many other benefits are known to Parliament, and were well reflected in your opinions and reports during this legislative term. They are also reflected in discussions over the past year on the future of cohesion policy. But, of course, in the 9th Cohesion Report and stakeholder discussions, there are also revelations around new challenges that the future policy will need to address. First, convergence at national level is not always reflected at regional level. Urban centres thrive while other regions decline. Rural, mountainous, island and sparsely populated regions face particular challenges, and some regions have fallen into development traps. Regions facing persistent stagnation struggle to get back on a growth path, risking the creation of a geography of political discontent. Second, Europe is facing particular social and demographic challenges. Regions where opportunities are scarce experience brain drain, which exacerbates long-term trends, like an ageing population and challenges in providing public services. And third are the impacts of climate. Some regions are particularly exposed – not just those at risk from fires, floods and droughts, but also those most dependent on carbon-intensive activities. It is essential that cohesion policy evolves to face these challenges and other challenges that may emerge, including in the context of future enlargement. The debate on the future of cohesion policy has started – with Parliament, with Member States, with regions and local stakeholders, with citizens. Together, we should build on the success of Europe’s convergence story and learn lessons from our collective experience to continue modernising and strengthening cohesion policy. So I look forward to your insights during tonight’s debate.",-,2024-04-24,"18.

Mairead McGuinness,"Mr President, dear colleagues, the debate now has underlined the crucial role of cohesion policy, both to address today’s priorities and tomorrow’s challenges. While it is for the next Commission to propose a new legislative framework, reflections must start in good time – and they already have. This is vital because we see already certain trends emerging and impacting on Europe’s regions: issues around skills, demographic change, climate change, the green and digital transitions, a changing geopolitical context. All of these trends are already impacting at the regional level and must be addressed to ensure sustained convergence. Because every region is different and has a different development profile, the approach must be tailored. Balanced development means a continued focus on less-developed regions, while not ignoring emerging challenges in other regions, especially those at risk of development traps and brain drain, or those undergoing industrial transition. So this requires a cohesion policy that retains the key principles that have worked in the past, especially partnership and multi-level governance, and strong support for administrative capacity-building as a necessary condition for effective cohesion programming results, while developing and deepening in the following areas: performance-based mechanisms; reforms overcoming obstacles to growth specific to each region; better coordination with other policies; further simplification and the flexibility to react to unforeseen crisis and developing needs while maintaining a stable framework. A question was raised earlier by a colleague who said ‘who decides, the regions or Brussels?’ This isn’t an either or. I mean, the regions know their problems and Brussels can help with the solutions – and I’m sure my colleague, Commissioner Ferreira, would endorse that. So I want to close by saying that European cohesion policy has already proved its worth for long-term convergence to short-term crisis. We have been successful in bringing Europeans together. Now, as we move forward, let’s remember this goal: whatever we face in the coming years, no European should be left behind and no place should feel forgotten. For this, we need a strong cohesion policy with a solid budget. Thank you for your support.",-,2024-04-24,"18.

Mathieu Michel,"Mr President, honourable Members of Parliament, dear member of the Commission, thank you for your interventions. I can only endorse your calls for stronger cohesion policy in the future, in line with the objectives of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to reduce disparities in levels of development between regions and to strengthen economic, social and territorial cohesion. For this reason, particular attention must be paid to those regions which are experiencing difficulties in adapting to the dual transition to green and digital technologies. The Belgian Presidency would like to thank the European Parliament for putting this issue on the agenda, and for its central role in the debate surrounding the revision of cohesion policy. We take good note of the suggestions included in the report adopted at the last plenary session on this subject. It is important to keep this discussion at the top of our agendas, ahead of the preparation of the new cycle of the Multiannual Financial Framework from 2028. Mr President, honourable Members, dear member of the Commission, we are now only a few weeks away from the next elections to the European Parliament. These elections offer us an ideal opportunity to discuss the policies that will best contribute to building a more competitive Europe, a more cohesive Europe, a stronger Europe, in an uncertain world. On behalf of the Belgian Presidency, let me therefore take this opportunity to warmly thank the Parliament, its members, services and staff for the good cooperation of the past few months. Together we were able to maximise our legislative work in just three months, with 104 trilogues and interinstitutional political meetings held, and agreements reached on 67 important dossiers – many of which are voted this week. Meanwhile, we are looking ahead and will be shifting our focus to the next institutional cycle. We will help prepare the new Strategic Agenda 2024-2029, in collaboration with the President of the European Council. We will continue to engage Member States and Institutions in further reflections on the future of Europe. Importantly, we will make every effort to protect the integrity of the European elections, including by using the relevant tools available, such as the Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference tools. Dear Members of Parliament, I sincerely believe that we have delivered for the people of Europe over the past five years. We have done so in difficult circumstances. Even if the future looks challenging, we can steer a course together. Thank you once again for your attention.",-,2024-04-24,"18.

Virginijus Sinkevičius,"Mr President, honourable Members, the values set out in the EU treaties are neither theoretical nor optional. They are the essential condition upon which our democratic and pluralist societies are founded. The EU was built on the ashes of World War Two, and it was designed also to counter totalitarian tendencies. According to Hannah Arendt, the features of a totalitarian regime include a government characterised by a single-party dictatorship that seeks total control over every aspect of society and the individual, including politics, economy, culture, education and even thought. She highlighted the use of terror, propaganda, mass surveillance and ideological indoctrination as key mechanisms through which totalitarian regimes maintain power and suppress dissent. The EU and its Member States are strong democracies with laws and freedoms, but democracy needs nurturing. The enemies of democracy try to undermine it, weaken it, or even destroy it, and they use a variety of methods, traditional and modern, including foreign interference, disinformation, corruption, or hybrid threats. The Commission has worked with the European Parliament and the Council to develop a set of legal instruments and policy initiatives to promote and protect the EU common values and fundamental rights. The Russian war against Ukraine and the Middle East crisis remind us that peace cannot be taken for granted. It reminds us of the evils that result from politics built on aggressive, expansionist extremism and ideologies of intolerance and hatred. When our values are placed in doubt, fear becomes the driving motive. We should not respond to this fear by lecturing citizens or ignoring their concerns. We have to try to understand the reasons, address challenges and propose better alternatives. Countries like Russia have increasingly sought to undermine our democracies and promote fear. But we are not defenceless. On the contrary, the European Democracy Action Plan set out a comprehensive list of concrete measures to harden our democracies to these attacks and challenges. The Commission put forward initiatives that range from regulation on political advertising to measures to protect journalists and prevent strategic lawsuits against public participation. Our new digital and media regulation, including the Digital Services Act and the European Media Freedom Act, aim to support a resilient and diverse media landscape that strengthens our democratic space and public trust. I would like to thank this House for your support for these files. Supporting the work of the civil society organisations and independent experts is essential to democracy and for remembrance of our totalitarian past. Civil society deserves the role it gained in the Anti Disinformation Code, along with the online platforms and other digital companies. In December 2023, the Commission presented the Defence of Democracy package. It includes a directive for transparency standards for interest representation activities on behalf of third countries that will shed more light against hidden foreign interference, and a recommendation on inclusive and resilient elections. In the joint communication on ‘No place for hate: a Europe united against hatred’, the Commission reiterated our commitment to step up EU efforts to fight hatred in all its forms, and this includes remembrance of our totalitarian and authoritarian past and its victims. The core EU framework for a strong common response to racist and xenophobic hate speech and hate crime is the 2008 Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia. Under this, Member States are obliged to penalise public incitement to violence or hatred. Knowledge of the crimes committed by totalitarian regimes is also key to a healthy debate based on facts. That is why every year we mark 23 August, our Europe-wide day of remembrance for the victims of all totalitarian and authoritarian regimes. To support awareness and debate, the Commission has introduced European Citizens’ Panels on tackling hatred in society. We also have a programme which supports remembrance actions on the causes of totalitarian regimes, in particular Nazism, but also fascism, Stalinism and totalitarian communist regimes. Young people should also become aware of their common history and values as the foundation for a common future. Through Erasmus+ and the European Solidarity Corps, we promote activities aiming at promoting European values and combating all forms of discrimination and intolerance. European heritage dates can also raise awareness on totalitarian regimes. The Commission is co-financing these open calls with the Council of Europe and providing grants to inspiring projects promoting historic literacy.

Rule of law is not a noun, but a verb. It requires constant vigilance to protect the precious foundations our community of values is built on.

The social market economy has failed them. Again and again, the market is prioritised at the expense of the social. Paragraph 36 of the Declaration deals specifically with housing. With every month that currently passes, Ireland reaches another record high of homelessness. The latest numbers of people accessing emergency accommodation in Ireland is 13 841. That includes more than 4 000 children. Between 2010 and the fourth quarter of 2023, rents in Ireland increased by 102 %, according to Eurostat.

That won’t be lost on people, because you can make all the declarations you like, but when everybody knows that the deal has been done and that we’re in for another round of savage austerity for Europe, another round of structural reforms, everybody knows that means more poverty, more inequality, more precarity and another massive transfer of wealth upwards. Austerity left the eurozone as an economic shadow of its former self. The US economy has grown to twice the size of the eurozone over the past 15 years. The once mighty European manufacturing sector now limps along behind America and China. And you want to do it all over again? People have nothing left to give.

And the fiscal rules adopted this week threaten essential social investments such as childcare, health or public transport. We have to tackle the root causes of inequality by taxing the rich, pollution and over profits. Stop tax evasion.

Nicolas Schmit,"Mr President, honourable Members, Monsieur le Représentant de la Présidence, it is my pleasure to address you in plenary one final time before the EU elections, and to do so on the topic of the future of social Europe. So much has been achieved since the landmark Porto Social Summit almost three years ago, where we jointly set out a long-term vision for a strong social Europe. There is a lot to be proud of collectively. Inspired by the vision of Jacques Delors, we have concentrated on embedding the social into the economic, into the industrial, into the digital, into the green. This Commission has taken action on each of the 20 principles of the Pillar of Social Rights, breathing life into it. We have committed to new targets on employment, skills and poverty reduction by 2030. In view of strengthening upward social convergence, cohesion and competitiveness, we have delivered breakthrough employment legislation ensuring adequate minimum wages and extension of collective agreements, protecting platform workers and guaranteeing higher standards of health and safety at work. We have put the spotlight on skills and training, including in this Year of Skills. This is helping to make the transition more inclusive and to make the opportunities accessible to all workers by tackling the labour and skills shortages faced by so many sectors. We have addressed long-standing inequalities and boosted social protection and social inclusion from the European Child Guarantee to long-term care systems, from adequate minimum income to tackling homelessness. But the achievement I am most proud of is the fact that this Commission has mainstreamed the social into EU policymaking, and this shall not stop. The declaration precisely calls for the European Pillar of Social Rights to be mainstreamed in all relevant policy domains. Let me just mention the Economic Governance Review, where the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights has been anchored among the common priorities of the Union and the importance of upward social convergence recognised. This was part of our original legislative proposal and was further reinforced by your Parliament. Last week’s summit at La Hulpe marked an important step on the road since Porto, with the signing of the Declaration on the Future of Social Europe, and your House was well-represented. The declaration also reaffirms the necessity of effective social dialogue as a fundamental component of the European social model, and of European democracy. This declaration sends an important signal about the importance of keeping social at the heart of future EU policy, and reaffirms the relevance and importance of the pillar of social rights. The declaration takes a holistic look at employment and social policy. As always, it is about investing in people and providing supportive reforms. I would like to thank the Belgian Presidency for its work in bringing this process to a successful outcome, and for giving social the spotlight it deserves. We have a new roadmap for promoting social policies, adapted to the new challenges and addressing inequalities that still divide our societies. We must consolidate our achievements and go further ahead. As a still stand would be the biggest error. I would also like to give my heartfelt thanks to this House for your support and your energy. Over the past five years, even at the toughest times, you have continued to push for progress. You have proposed innovative ideas and called for a European Child Guarantee. You have adopted legislative resolutions calling for EU legislation on telework and the right to disconnect, on asbestos and the new exposure limits to dangerous substances at work to protect workers. You have called for a revision of the European Works Councils Directive and called for legislation on traineeships. This Commission has always followed up. The question now is where should we go from here? The La Hulpe Declaration will help us to shape a Europe that provides more opportunities, more equality and less poverty. A Europe that is more resilient, inclusive and competitive, with people at its centre – including by helping lift people, and particularly the young – up when they have lost their way. A Europe where people can learn new skills, move between sectors, earn decent wages, enjoy a good work-life balance and feel secure. A major driver for making this a reality is that it is what EU citizens want and expect. In the latest Eurobarometer survey, published this month, nine out of ten people – 88% across the EU – said a social Europe is important to them personally. We also asked them what they felt should be the biggest priority in their country, and the answer is ‘tackling the high cost of living’ is by far the most frequently-mentioned issue. This confirms that strengthening the social dimension of our Union is indispensable. This has to be done in full respect of subsidiarity – but we cannot build a strong Union, assuring security in a more unstable geopolitical environment, without giving clear responses to citizens’ concerns, difficulties and sometimes also fears. Last week, after addressing the summit at La Hulpe, Enrico Letta presented his report on the future of the single market. He says clearly that further development of the single market can only be successful if it includes a genuine social dimension that ensures social justice and cohesion. The latter report also involves important developments to services of general interest and universal access to essential services. This is also underlined in the declaration. The La Hulpe Declaration stresses how our social market economy makes social progress go hand-in-hand with a competitive and innovative economy. This is the real strength of Europe. The foundation also of our democracy. This is what we signed up, and what we must deliver together.",-,2024-04-24,17.

Mathieu Michel,"Mr President, honourable Members, Commissioner, thank you for this frank and open exchange, which has certainly enabled us to clarify our respective positions. Allow me once again to reaffirm the importance that Council attaches to the role of parliamentary committees of inquiry in our European democracy. An adequate level of control and political accountability is essential, and the current legal framework is a solid foundation. Let me be very clear. The Council has always acted in full respect of the duty of sincere and loyal cooperation on this file. Over the last 12 years, it has duly and carefully examined each and every Parliament proposal, and has continuously acted in a constructive spirit with a view to achieving progress. Parliament and Council are therefore not co-legislators here and they are not meant to enter trilogue negotiations. It is in fact up to Parliament to put forward a proposal that has reasonable chances to obtain consent from its counterparts. In this perspective, the European Parliament is well aware of the serious political and legal concerns which the Council and the Commission raised very early on. I acknowledge the many proposals the European Parliament has made over the years, but those have unfortunately resulted insufficient to alleviate many of the concerns raised. As set out in our last letter, the latest Parliament proposal fails to address many of the serious political and legal concerns previously raised by the Council. These relate in particular to incompatibilities, Article 5, conduct of investigation, Article 12, and despite investigations and fact finding missions, Article 13, hearing of officials and other servants of the Union, Articles 15 and 17, of members of Member States governments, Article 16, and of natural persons, Article 18, requests for documents, expert reports. I will not go into more detail here, although I wish to further convey, as expressed by many Member States, that the prerogatives proposed by the European Parliament would go much beyond those of many EU national parliaments. In that sense, the powers which the European Parliament is willing to confer upon its committees of inquiry would go beyond the spirit and scope of Article 226 of the TFEU, which is a fundamental red line for the Council. Our dialogue may continue and the Council stands ready to examine any further Parliament proposal. There is always room for improvement, and I hope that the next legislature will enable us to make progress on this issue. It is certainly in our common interests to guarantee all stakeholders a clear, up-to-date legal framework in keeping with the rule of law and the treaties.",-,2024-04-24,13.

This isn’t the first time we have demanded the release and a better condition and better medical care for Dr Ibadoghlu, whose life is at risk due to a lack of medical attention. He needs urgent surgery abroad, which is still not possible due to the travel ban. We call for the immediate release of all other political prisoners, such as Ilhamiz Guliyev and hundreds of others, including ethnic Armenian in Baku. To stress our point, we call again on the Commission to consider suspending the strategic partnership with Azerbaijan in the energy sector. We know how sensitive this issue is, but we are convinced that the EU cannot have strong relations with a country that is continuously violating human rights. Any further partnership agreements must be conditioned on the release of all political prisoners and the improvement of the overall human rights situation in the country.

Hannes Heide,"Mr President, Commissioner, Ghana has developed into a reliable partner of the European Union, offering its citizens stability and prospects. Remarkable progress has been made, particularly in the areas of digitisation, economic and social development. First steps toward green transition have been taken and the death penalty was abolished last year. Regrettably, Ghana’s parliament passed a draconian bill in February that carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison for anyone who identifies with LGBTI+ and up to five years in prison for funding LGBTI+ groups. One year after the European Parliament adopted a resolution on global discrimination of homosexuality, this bill in Ghana risks the creation of one of the most restrictive LGBTI+ laws in Africa. I call on the Commission and Member States to immediately engage in a dialogue with the Ghanaian Government and civil society organisations to tackle the growing culture of discrimination and intolerance. I appeal to President Nana Akufo-Addo – whose speech here in the House we have fond memories of – not to sign the law, a law that is in stark contradiction to universal human rights, would undo all the efforts of recent years and jeopardise the stable partnership with Europe.",S&D,2024-04-24,"21.

Karen Melchior,"Mr President, thank you very much to the Commission and the two rapporteurs for their work on this piece of legislation. We have actually been extending our borders to the airports of other countries with the system that we have in place. The current update is an improvement on the data rights of all of the passengers coming into Europe. But we cannot look away from the fact that we talk about having legal pathways for legal migrants and asylum seekers. But we have stopped the most effective, safest and modern ways of transport for these people, because we are asking the airlines to stop people that do not have a visa to come into the EU. And you do not get a visa if an embassy, an EU embassy, fears that you will seek asylum. So therefore, with the great work that has been done with adopting the asylum and migration package two weeks ago, we need to make sure that this system that we’ve adopted, which is an improvement on the existing system, does not hinder the protection of refugees across the world.

Tineke Strik,"Mr President, my group has fundamental concerns about the necessity and proportionality of the mandatory collection of API data, as well as about the transition to automated check-ins only. Still, the text improves the status quo with clear, harmonised European rules on API collection. We also set limits and safeguards. Where Member States now do whatever they want, this revision will shorten the data retention periods and create more safeguards. And finally, after all these years, we bring the collection of API and PNR data in line with the PNR judgment, with clarified selection criteria for intra-EU flights, additional privacy safeguards, and the prohibition of profiling and collecting biometric data. So although API data collection is now mandatory, which we regret, there are also much clearer limits and safeguards. So I would like to thank both rapporteurs, Ms Kanko and Mr Oetjen, for this result and for the good cooperation also with the Commission. And we can conclude this cooperation in the very last voting session of this term, so congratulations for that. Catch-the-eye procedure",Greens/EFA,2024-04-24,"22.

Jeroen Lenaers,"Mr President, this is the last late night debate of this mandate of the European Parliament. So it’s rather fitting that it is dedicated to such an important topic. And I would like to congratulate the co-rapporteurs Assita Kanko and Jan-Christoph Oetjen, for really bringing this important file to a very good and satisfying conclusion. Now, every year, over a billion passengers travel to, from or within the EU. And of course, this is good news because it means that Europe is and remains a very attractive place to be. But it obviously also comes with certain security implications. And we have a duty, all of us together, to make sure that Europe is as safe and secure as possible. We owe this to our citizens. And passenger information, especially when it’s combined with passenger name records, can really be useful to improve border controls, to reduce irregular migration, and to enhance our fight against serious crime and terrorism. And the existing API Directive has already really proven its value in this regard. But there were some elements that needed fixing. The uneven implementation in the Member States, and the fact that there was no mandatory collection of such data, meant that only 65% of incoming flights were actually checked in this way, making it fairly easy for those who wanted to avoid these checks to actually do so. This will no longer be possible. Everybody travelling to the EU will be subject to the same checks, and this is very important, just as it is important that we now can also use API data on intra-EU flights where this is relevant, in order to help our law enforcement authorities to do their job and keep us safe, and fully in line with the way we use PNR for the same data and in line with the Court of Justice ruling. Now, this is really an important element of the EU’s security strategy. It will close the loopholes that we see today and it will have a direct impact on the safety of us all. So I really look forward to its rapid implementation. And once again, thanks to the co-rapporteurs, to the Commission for the excellent proposal, which I agree, we actually managed to strengthen and improve in our negotiations and to all those involved, thank you very much.",PPE,2024-04-24,"22.

Virginijus Sinkevičius,"Mr President, honourable Members, also on behalf of the Commissioner Johansson, whom I’m replacing today, I want to thank rapporteurs for their excellent work on the two proposals on advanced passenger information. These new measures will make our Union safer and our borders smarter – objectives that most of us share with conviction. Air carriers will have to collect and transfer API data in a uniform way to all Member States of departure and destination of a flight. Member States will receive consistent API data, ensuring better border management in line with the Schengen Borders Code. When receiving API data before the arrival of air passengers, border guards will be able to pre-check this information against the Schengen Information System and other relevant databases. Pre-checks will allow border authorities to identify passengers not allowed to enter the EU, or passengers using false travel documents. Border guards will be able to focus on those passengers that require further attention, while facilitating the travel flow for the others. Therefore, border guards will be better prepared for the high-risk cases and travellers will save time. This is a clear win-win solution. By adopting the new regulations, we will be upgrading the 20-year-old API Directive, one of the priorities of the 2020 Security Union strategy. This upgrade has an important security dimension: it will allow border guards and police officers to close any loopholes that criminals exploit to date. The combined use of advanced passenger information data and passenger name record data will step up the fight against serious crime and terrorism. By analysing these two sets of data together, so-called false positives are usually reduced by half, which allows the police to better target their investigations on persons causing concern. At the same time, the work of air carriers will be facilitated by means of creating a single window – the router that EU agency eu-LISA will provide, to which all API and PNR data will have to be sent. Indeed, the establishment of a central router managed at the Union level is a major game-changer. It will replace the multiple connections between air carriers and the national authorities. It will bring significant efficiencies for air carriers on transfer cost and compliance with reporting obligations. Improved security for everyone, facilitated reporting obligations for air carriers: another win-win situation. In conclusion. I very much welcome the political agreement reached by the Parliament and Council because it is a very good one. It further reinforces the Commission’s initial proposals. It is a good example of productive and effective interinstitutional discussion. You have extended the router to passenger name record data in full compliance with data protection requirements set by the Court of Justice, and enhanced security in full compliance with fundamental rights. I call on you to support this political agreement for a safer Union and for smarter borders. Thank you for your attention.",-,2024-04-24,"22.

Assita Kanko,"Mr President, thank you, colleague Oetjen. I would also like to thank my good colleague Jan-Christoph and all the shadow rapporteurs. I think we made a very effective negotiating team. We found compromises, first within the Parliament and then with the Council, in a very positive atmosphere. And we brought in a lot of good points for Parliament and, more importantly, for our European citizens. I believe that these regulations are going to prove very useful in the fight against terrorism and organised crime. At the moment, 27 Member States and hundreds of airlines use a wide range of separate systems to send passenger data to countries of destination. The passenger data are collected in a self-declaratory manner. Of course, the vast majority of travellers are of goodwill, but the bad guys find ways to abuse the system and travel in and out of the EU undetected. I think that with the solutions we found, we will make life more difficult for criminals and terrorists, but easier for travellers, air carriers and Member State authorities. Now, picking up from my colleague Jan-Christoph, the first point I wanted to mention here is the new Article 5a in API law enforcement on the selection of intra-EU flights. It was not in the Commission proposal, but we made a proposal in the Parliament mandate. The reason is that the European Court of Justice 2 years ago ruled that PNR data may be collected for internal EU flights and shared with law enforcement authorities, but strict limitations will have to apply. The text we have agreed stays fully within the Court ruling on the PNR Directive, whilst offering the Member States and the Commission concrete tools for the implementation of this ruling. I am glad that we could also agree the 12-month deadline for reviews of the assessment. With everything we put in place, we make sure that people’s privacy is protected. The second point worth highlighting here today is that we agreed to move towards mandatory use of the router for PNR data as well. From Parliament’s side, we believed from the start that this would be wise. Most importantly, it will improve privacy oversight. It can truly help with the implementation and supervision of the Court ruling on PNR. It can also lead to a streamlining that is beneficial for air carriers and Member States alike. I think that the phasing approach is the right one, and I would like to thank the Commission for the updated legislative financial statement, which shows the commitment to make the router work also for PNR data starting in 2028. Thirdly, I would like to mention a point that was a bit more difficult for Parliament, namely, what to do in case of technical impossibility to use the router. Throughout the negotiations, Parliament always wanted to stay very closely within the scope of the regulations and avoid any parallel systems. However, we do understand that, in some exceptional cases, Member State authorities may need to ask air carriers for API data via other means if the central system managed by eu-LISA is down. I am glad that the Council accepted our wish to add some extra safeguards, and I trust that with the triple backup of the system, these situations will in any case be extremely rare. Finally, from my side, I would also like to underline our flexibility in accepting the Council’s text on the governance structure. We believe it is a bit unusual to be so specific at the level of the main legislation. However, we also do understand the Council’s desire to give clarity and legal certainty about the various groups and bodies involved in preparing and monitoring the system. Let me take this opportunity to again thank my colleagues, rapporteur Oetjen and the shadows, including Jeroen Lenaers and Tineke Strik, who are present here, and I think we were able to step over all kinds of difficulties from time to time, and we can be proud of the agreement on these important regulations.

Mairead McGuinness,"Mr President, colleagues, time is of the essence, so I will be quick. I am here on behalf of EVP Šefčovič, but I want to state on his behalf and, indeed, on behalf of the Commission, that we recognise absolutely the importance of the European Parliament’s right of inquiry. I can speak of my own experience as an MEP, just how important that right of inquiry is. I chaired a committee of inquiry in 2006, on the collapse of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, and our work identified issues around weak financial regulation on which there was follow-up action. But it is also worth noting that this right of inquiry must be exercised by Parliament within the limits of the powers in the Treaties, and in line with the procedures, conditions and objectives set out there. In 2012, the Parliament adopted its proposal to revise the 1995 Decision that now governs the exercise of Parliament’s right of inquiry. Since then, regrettably, there has been little progress. The Commission has never objected to engaging in any interinstitutional dialogue. In fact, it is quite the opposite. As stated on several occasions during structured dialogues with AFCO and in previous debate on this topic in June 2021, the Commission has always been open to constructive trilateral discussions to address any remaining issues before giving its consent according to Article 226 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Just to recall, this is a special legislative procedure. While it is for Parliament to make the proposal, the procedure requires the consent of both Council and Commission. So therefore, in the spirit of sincere cooperation, any Parliament position or proposal, including non-papers, should be transmitted to both Commission and Council. The Commission takes note of the updated non-paper received from Parliament, which aims to take, and I quote, ‘a considerable step towards the Council’s position, after which no further substantial concessions from the Parliament’s side could be possible’. The Commission acknowledges some progress in this updated non-paper; of note, deleting the provision allowing Parliament, in effect, to impose sanctions in the case of a failure to fully cooperate with a committee of inquiry. But there are still outstanding issues which should be further discussed in interinstitutional negotiations. These include the conduct of investigations, hearings of members of EU institutions, hearings of EU officials and other staff, hearings of other individuals, and requests for documents. In addition, the Commission regrets that Parliament recently decided unilaterally to introduce some amendments to its Rules of Procedure that relate to Parliament’s inquiry powers.

Virginijus Sinkevičius,"Mr President, honourable Members, Ghana is a solid democracy, an anchor of regional stability, and has a strong record in terms of protecting human rights throughout its laws and through its practice. Significant steps have been taken in this area. See, for example, Ghana’s decision of last year to take steps towards abolishing the death penalty. However, challenges remain, notably in the area of the protection of sexual minorities. The recent passing in parliament of the Human Sexual Rights and Family Values Act, more commonly referred to as the anti LGBTIQ Bill, is an issue of concern in Ghana, as is the case in any other country on the continent and in the world. In its current form, the bill requires close review in light of Ghana’s international and constitutional human-rights commitments. The constitutionality of the bill has been challenged and it is currently scrutinised by the Supreme Court. It is also to be noted that the bill also still requires presidential assent to enter into force. The president has publicly reiterated his commitment on the respect of human rights, and has expressed his concern to seeing a backsliding on human rights in the event of adoption of the bill. Senior members of the Ghanaian Government have also highlighted the bill’s potential financial consequences and losses for the 2024 budget. We are therefore confident that Ghana will stand firm in the commitments it has made on national and international human rights. The EU, together with Member States, have followed the matter closely since its introduction in 2021. Our position and concerns on the matter are well known and regularly communicated. Ghana has a pivotal role in ensuring regional stability and an increasingly volatile region, marked by spill-over of insecurity from the Sahel to the Gulf of Guinea countries. The European Union has succeeded in further deepening its partnership with Ghana, as it evolved from a strictly developmental partnership to a more political one that is fit to face regional political and security challenges. It is therefore of utmost importance that we remain close and build upon Ghana and use already strong partnership to defend our common values.",-,2024-04-24,"21.

Virginijus Sinkevičius,"Mr President, before I begin my speech, let me applaud Members of the Parliament – Reinhard Bütikofer, Mr Castaldo for their constant fight for the human rights and being the champions of defending what is the base of our Union. Thank you very much for that. President, honourable Members, the EU has repeatedly expressed its grave concerns about the national security law that Beijing imposed on Hong Kong in June 2020. Since then, hundreds of opposition politicians, journalists, civil society activists have been arrested. Independent media outlets were forced to close, many civil society organisations disbanded. This has seriously undermined the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong. The new national security legislation that was adopted on 19 March threatens to further accelerate the erosion of fundamental freedoms and political pluralism in Hong Kong. The definition of state secrets found in the new legislation is exceedingly broad, and imports the definitions prevailing in mainland China to Hong Kong. The law features sweeping stipulations on external interference that are likely to affect engagement with international organisations. Other troubling aspects are significantly increased penalties and expanded powers for the police and Chief Executive. A bill including such far-reaching changes would have required ample time to allow for thorough scrutiny. However, the law was adopted hastily, only 20 days after the end of a one-month public consultation process. The High Representative issued a statement on behalf of the European Union on the new legislation on 19 March. All EU Member States supported the statement. This underlines the EU’s serious concerns about this law. The EU will closely monitor the application of national security legislation and the impact on the exercise of rights and freedoms by the people of Hong Kong. The EU office in Hong Kong is closely following the trial against Jimmy Lai and regularly attending court hearings. Andy Li is a key prosecution witness in this case. The EU shares concerns highlighted by the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture that evidence against Jimmy Lai may have been obtained by torture. These allegations should be investigated thoroughly and transparently. The EU office in Hong Kong also regularly attended the trial against Joseph John, including the sentencing two weeks ago. Joseph John is a holder of a Portuguese passport and Hong Kong identity documents. He was arrested by the Hong Kong National Security Police on 1 November 2022 and sentenced to five years under the national security law for incitement to secession on 11 April. This case is another example of the harsh restrictions of freedom of expression in Hong Kong.",-,2024-04-24,20.3.

Civil rights in Hong Kong are by now fully curbed, and the reinforced security law made it even more chilling. But how did we get here? The PRC imposed security legislation, formalising already existing pressure on Hong Kong, in clear breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. The UK, nobody ever really attached effective consequences to this breach. And we know how autocrats perceive this: ‘Oh, we can go ahead!’ Free media silenced, Jimmy Lai in prison, Andy Li and Joseph John arrested and tortured, democracy defenders fleeing the country without saying goodbye to family – and even then, they are not safe from Beijing’s long arm.

What happens in the Indo-Pacific, even though it’s far away, concerns us Europeans centrally. That’s why this Parliament has made an outspoken, realistic and united China policy one of our trademarks. Today’s urgency raises, in particular, the individual cases of Andy Li and Joseph John. We not only criticise how they’re being treated – even tortured – and demand their freedom, as much as we demand freedom for Jimmy Lai and all other Democrats, but we also call upon the EU authorities to act vis-à-vis Hong Kong: sanction John Lee, Beijing’s spineless vassal in Hong Kong; suspend all still existing extradition treaties with Hong Kong and China; and keep the memory of Hong Kong’s democracy movement alive, and carry the torch of freedom forward.",Greens/EFA,2024-04-24,20.3.

Miriam Lexmann,"Mr President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, Article 23 is the final nail into the coffin for fundamental human rights and free society in Hong Kong. Beijing, together with its lackeys in the Hong Kong administration, have destroyed the city’s freedoms. They broke international agreements and they have either locked up or forced to flee the brightest of the city’s citizens. What has happened in Hong Kong is both a telling example of how the totalitarian regime works, but it is also a warning for all of us. The daily attempts to undermine our democracies, including in this House, shine true light on these regimes and its aims. This is why we need urgent EU action on Hong Kong, particularly holding accountable those Chinese and Hong Kong officials like John Lee, responsible for the destruction of the freedom in the city. Moreover, we need stronger protection of our citizens, including dual nationals targeted by Chinese transnational oppression. At the very end, let me express sincere gratitude to all colleagues, and especially to Reinhard Bütikofer, for all their cooperation over the past four years in standing up for freedom in the face of the totalitarian CCP. Working across political divides, the European Parliament has become a leading voice for a changing EU stance towards the CCP, one that is more principled, that protects our democratic institutions and societies, that defends our economic security, and, above all, that stands up for those countless voices oppressed by the Communist regime. Let me say a big ‘thank you’, but let me also take this opportunity to urge the Commission and the Council to finally step up too.",PPE,2024-04-24,20.3.

Virginijus Sinkevičius,"Mr President, honourable Members, following nearly two decades of dictatorship, The Gambia has presented a positive story since it returned to democracy in 2017. It has demonstrated a commitment to defending human rights and multilateralism, with the UN at its core. It has voted in solidarity with Ukraine. It has been at the forefront of many human rights battles, including the Rohingyas in Myanmar. It is a respected member of the United Nations Human Rights Council. In this positive context, the bill to repeal the ban on female genital mutilation, suggested by an independent National Assembly member, casts a shadow over the reputation of The Gambia. However, it should be made clear that this initiative does not come from the government. The EU has already taken steps to discuss with the Gambian authorities in quiet diplomacy. We have shared our concerns and passed strong messages through our EU Ambassador, as well as through the EU Special Representative for Human Rights. While respecting alternative cultures and traditions, the EU is against all gender-based violence. The EU has convened the view that legal protection of young women provided for by this 2015 law should not disappear. If it did, it would represent a substantial setback for the status of women in the country. The Gambian Government, from all our contacts, shares our concerns, and there is much hope that the National Assembly would vote against this initiative. The matter needs to be approached in a way that is sensitive to local politics. Much needs to be done to avoid reinforcing the position and arguments of the bill sponsors, who often present themselves as defenders of The Gambia’s traditions and culture against the influence and interference of foreign actors. We need to move forward in a way that bases our approach firmly on the commitments already made by The Gambia and its leaders. Of course, we will continue to broaden our outreach to key political actors in the National Assembly, which is currently examining the proposal at the committee level. We will continue to encourage The Gambia based on its commitments to reject these proposals. SĒDI VADA: ROBERTS ZĪLE Priekšsēdētājas vietnieks",-,2024-04-24,20.2.

Assita Kanko,"Mr President, female genital mutilation is a brutal practice that breaks and destroys girls on the basis of sex, making them a property of the community or a man. Female genital mutilation has happened to 200 million women worldwide. I’m one of them. Believe me, no one can imagine such physical and mental pain or the lifelong consequences you have to bear. Today, female genital mutilation continues despite all laws. It breaks my heart when I see the governments of the Gambia wanting to repeal the law banning female genital mutilation, instead of protecting girls. It’s vital that we do all we can to convince the Gambia’s Parliament not to decriminalise female genital mutilation, vital because it could literally cost girls’ and women’s lives or adversely affect their quality of life. It’s also a dangerous precedent, as this could lead to a wave of reduction of women’s rights in other countries. The Commission and the European External Action Service should urge the Gambian authorities to honour their human-rights commitments and enforce the legal ban on female genital mutilation. The law against female genital mutilation is not a law against their religion or culture. It is a human right that protects and improves the lives of women and girls.",ECR,2024-04-24,20.2.

Svenja Hahn,"Mr President, dear colleagues, female genital mutilation is such an incredible, terrible and brutal violation of human rights. It is not justified by any religion or culture. It is abusive, it is harmful, and it leads to irreparable damage. It is psychological damage, physical damage, it is reproductive and sexual health damage. It can lead to death, and if girls are lucky enough to survive it, they will be affected for their whole life. As a woman, as a politician, I am deeply worried that The Gambia is looking into lifting the ban on female genital mutilation. It would be the first time ever that this protection of women’s rights would be reversed – and with the numbers of women affected, it is shocking. Around 76 % of Gambian women between 15 and 49 have been circumcised, or 230 million girls and women worldwide are affected. As the European Parliament, we call on the Gambian Parliament: demonstrate your country’s commitment to international human rights law and the multiple international and regional agreements The Gambia has signed – and I expect the European Commission to join the efforts from this Parliament.

Virginijus Sinkevičius,"Mr President, the rule of law and human rights are at the core of the EU’s relations with Azerbaijan, and it will continue to be an important part of our dialogue. We have repeatedly raised our concerns about the intensification of persecution against civil society and independent media in Azerbaijan, which we see as an attempt to intimidate and silence dissenting voices and suppress freedom of expression. Today, we are focusing on two cases of detention on politically motivated charges, but repression against many dissident voices in Azerbaijan continues. Dr Gubad Ibadoghlu is a well-known Azerbaijani economist, political opponent and vocal critic of the government, who has been held in pre-trial detention since July 2023. Mr Guliyev is a political activist who has been in pre-trial detention since December 2023. Since November 2023, we have seen several waves of arrests of independent journalists and political activists affiliated with a number of media outlets and non-governmental organisations. At least 16 people have been detained, among them Ilhamiz Guliyev. Since the last debate in this Chamber and the resolution adopted on Dr Ibadoghlu, we have repeatedly raised our concerns on the rights of detained persons, including their access to medical assistance, independent doctors and the International Committee of the Red Cross, both in direct contact with the authorities and in public statements. We continue to call on Azerbaijan to uphold its obligations under international law. The EU delegation in Baku also regularly conducts trial-monitoring in politically motivated cases like those of Dr Gubad Ibadoghlu, political activist Ilhamiz Guliyev, seriously ill journalist Alasgar Mammadli, public activist Baxtiyar Haciyev, and others. It has also repeatedly requested to visit Dr Ibadoghlu and other prisoners. Civil society organisations in Azerbaijan are operating under difficult circumstances. Support for these organisations is and will remain a key priority for the European Union, with currently more than EUR 12 million in assistance. We also continue to call on the authorities to allow civil society organisations to operate freely in the country.

All the trumped-up charges against him must be dropped, and he must be allowed to travel abroad to undergo medical treatment. At the same time, after the ethnic cleansing of Christian Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh, the regime continues to threaten Armenia and thwart efforts towards sustainable peace. This reality is all the more haunting today as we commemorate the anniversary of the 1915 Armenian Genocide. The world failed to act in 1915, and it failed to act again this year when over 100 000 Armenians had to flee their homeland. The phrase ‘never again’ cannot be just empty words.

It is a day we longed for since regaining our freedom in the late 1980s and early 1990s. I remember feeling immense pride at our countries that, after decades in shadows of oppressive communist regimes, in just 15 short years we were welcomed in the European Union. Reflecting on the past two decades, I am struck by the remarkable progress we have made. I see the spread of our shared democratic values across the continent.

We face attempts for disintegrating the Union from the inside, attacks on its core values and principles, erosions of the rule of law and attempts to curtail democracy in several European countries. We must continue to strive for an ever-closer Union: one that is inclusive, sustainable and prosperous. A Union capable of swift actions. A Union which is immune to blackmail, not only from the outside, but mainly not from the inside. A Union that stands as a major global player.

Dita Charanzová,"Madam President, dear Presidents, dear Prime Ministers, dear Ministers, dear colleagues, 24 years ago Václav Havel addressed this Parliament and spoke about European identity and enlargement. He spoke of turning Europe’s turbulent history into one of a profoundly fair and peaceful order, based on the principle of equality and cooperation by all sides, where understanding and general consensus guide Europe. Four years later, he lived to see his dream fulfilled with the enlargement to the Czech Republic and nine other European countries. My country joining the European Union was one of the proudest moments in my life. The barrier between the East and West – gone. Yet the discussion continued after enlargement: new versus old Member States, EU-10 versus EU-15, east versus west. Twenty years on, I am truly glad that there is no longer an ‘us’ or ‘them’, but only a ‘we’. We still have national interests, but we are all equal members of the same club. We are one European Union. Twenty years on, we must not give in to those that wish to take us back. We must not give in to those who speak of Brussels or Strasbourg as something to fight against. If you don’t like it, then reform it – but we must refuse to go back to nationalism. We must refuse to go back to the divided Europe of our parents. Havel’s dream didn’t end with enlargement 20 years ago. He dreamed of the continent as a whole being united. Now is the time to continue his dream, and I look forward to welcoming more members to our club, where dialogue replaces hate and wars. I am a proud Czech and I am a proud European. Twenty years on, I am proud to be both at the same time, and for this I will always be grateful.",Renew,2024-04-24,5.

Pat Cox,"Madam President, Members of the European Parliament, Madam President von der Leyen and Members of the European Commission, Representatives of the Belgian Presidency, distinguished guests young and, like myself, less young, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure and privilege for me to be here today, to mark and to celebrate the 20th anniversary of our Union’s Big Bang enlargement of 20 years ago, in the presence of so many persons whose leadership and dedication, as those who went before them, were indispensable to the realisation of that great enlargement. Thank you, President Metsola, for proposing this initiative today. At a flag raising ceremony on 3 May 2004, here in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, we welcomed the parliamentary speakers and the nominated Members of this Parliament of the ten new Member States from central, eastern and southern Europe. In a Europe finally breathing on its two lungs, east and west. Symbolically, the ten new flagpoles were made in, and travelled from, the shipyards in Gdansk. These were a gift from the Polish nation, which the then Prime Minister of Poland, my friend Leszek Miller, offered at my request. I thank you here today, Leszek, for that gift, whose passage from Gdansk to Strasbourg symbolised our continent’s journey from an imposed post-war Soviet domination to each nation’s right to choose. Permit me to share my regret that the United Kingdom chose to leave our Union. But it revealed one powerful truth about who and what we are, namely, a voluntary union of free and sovereign peoples. Free to join. Free to leave. As war returns to our continent, what a total contrast to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, where the imperial and deceitful unity proposed by Vladimir Putin is coming from the barrel of a gun. The blast of a ballistic missile, or the indiscriminate impact of deathly drones. In the 1990s and the 2000s, waves of positive stimulus were released globally and in Europe. Key among them, the fall of the Iron Curtain, the integration of post-communist states of Central and Eastern Europe into the EU, German reunification and the entry of China into the World Trade Organisation. We live today in different times, in a new age of contest and uncertainty, one where Europe’s collective interests and values can be expressed effectively on the world stage. Only through coherent vision and European unity of purpose. The European Union is heavily invested in post-war norms and institutions. From the outset, our values and interests have been well served by them. The defence, reform and promotion of effective multilateralism is central to our strategic goals, but it is set to be challenged more in the future than the past. I believe our multipolar world is transforming into a multi-order world of contested multilateralism and, moreover, for our continent, unsettled by the war in Ukraine. The comfort blanket of US security guarantees, whether they remain in place or not, are unlikely to be cost free in terms of EU policy choices. Public opinion, politics and governments in the West today, with the possible exception of combating climate change, seem to be more focussed on vulnerabilities than the benefits associated with interdependence than in the early decades of this century. That is why here in Europe, the USA and elsewhere, the world is now facing the most consequential elections of the modern era. Hovering between contested continuity or drastic discontinuity. This Parliament, and I don’t need to tell you, has always been a parliament of minorities. No group ever held a majority in this House on its own. Policy here is built on de facto coalitions. I would call on all those political forces who have been reliably and consistently European, to rally once more to the cause of coherence and unity of purpose after the parliamentary elections. Your collective wisdom and capacity to influence still will be essential to what comes next. Madam President, as we acknowledge a successful past enlargement here today, let us remember, as you have done in your speech, all those states now are waiting their hour of European self-expression. The next mandate of both the European Parliament and of the European Commission, needs to assist their transitions towards membership and simultaneously to prepare our Union’s institutional and financial capacity to absorb them. I have just returned from the latest European Parliament Democracy Support mission to Ukraine last weekend. Thanks to you, Madam President. At this time of profound and unrelenting stress, Ukraine needs the reassurance of our solidarity and of our openness, in due course, to embrace its entry into the Union. Concerning future enlargements, and I will conclude with this, today’s event recalls, we have done this before successfully, and today’s message should be and must be that we can and we will do this again. To paraphrase the Schuman Declaration, in order to underwrite our Union’s sustainable success, we will need and you in this Parliament will need to make creative efforts proportionate to the dangers which threaten us. Madam President, behind you, we have our European flag and symbol as it sits before us who look at the speaker’s podium. You will see that it is a circle which in heraldry represents harmony. We see that it is the stars which everywhere in our literature and poetry invites us to dream our dreams. But we see most of all about this harmonious circle, that it is open and not closed. And the message must be it is open to all those European states who share our fundamental values and who wish to be, as the ten states we celebrate today, part of our family and to be welcomed home.",-,2024-04-24,5.

Ursula von der Leyen,"Madam President, dear Roberta, excellencies, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, when the clock struck midnight on 1 May 2004, a whole continent burst into celebration. The flames of bonfires lit up the night in the Baltic states. A thousand fireworks coloured the sea around Malta and Cyprus and the lakes of Slovenia. And the Ode to Joy resonated in the cities of central and eastern Europe previously on the other side of the Iron Curtain. It was not just the birth of a larger Union. It was the birth of a new era. It was a night of promise. Because Europe is promise: the promise that all Europeans can be masters of their own destiny; the promise of freedom and stability, peace and prosperity. In the 20 years that followed, this promise has been fulfilled. Our fellow Europeans in the then new Member States have seen their countries transformed. Your economies boomed. Your cultural production has tripled. Your unemployment rates have been cut by half. The power of Europe, together with your ingenuity, has brought a true economic miracle to all your countries. In so many different ways, Europe has made you stronger. But you have made Europe so much stronger too. People and companies across Europe have enjoyed new opportunities to study and work, export and invest in a wider Union. You have empowered our response to the geopolitical challenges we face. From our eastern Members’ resolute support to Ukraine, to Cyprus’s leadership in opening a maritime corridor for aid to Gaza. Thanks to you, Europe’s voice on the global stage is much more powerful. Dear friends, on 1 May 2004, my predecessor, President Prodi, who is here today, pronounced prophetic words. You, President Prodi, said, ‘Today’s enlargement is the fifth and the largest in the history of the Union, and it will not be the last.’ You were so right. Since then, three more countries have joined our Union. And today, the desire to unite Europe and complete our Union is more important than ever before. The Western Balkans is moving ever closer to us. We took the historic decision to launch negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova, while the people of Georgia make no secret of their European dreams. Honourable Members, it is right that we look forward to future enlargement as we mark the success of the last 20 years. But, at the same time, it is my duty today to pass a very stark message about the future of our Union. Because what happens in Ukraine will shape the future of our Union forever. We cannot overlook and we cannot overstate that Russia poses an existential threat not only to Ukraine, but also to Europe. A Putin win would not only change the map, it would not only mask the face of the Ukrainian nation, but it would change the course of European history. Our Union would never be the same. Ukraine is carrying this heavy burden on its shoulders for all of us and it is paying the ultimate price every day for that. We have seen the devastating attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure and the difficult days on the battlefield. My friends, there is only one way to face up to this. There is only one language Putin understands and that is providing Ukraine with means to defend themselves. Putin believed that we would not stand up for democracy and independence in Ukraine. He was wrong. Putin believed that US military support would not pass the US Congress. He was wrong again. The military assistance from the United States and our assistance from the European Union is an encouragement for all of us to do even more. We must be very clear about this: for Europe to win the future, just as it did 20 years ago. Ukraine must win. (Applause) Honourable Members, excellencies, Ukraine has made its European choice. You know what this means. And we have made our Ukrainian choice, just like we made our choice all those years ago, when we welcomed so many countries back home to our Union. The decisions we took together in the 1990s and 2000s led to that very special ‘day of welcomes’ in Phoenix Park in Ireland. It led to one of the great European success stories. The decisions we will take in the next days, weeks and months will decide who wins the future of Europe. So, together, let’s stay united. Let’s stay strong with Ukraine. Let’s stay ambitious on enlargement and reform. This is how we will make good on that European promise once again, just as we did 20 years ago. Long live the generation of 2004 and long live Europe. (Applause)",-,2024-04-24,5.

President,"Good morning to you all. Can I ask you to take your seats as we begin this momentous occasion. Distinguished guests, dear Members, dear Europeans, it is truly an honour to welcome you to the European Parliament to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the 2004 European Union enlargement – the largest single enlargement in the history of the European Union. To start, I would like to invite you to watch a short video clip in which ten young Europeans who were born in May 2004 in the ten acceding countries speak about what it means for them to be European. (A video was played)    Presidenti, Prim Ministri, Ministri, Kummissarji, Mistednin distinti, Membri, kollegi, Għeżież Ewropej, Bħal mijiet ta’ individwi f’din il-Kamra, u miljuni ta’ Ewropej madwar il-kontinent, ma ninsa qatt fejn kont fil-lejl ta’ bejn it-30 ta’ April u l-1 ta’ Mejju 2004. 20 sena ilu, kont il-Belt Valletta – ma’ eluf kbar ta’ nies, bl-attenzjoni tagħna kollha ffukata fuq in-naħa l-oħra tal-Port il-Kbir, kif għadna kif rajna fil-filmat. Konna qed ngħoddu l-minuti u s-sekondi sakemm Malta, flimkien ma’ Ċipru, ir-Repubblika Ċeka, l-Estonja, l-Ungerija, il-Latvja, il-Litwanja, il-Polonja, is-Slovakkja u s-Slovenja ssieħbu fl-Unjoni Ewropea. Dik il-folla enormi tibqa’ stampata f’moħħi għal dejjem. Pajjiż sħiħ ħerqan għal futur ta’ possibilitajiet, ta’ tama. Poplu li għaraf il-potenzjal tiegħu, li seta’ jħares ’il quddiem b’ottimiżmu. Sentimenti li dakinhar kienu qed jinħassu minn tant nies madwar l-Ewropa. Għal miljuni ta’ persuni s-sħubija fl-Unjoni Ewropea fissret tiġdid, sens ta’ kburija, fissret għaqda. F’daqqa waħda, l-futur ma kellux limiti. Fissret sigurtà, fissret opportunità, fissret prosperità. Għalina fissret kollox. Niftakarni naħseb f’dawk il-ġenerazzjonijiet ta’ Ewropej li għalihom, l-Unjoni Ewropea kienet biss ħolma li issa saret realtà. Kif – minkejja l-isfidi kollha – irnexxielna negħlbu l-biża’ tal-passat u minflok inwittu t-triq tal-era ġdida ta’ libertà, ta’ paċi, ta’ prosperità madwar il-kontinent. Fejn dak li qabel kien kontinent mifrud, issa sar ħaġa waħda. Mit-tramuntana għan-nofsinhar, mill-lvant għall-punent, mill-Baltiċi għall-Mediterran - magħqudin, flimkien. U llum, f’ġenerazzjoni ġdida, huma n-nies tal-Ukrajna, il-pajjiżi tal-Balkani tal-Punent, il-Moldova u l-Georgia li qed iħarsu lejn l-Ewropa bl-istess sens ta’ tama lejn futur komuni. Kif għamlet fit-tkabbir tal-2004 u fl-integrazzjoni tal-Bulgarija, ir-Rumanija u l-Kroazja fis-snin ta’ wara, l-Ewropa llum ma tistax tħares in-naħa l-oħra. Għeżież ħbieb, fl-aħħar żewġ deċennji, l-Ewropa ffaċċjat sfidi bla preċedent. Imma flimkien, irnexxielna nindirizzawhom u negħlbuhom. Kien hemm mumenti – fl-aktar ċirkustanzi diffiċli – li kien aktar faċli li nerħulha għal rasna. Imma rreżistejna. Għaliex fhimna li minkejja l-frustrazzjonijiet u l-imperfezzjonijiet tagħha, l-Unjoni Ewropea hija l-aqwa garanzija għalina lkoll. L-effett ta’ trasformazzjoni tat-tkabbir tal-Unjoni Ewropea fuq il-ħajja tal-Ewropej għadu jinħass sal-ġurnata tal-lum. Narawh u nħossuh f’kull Stat Membru. Smajna dwaru wkoll miż-żgħażagħ li jiena kburija ferm li huma kollha magħqudin magħna llum: drittijiet għal kull ċittadin, opportunitajiet għal kull persuna mill-kbir għaż-żgħir, suq wieħed li qed isaħħaħ l-ekonomiji, politika ta’ koeżjoni li timplimenta l-impenn tagħna għall-ugwaljanza. Is-sħubija fl-Unjoni Ewropea ma fissritx biss liġijiet ġodda. Fissret ferm aktar minn hekk. Fl-istess ħin, l-għaqda ma tfissirx li kulħadd għandu jkun l-istess. Dik mhux l-Ewropa tagħna. Aħna kburin bid-differenzi ta’ bejnietna, bit-tradizzjonijiet uniċi, bil-kulturi, bil-lingwi, bid-diversità tagħna. L-aħħar 20 sena nistgħu ngħidu li huma prova proprju ta’ dan. Pjuttost l-Ewropa tħaddan id-differenzi, filwaqt li tassigura li kulħadd ikollu l-istess opportunitajiet. Kulħadd għandu jkollu l-istess ċans, anke jekk l-opinjoni hija differenti. Dik hija s-saħħa tagħna. U għalhekk li mis-sħubija jgawdi kulħadd. L-Ewropa biddlet kull Stat Membru mill-2004. Imma bl-istess mod, kull Stat Membru biddel ukoll l-Ewropa. Illum magħna għandna wħud minn dawk l-individwi li kienu strumentali biex pajjiżhom jissieħeb fl-Unjoni Ewropea u li fl-istess ħin għenu biex jiktbu dan il-kapitlu straordinarju fl-istorja tal-Unjoni Ewropea. U allura f’isem il-Parlament Ewropew, il-vuċi taċ-ċittadini Ewropej, nirringrazzjakom. Napprezzaw dak kollu li intom għamiltu. Nifhmu r-responsabilità li aħna writna biex il-ħidma, l-impenn u d-determinazzjoni tagħkom ngħadduha aħna issa lill-ġenerazzjoni li jmiss ta’ mexxejja Ewropej.

Josep Borrell Fontelles,"As I was saying, it was not four or five. It was 500 – 500 designated individuals and entities are on the comprehensive sanctions against Iran. There is an arms embargo; there are missile technology and drone restrictions; there is a ban on equipment which might be used for internal repression for all material; there is another ban for monitoring telecommunications; there is, on top, sanctions targeting human rights violations. We will also expand the existing Iran-Russia Federation drone regimes in two directions, the possibility of including missiles in addition to drones, the expansion of the original dimension to be applied to the Iran-affiliated groups in the Middle East. About the Revolutionary Guard: we have already listed individuals and entities of the IRGC under the Iran human rights sanctions regime, under the territorial integrity of Ukraine sanctions regime, under the Syria sanctions regime, under the Iran weapons of mass destruction sanctions regime. Moreover, the European Union has listed the IRGC in its entirety – all, in its entirety – under the Iran weapons of mass destruction sanctions regime, which already comprises an asset freeze and a prohibition to make funds and economic resources available. In other words, listing this organisation as a terrorist organisation would have no practical effect. The addition of entities or individuals to the so-called ‘EU terrorist list’ – Common Position 931 sanctions regime – is subject to a decision by the Council by unanimity, and a national decision by the competent national authority, such as a court decision or a proscription order by an administrative authority, is a prerequisite for any additional listing.

Josep Borrell Fontelles,"Mr President, honourable Members, as Europeans we all agree that our condemnation of the attack against Israel is clear. It cannot be more clear. We have also reaffirmed our commitment to Israel’s security. We all share the urgency to avoid further escalation and to work for restraint. And this call for restraint has to be addressed both to Israel and Iran. That’s what we have done at all political levels. We will continue our diplomatic engagement with all key partners in the region. We will suspend the restrictive measures against Iran by expanding the existing – already existing, it seems that you don’t know – Iran-Russia related sanctions regime to the region. (In response to heckling from the floor) Yes, it already exists! (After consulting with the President) Sorry, but the President doesn’t want to give you the floor. The world does not need another war in the region, and the people in Gaza neither. If the whole region is at war, the war in Gaza will not stop, and everybody agrees that this war has to stop and the suffering of the people in Gaza has to stop. That’s nothing new. This has been said in all the statements of the European Union. About some concrete questions.

Everybody knows that Israel has been trying to broaden the conflict in the region to detract from their genocidal war on Gaza, and everybody knows that the EU, who for seven months of the most proportionately destructive war in history, have failed to condemn and sanction Israel, have immediately and unanimously condemned and sanctioned Iran for a disciplined retaliation which killed nobody.

We have little information on the conditions of detention of the crew, the vessel and its cargo. This is an illegal and unwanted act by the IRGC. Therefore, I would second what my colleagues have mentioned about the importance of stating that the IRGC is a terrorist organisation and sanctions should be applied forthwith. As we mark 200 days of the attack of 7 October, and after witnessing the barrage of missiles and drones launched by Iran against Israel, we must not forget the price of inaction. Mr Borrell, Iran and Hamas do not care about the lawful right of self-determination of the Palestinian people, but only the destruction of the State of Israel and of the Jewish people. That is the context. In the EU, if we want to be an honest broker in the region, we must be able to understand this. Only after stopping Iran will we be able to reach a two-state solution.

They are providing drones and missiles to kill Ukrainians, and they were the instigator of the war in Gaza, with so many casualties.

The Iranian regime is also threatening us via financing terrorism and Islamism on our continent, in our cities, in our rural areas.

Reinhard Bütikofer,"Mr President, High Representative / Vice-President, colleagues, Iran denies Israel’s legitimacy in existing; the inverse is not the case. Whoever just describes recent developments as another act in the perennial cycle of action and reaction and ignores that fundamental reality is not a voice of reason, but a voice of confusion. Unprecedented, Iran’s action is not just because it hasn’t happened before, but because it represents a new world in which authoritarian and totalitarian regimes, sometimes using their terrorist helpers, try to coordinate to undermine the international order. You said, Josep Borrell, that the EU needs to speak the language of power. Do it. Why don’t you put the IRGC on the terrorist list? You say sanctioning is not a policy. Not sanctioning is a policy.

Evin Incir,"Mr President, colleagues, I want to start by echoing the words of the Secretary-General of the UN, Mr Guterres: the region is on the edge of an abyss. The red lines are being crossed every day: unprecedented killings of civilians, media and humanitarian workers; missile attacks on other countries; foreign embassy buildings being targeted; blocking of humanitarian aid and fuel for civilians. People in the region have been suffering for a long time, and I know it very well with my own roots from the region. We do need to condemn Iran’s attacks on Israel with force, as well as condemn the attacks on a consulate building and Israel’s decision to carry out a counterattack. We need a de-escalation. De-escalation means that everyone needs to take their responsibility. We must work for de-escalation. We must work for democracy in the region, in Iran, through supporting the opposition, through supporting civil society, through putting the IRGC on the terrorist list. As well, we need to ensure an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestine, which is leading to escalation. It has done so for decades and is continuously doing it day by day.

Rasa Juknevičienė,"Mr President, dear colleagues, a few more general remarks. Why did Iran dare to attack Israel directly for the first time in history? I see two reasons: the first is deteriorating situation in Ukraine on the Eastern front and Russia’s factor, the second is the lack of political will and leadership on the Western front, Washington, DC, including. In the eyes of the terrorist alliance of dictators, the US looks weakened. That is the reason why they raise their heads and attack. This is why recent decisions in the US Congress are of existential significance. The democratic world is entering a period of political vacuum because of presidential elections in the US, European Parliament elections here in Europe. The political vacuum is a test for democracy in general and a temptation for terrorist states. However, it is not those who win this year’s elections who will be mentioned in the history books, but those who fail to defeat the terrorist Russia, Iran, North Korea and others, even though they had every chance. I still believe that we, the European Union, together with our allies, we can – that our leaders can go down in history as the ones who managed to overcome bloody regimes.",PPE,2024-04-24,"3.

Josep Borrell Fontelles,"Mr President, honourable Members, we are here to discuss the Iranians’ attack on Israel and the need for de-escalation, and our response to these events. On 13 April, Iran’s attack against Israel was unprecedented. It never happened before. It is the first time that Iran directly attacked Israel from its territory, with hundreds of drones and missiles. All this without forgetting the Israeli attack that preceded it, and we also condemned that when it happened. This aerial attack represents a major escalation of an already very tense situation in the region, where we have witnessed dangerous games of attacks and retaliations, retaliations and attacks. And I want to use the same words that United Nations Secretary-General Guterres used at the Security Council. He said, the region ‘is at the edge of an abyss’. Estamos al borde de un abismo, dijo el Secretario General. No son palabras huecas. Ciertamente, esta continua interacción bélica conduce a la región y, con ella, a todos nosotros a una situación muy peligrosa. Ahora, últimamente, parece que nos hemos movido un poco desde el borde del abismo después de que se fueran produciendo explosiones en Isfahán, Irán. Pero ninguno de los dos lados, ni Israel ni Irán, utilizó estas explosiones como un elemento nuevo de escalada. Pero este riesgo existe todavía y nuestra obligación es llamar a la contención para que la escalada no aumente el nivel de riesgo. Es una situación muy volátil, también en la frontera norte —entre Israel y Hezbolá—, donde hemos visto al Líbano otra vez en una situación muy frágil. Las Naciones Unidas advierten de que cualquier cálculo erróneo por una de las dos partes puede provocar otro conflicto. En todo caso, el nivel de intercambio de fuego en la frontera del Líbano ha alcanzado niveles que no se veían desde 2006. Los veintisiete líderes de la Unión Europea —y nosotros también en el ámbito de los ministros de Asuntos Exteriores— hemos enviado un mensaje… There is a political consensus to suspend the existing sanctions against Iran. The foreign affairs ministers in June were meeting together with the defence ministers. It took a political agreement that will be implemented in the next days. You know that to use the sanctions regime that we already have – because from time to time, people ask for something that we already have – we have a sanctions regime against Iran for providing drones to Russia. The sanctions regime can now be used to sanction the production and potential transfer of missiles from Iran to Russia – I am saying the potential transfer, but also the production itself – and also to target Iranian delivery of such weapons in the Middle East and the Red Sea region. You know what I’m talking about in the Red Sea region. We have a navy mission to try to protect the freedom of navigation. Let me add that sanctions are an important tool, and we have used them to send a clear message to Iran about the dangerous proliferation activities, aiming at the destabilisation of the region. However, I think that we have to understand that sanctions alone are not a policy. Sanctions are tools of a policy, and sanctions alone cannot deter Iran. This should be evident after years and years of international sanctions. Iran is, together with North Korea, the most sanctioned country in the world. Sanctions alone cannot solve the risk of escalation, and a place has to be given to diplomacy. Diplomatic action has to be equally important. I think this is a moment for diplomacy, to deploy maximum diplomatic efforts, to act to calm down the situation, and to ask everybody to play their part. EU Member States were in touch with key actors because the EU keeps open channels with all sides. That’s what we talked about at the G7 meeting, the ministers of foreign affairs meeting in Capri some days ago. And as you know, I am regularly in touch with the Iranian Foreign Minister in order to stress to him how deplorable are these attacks and warning that we are closer to a full regional conflict. In the past days, we also coordinated our efforts to reach out to Israel, to show restraint and to add up the Gulf countries to use their influence. We had a meeting with the ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council in Luxembourg – I think it was on Monday night, and immediately afterwards I came to Strasbourg to share with you the debate. This was an important occasion for the ministers of foreign affairs of the 27 and the ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council states to exchange about the situation in the Middle East. The spiral of attacks on counterattacks might have slowed down – that’s very good news – but the situation remains unstable and dangerous. Finally, while we pay all the necessary attention to the Iranian attack on Israel and the risk of escalation, let’s not forget what’s going on in Gaza. You listen to the news. You read the news. Gaza remains at the epicentre of the regional tensions. It’s the focus which is sending shockwaves around the region and around the world. Gaza remains at the epicentre of the regional tension, and it will be like this as long as the war continues, and more fundamentally that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not resolved. So we have to be able to build peace and stability in the region, taking into account all the conflicts that are developing there, taking into account our absolute commitment to the defence and existence of Israel, but also taking into account the high human cost of the conflicts which are raging there. The European voice has to be the voice of reason –trying to decrease the many humanitarian sufferings and look for a stable peace that, from our point of view, can only be obtained through a political process that leads to a two-state solution.

Philippe Lamberts,"Madam President, this is not a point of order. This is a point of thank you. It’s a bit emotional. It was 14 July 2009. Shortly after 8.00, I entered this hemicycle for the very first time and went to my assigned seat, 566. There I sat, almost alone, wondering at the fact that I had become a Member of the only – only – transnational parliament in the world, one of the 732 people in charge of legislating for half a billion Europeans. The pride and sense of duty that I felt there and then never, ever left me for the last 15 years. Back then, I told my voters and the members of my party that I would seek two or maximum three terms in this House. They granted me my wish, and I will forever be thankful to them for their trust. But three terms are not four; now is the time to leave. At this moment, I want to thank you, my present and former colleagues, for those 15 years. They’ve been, frankly, the brightest part of my professional career. For sure, we were not always on the same side of the argument, but I would say that, by and large, our debates were worthy of a vibrant democracy. I am also thankful to the staff of this institution. They make sure that we have everything it takes to discharge our duties to the benefit of all citizens. It would be my pleasure – because it’s not just thank you, it’s an invitation – it would be my pleasure to see you tonight at 20.00 in la rotonde, to share drinks together to celebrate my departure and that of so many other MEPs who don’t have the chance to speak. Thank you for your respect. But, if I may, before leaving, I just want you to allow me a few share to share a few thoughts on the way forward. Thank you for your respect! As we could see, the European Union was built as a response to two totalitarianisms: Nazism and Soviet communism. Those had in common an utter contempt for the life and dignity of human beings. It is not by chance that the first value lying at the foundation of this Union is human dignity. This has to remain our common compass; everything we do here must contribute to the possibility for every human being, present and to come, to live a dignified life. Nowadays, dictatorships and authoritarian regimes are once again on the rise, including at our own borders. At the same time, we see clear and present danger to human dignity within our Union. And at the global level, climate change reminds us that our economic system is putting the lives and livelihoods of humanity as a whole at risk. (Objections from certain quarters) I’m finishing! Be patient. In 15 years, I’ve never made a point of order, right? Never once. So allow me to finish. The challenges ahead are daunting, but I have an unwavering faith in the collective wisdom, creativity and resources of the European citizens. If human dignity is our compass, the motto of our European Union provides the key to unlock these collective capabilities: unity. Because together we only represent 6 % of the global population and we live on just 2 % of the land. This alone should remind us that only if we act together, will we be able to have a grip on our present and our future, what everyone here calls sovereignty. Divided, we are bound to become the playthings of others, of our events beyond our control. Diversity. Because no single individual, no single group of people, no single discipline, no single school of thought, no single culture alone can grasp the complexity of our world. It is only when we look at it from different perspectives that we stand a chance of making it better. (Loud protests from certain quarters) Dear colleagues, I’m finishing. One sentence.

Hannah Neumann,"Mr President, Mr Borrell, last week, the Iranian regime celebrated its first direct strike on Israel, and it continuously violates vital provisions of the nuclear agreement. ‘Sit and wait’ is no option and more diplomacy alone will not be enough. We urgently need to work on a plan B: a regional security architecture which addresses the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and preparedness for new attacks by the Iranian regime. Frankly said, what more does this regime have to do until you finally wake up to the harsh realities? The IRGC is a terror organisation and it should be designated as such. The drones and missiles attacking Israel and our ships in the Red Sea are manufactured in Iran, and we should have sanctioned all those involved in that months ago. Last but not least, the regime is not legitimately representing the people of Iran, and you should stop pretending it would. All these demands are included in our joint resolutions and we expect you to finally implement them. Dear colleagues, the Middle East today is just a dangerous miscalculation away from an all-out war. It is on everyone – everyone – to stop repression and work towards de-escalation. And there are so many in the region who want nothing more than peace and an end to the suffering: babies being born orphans after airstrikes; families living in horror whilst seeking refuge from bombs night after night; tormented hostages unable to hear the voices of their loved ones; and so much more. There are strongmen on all sides – Hamas, Houthis, Hezbollah – in Israel as well as in Iran that benefit from the recent escalation. It is our collective responsibility, together with the US and regional actors, to move from this deadly balance of deterrence towards a peace-seeking balance of humanity, dear colleagues.",Greens/EFA,2024-04-24,"3.

Virginijus Sinkevičius,"Madam President, honourable Members, let me begin by sincerely thanking everyone involved and in particular the lead rapporteur, Ms Ries, with her shadow rapporteurs, as well as the rapporteurs in the three associated committees. The text of the new packaging and packaging waste regulations represents a balanced package of measures. This outcome of negotiations will contribute significantly to reducing packaging waste and promoting the transition to a circular economy in the European Union. It will also largely harmonise the conditions for placing packaging on the EU market. Naturally, in view of the broad scope of application of this legal act, there will be a need for follow up work to ensure its smooth and pragmatic implementation in the interests of the public authorities, operators and citizens. Let me be very clear that the Commission stands ready to make every effort to support the implementation of the rules agreed by the co-legislators and ensure that they deliver economic and environmental benefits on the ground. In the past weeks, specific concerns about the economic constraints and environmental issues were brought to our attention regarding the reuse targets for transport packaging. These concerns are related to the feasibility of achieving a 100 % reuse of pallet wrappings and straps – and indeed, based on the impact assessment carried out, the Commission did not include such a requirement in its proposal. In the light of the concerns and calls for action, I confirm that the Commission will launch an assessment of this issue by the end of this year, and address it as a matter of priority upon the entry into force of the regulation. To this aim, the Commission will adopt, without any delay, a delegated act to exempt plastic pallet wrapping and straps from the scope of paragraph 2 and paragraph 3 of Article 29, provided the assessment concludes that the conditions laid down in paragraph 18 thereof are fulfilled. So, to conclude, the replacement of the old directive by a modern regulation with predictable, meaningful and harmonised rules is urgently needed in the interest of the environment, but also for the EU economy and internal market.",-,2024-04-24,7.5.

Mairead McGuinness,"You heard it first in the European Parliament as Gaeilge! Go raibh míle maith agat, Sheáin. Thank you all for your contributions. This is a really serious debate and all of you who have contributed are very serious players in this Parliament, and your work reflects that. But, of course, the next step is to implement and certainly, from our point of view in the Commission, we are already working with the European Banking Authority on the many technical standards and measures required to see effective implementation. To the reference from my former colleague, Markus Ferber – just to recall that the Commission will continue to monitor the implementation of the final Basel III standards in other major jurisdictions, and in the area of market risk, the Commission is empowered to address level playing field issues by adopting delegated acts, if needed. On the overall framework, our long transitional arrangements and phasing provisions give us time to adapt to international developments. Beyond the current uncertainty on the international front, we are confident that the final elements of Basel III will be implemented globally. Just to note that the Basel Committee celebrates its 50th anniversary this year, and it does continue to be instrumental for international cooperation on bank supervision and regulation – and it is in the interest of banks themselves that consistent rules are applied globally. It is in the European interest to finalise implementation of these international standards. Yes, it will require a lot of effort from banks, their supervisors and all related stakeholders. But one thing is very clear: Basel will be implemented. My thanks again to this House and in particular to Rapporteur Jonás Fernández and the shadow rapporteurs. Together we are providing regulatory stability to our banking system, ensuring its resilience and its continued ability to serve citizens and businesses. Looking ahead to the next mandate, I note and welcome that this House has just adopted its position on the review of the crisis management and deposit insurance framework. The CMDI reform will further preserve financial stability and protect taxpayers and depositors. It also takes due account of the specificities in the national banking sectors while maintaining a level playing field. I’m confident that an agreement on this reform early in the next mandate will open the way to completing the banking union, including a European deposit insurance scheme. After almost 10 years of stalemate on this topic, we are happy to see that the European Parliament is ready to move forward, while the Commission reserves its position at this stage. Ambitious reforms on banking union, as well as on capital markets union, will bolster the EU’s financial stability and competitiveness. I would issue a warning here that the status quo will not deliver for the Europe of the future. We need funding to invest in the green and digital transition, and, therefore, we need work on capital markets union and banking union. To quote the long-serving (25 years) First Vice-President of the European Parliament, Othmar Karas, ‘let us not play national interests against Europe. Let us be more decisive, more ambitious.’ I just recall that we had marked 30 years of the single market last year, and yet we have failed to deliver a single market for capital, which means that we have an opportunity – and let’s grasp that opportunity. I hope that voters ask questions about this. It is not a remote topic. It is about their very lives and livelihoods, and they should know what’s happening or, indeed, what’s not happening. So I thank you for this debate. I think we have done good work together, but, of course, we will have to implement. I can guarantee from the Commission’s perspective that we will implement faithfully and effectively.",-,2024-04-24,"11.

Mairead McGuinness,"Mr President, I’m conscious of the time constraints, so just to appreciate the debate that we’ve had. From our side in the Commission, the next step is to make sure we have effective implementation of what we’ve agreed, particularly in setting up the new Anti-Money Laundering Authority. It needs to be adequately staffed and established so that it can do its work. I’m glad I was quoted by my colleague to my left, who’s on his left, in relation to cash, and can I just dismiss this idea that is being put out in this Chamber by a very few, that we are doing anything to restrict the right of access to cash? If anything, the European Commission is insisting on the right of citizens to use cash. But, of course, I think all citizens want to make sure that the cash we used is not dirty money, and we have strong support for that in this House. So I will just finish by saying it was a real privilege to work on this package. It was enormously difficult to get it to where it is today, and we will have to see the fruits of it, and I hope the next Parliament continues to monitor all aspects of our anti-money laundering. And to the question raised by Seán Kelly – the truth is in this area, Seán, we will never finish our work because the criminals, the elites, those with deep pockets, will find ways of trying to evade our laws – and it is up to you and this Commission and the Council to keep ahead of them.

Mick Wallace,"Mr President, the EU proposals for an Anti-Money Laundering Regulation need further scrutiny and should not be adopted. The regulation proposes an EU-wide limit for cash payments in commercial transactions to be set at EUR 10 000. Commissioner, you said the proposed measures would mean that funeral services above EUR 10 000 would have to be paid for through card or via a bank. A lot of people I know still use cash, including myself, and penalising them for using over EUR 10 000 for something like a funeral seems draconian and hardly proportionate. The regulation also seems totally at odds with the Commission’s proposal in 2023 to protect cash, which stated that the proposal will ensure that everyone in the euro area is free to choose their preferred payment method and has access to basic cash services. It will ensure the financial inclusion of vulnerable groups, who tend to rely more on cash payments, such as older people. You say, Commissioner, that they are targeting illegal activity, but you know that successive Irish governments have refused to tackle the illegal financial activity of NAMA, the biggest financial scandal in Ireland’s history. Will big corruption still be ok or are things going to change? (End of catch-the-eye procedure)",The Left,2024-04-24,12.

Seán Kelly,"A Uachtaráin, money laundering is a terrible crime because, it has been said, it finances the worst people in the world – criminals of all sorts, Russians, people smugglers, drug barons, you name it – and using legitimate businesses to so do. So, if we did nothing else in this mandate, we will be doing a great service to our citizens in Europe if we could at least limit hugely the opportunity for money laundering. The fact that it costs us 1 % of GDP per year – that is almost equal to the entire EU budget. And I think the rapporteurs who worked on this for the last couple of years have huge credit, as does the Commissioner, Mairead McGuinness, and others. Looking at where the loopholes are and eliminating them and putting a maximum of EUR 10 000 in cash seems to me to be very sensible. So my question to Mairead is: how confident can we be that that 1 % is reduced by 50 % or 60 %, and when will we say that our work is done, no more money laundering?",PPE,2024-04-24,12.

Mairead McGuinness,"Mr President, thank you, I think today really marks a very significant moment for the European Union’s ongoing fight against money laundering and terrorism financing. And yet, I look to the galleries and I’m glad to see there are citizens listening to this debate, because this matters to you, your family and your society. And I hope you’ve listened to the colleagues who have already contributed, because this has been an enormous effort, because we were all focused on doing the right thing and doing it in a timely way. I want to thank the co-legislators and I want to list you in the order in which you have spoken: Luděk Niedermayer, Paul Tang, Eero Heinäluoma, Damien Carême, Eva Poptcheva and Emil Radev, the final speaker. I hold you all in equal esteem for the fact that you worked so well together and that we’ve arrived at this moment. I also thank the negotiating teams in ECON and LIBE, the chairs of ECON, Irene Tinagli, and of LIBE, Juan Ferdnando López Aguilar, and of course the presidencies: the Czech, the Swedish, the Spanish and finally the Belgian Presidency that got this over the line with you. When we started this effort, we knew it was not going to be easy, but there was an absolute imperative to improve significantly on the current situation. The scale of these reforms is unprecedented and the changes – the very necessary changes – we proposed are an ambitious departure from the status quo. I’ve said that we did our work in a timely and effective manner, and this was a priority for Parliament, Council and the Commission. So we did our work. So thank you for making sure we close this mandate with a reform that is truly transformative of Europe’s regulatory and interinstitutional setup, where we tackle money laundering and terrorism financing, because dirty money finances terrible crimes. And they’ve been listed already by colleagues: drug trafficking, human trafficking, prostitution, terrorism. And I want to now briefly note how broad the scope is of this package. So from cash to crypto, from real estate to luxury goods and football clubs, we are targeting all areas where there is a real risk of illegal activity. The private sector will benefit from common EU rules, including on the sharing of information. National authorities will be able to cooperate with each other and to investigate suspicious activities and we have a new anti-money laundering authority with very broad powers, specifically to guarantee consistent application of the rules across the single market, to support early detection of suspicious cases and report to law enforcement to supervise the highest risk entities directly. And the reform benefits other areas of policy. Most obviously, it benefits our work together on sanctions. There are new provisions on implementing sanctions, on mitigating the risks of sanctions evasion and on strengthening cooperation between AML and sanctions authorities. So I think, overall, this demonstrates the EU delivering to our financial system, our economy and the security of our citizens. So once again, my deepest gratitude for this work and I look forward to hearing the rest of the debate.",-,2024-04-24,12.

Paul Tang,"Mr President, dear Commissioner and her team, dear colleagues, today marks a pivotal moment in our collective efforts to fight dirty money and bolster financial integrity in the European economy. As we stand on the brink of voting on a groundbreaking legislative package, I am humbled and proud to have been part of the negotiations that have led us to this pivotal moment. I want to thank dear co-rapporteurs Luděk Niedermayer, Eva Poptcheva, Emil Radev, Eero Heinäluoma and Damien Carême. The scandals that tarnished our financial systems in recent years – think of Danske Bank to the Cyprus Confidential files – served as stark reminders for the negotiators to act decisively and move forward. And yet we had to witness another scandal of incredible scale when Putin invaded Ukraine and Russian oligarchs massively flew and drove their private jets, sports cars and super yachts outside the EU. This added up to the already existing urgent need – often voiced by the European Parliament – to address the fragmented and poorly coordinated national rules that have allowed nefarious actors to exploit regulatory gaps and evade detection. It is a pivotal moment for two reasons. First, the package is more European, more coordinated than ever before and this is needed since national borders do not deter, but even help criminals and terrorists. The new authority is a strong symbol for European coordination, but also the first AML regulation underlines this approach. Second, the package is more targeted than before. Parliament’s efforts have paid off: the registration of high-value assets like cars, boats and planes; the single access point for real estate and land; the vigilance for high net-worth, high-risk individuals and so on. As proud as we are of this result, we must recognise, as Luděk Niedermayer emphasised already, that the fight against money laundering is ongoing and ever evolving. There is still work to do. First, on access to the BO register: the directive lays down the principles for access requiring easy access for those with a legitimate interest and introducing mutual recognition. Yet the current situation is chaotic at best and hampers access for journalists, researchers and NGOs. Their access needs to be restored as soon as possible and I call on the Member States to restore access as soon as. Get it done, now! Don’t wait for the legislation! Second, in Parliament I have worked intensively on fighting both tax evasion and money laundering. I have always found it very confusing that despite all the similarities – similar constructions, similar actors – there are two different silos of institutions and legislations. This is confusing but also ineffective. So I call on the Commission to eradicate the barriers between the two silos and have a more integrated approach. The Commission can start with ensuring the exchange of data and information among the institutions, like FIUs and tax administrations. In the modern economy, data and information are becoming more and more important and this holds especially for the fight against tax evasion and money laundering. Please Commission, get started. As we prepare to cast our votes, let us do so with the knowledge that we are enacting meaningful change this week, not just for ourselves, but for future generations of Europeans. Let us stand firm in our resolve to uphold the values of transparency, integrity and justice that lie at these proposals but also at the heart of the European Union.",S&D,2024-04-24,12.

Luděk Niedermayer,"Mr President, I guess this long speaking time is reflecting the hundreds of hours we spent on the anti-money-laundering file. But I hope I will not use all the four minutes. Let me start by saying that that money laundering, financing of terrorism is a very serious crime. This is something that is at the end of the criminal behaviour, but at the same time, ease with which money can be laundered is also stimulating the crime. Fighting money laundering is a continuous process because criminals are all the time trying to find a better way how to do it. So that’s why we have already six evolution of Anti-Money Laundering Directive and we are still trying to close the loopholes and make the system better. This time I’m grateful that the Commission had made some systemic changes. This change consists of, first, dividing the directive between the directive and the regulation, and at the same time creating the AMLA body that will oversee the quality of the anti-money laundering framework. It took more than two years. During that time the word has changed. We witnessed a terrible Russian attack on Ukraine and it has also some financial consequences. We try to find out where the assets of criminals sanctioned people are, and we found that it’s not easy. So this was another impact to our work. And I’m grateful the Commission accepts the fact that that we want more than was originally proposed. So what did we did do in file I was responsible for? Inter alia, we accept that we are living in the digital age, so we must make sure that the data are used digitally and exchange in a readable form that will make the fight against money laundering easier and more effective. We look very much at real estate, because the system in some countries are, I don’t want to say from the Middle Ages, but definitely are not up to the current situation. And we made a significant improvement. We are aiming to improve the quality data for beneficial ownership. Parliament was proposing to create the registers for planes, boats or similar assets, but we end up after the agreement with the Council with so-called threshold-based reporting that will look after ability to identify who owns such data. We also tried to improve the interaction between competent authorities and oblige entities, but making sure, for example, how quickly they will react on the suspicious transaction report. We also harmonised the sanctions, and this is just a short list of what we did. So I hope the system will improve the situation. I hope the system will close some loopholes and make sure that the weakest point of the anti-money-laundering system will become stronger. So let me, finally, thank the Commission for being responsive to the demands of Parliament. Let me thank the Council and especially the Belgian Presidency, who did a very good job in finalising the agreement. That would not be possible without really very great and very intense work of our people, our teams and EP staff. I hope that this file will get the support because I believe it deserves it.",PPE,2024-04-24,12.

Virginijus Sinkevičius,"Mr President, honourable Members, thank you very much for this debate, which is very timely ahead of the European elections. Let me use this opportunity and address at least some of the more concrete issues you raised during this debate. First of all, as regards Ms Bentele, Mr Canfin, Mr Liese, you all said, and it is absolutely true, that the most of the Green Deal legislation was approved in this House by a large majority. The Green Deal achievements of this mandate are our joint achievements, and we should say this loudly and clearly. But the reality is that there are also important pieces in this puzzle still missing, and without these pieces, like the Nature Restoration Law, we will miss crucial tools to meet the binding targets we have jointly agreed and subscribed in the EU Climate Law. We would discard an indispensable instrument that can help us becoming more resilient towards the devastating effects of climate change. So I therefore urge Member States to now fully take their responsibility and get this law over the finishing line. Unfortunately, many interventions today show that we still tend to overlook the value of nature. Let me recall some additional figures and facts. In 2019, the economic value provided by the wider set of ecosystem services in the EU amounted to EUR 243 billion. The UN calculated that losing the benefits provided by the healthy ecosystems could cause a decline in global GDP of USD 2.7 trillion annually by 2030. And finally, the European Central Bank points out that nearly 75% of all bank loans in the euro area go to companies that are highly dependent on at least one ecosystem service, and severe losses of functionality in those ecosystems would cause critical problems for those companies. No, climate and biodiversity policies are not a threat to our economies, but quite on the contrary, the cost of clean-up, for example, of the Slovenian floods, stands at over 16% of Slovenian GDP: 16%! So more than a tenth of what Slovenians earn altogether had to go to clean up damages of the event that may well be repeated. These are concrete reminders of the costs at stake. These are real figures, and behind these figures there are these are real people whose lives are affected. Let me also say a few words on farming because this is also extremely important. But listening to claims that farmers were protesting against the Green Deal means not listening to farmers demands, because if you look concretely at what farmers asked, there were demands concretely going as regards the common agricultural policy and Gaia-X implementation and trade measures, which if we implement the Green Deal and if we ensure that the Green Deal is implemented outside the EU, the farmers will have a level playing field. When it comes to CAP, let’s not forget that the CAP, which was finalised in this mandate, was proposed by the previous Commission, so it is way behind the Green Deal was actually introduced. Let’s be clear. Let’s listen to our farmers demands, and try to implement the exact steps needed so that they would be competitive, that they would receive a fair price for their hard work. That’s the core of the Green Deal. The Green Deal does not go against the farmers’ interest. On the contrary, if there is no clean water, if the ecosystem is degraded and the soil is not fertile, we won’t have any farmers, and that would be the biggest disaster. Dear Members of the Parliament, once again, thank you very much for this encouraging debate. The last European Council adopted extremely important points on supporting Europe’s competitiveness. Nevertheless, the Green Deal is recognised that it ensures competitiveness of EU industry and increases Europe’s energy independence and resilience. So the Commission looks forward to continuing cooperation with the European Parliament and all its Members, both in this mandate and the new one to come, because we are committed to finding the best solution for European citizens and European businesses.",-,2024-04-24,10.

Seán Kelly,"Mr President, during the economic crisis, we heard phrases like ‘banks too big to fail’, and they did fail and they failed everybody. But thankfully, as a result of the measures taken here at European Parliament level and Commission, we don’t hear that anymore. We now have more resilient banks, and thankfully they’re not going bust, and people aren’t going bust as a result. We have made progress, which is good, and today we are celebrating that. But I think the point made by my good friend Othmar Karas when he says the lack of a completed banking union and the lack of a capital markets union is costing us EUR 470 billion per year, and if the Council is the problem, then in the next mandate, we have got to, as they say in America, ‘kick ass’ to ensure that it actually happens, because we need the investments, especially if we are to complete the Green Deal, if we have investments in renewable energy, retrofitting of buildings, etc. So I think a wake-up call today for the Council: Parliament and the next Commission are going to come after you.

Virginijus Sinkevičius,"Mr President, State Secretary, honourable Members, the European Green Deal was originally designed as a growth and innovation strategy from the start and it continues to be an essential driver for securing lasting prosperity. We remain committed to our climate and environmental objectives, because becoming more resource-efficient and energy-independent makes Europe stronger in the face of geopolitical tensions and challenges, such as energy market volatility, while preserving the results of decades of social development. Individual citizens and communities are increasingly exposed to natural disasters and health risks and energy prices have soared because we were too dependent on energy from important fossil fuels. Therefore, slowing down our efforts is not an option, as the cost of inaction would be disproportionately high compared to the investments needed to act. The figures prove this: the EU reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 32.5 % in 2022 compared with 1990, while its gross domestic product grew by 67 % over the same period. Environmental policies have been wrongly portrayed as exacerbating social divisions and leading to decreased EU competitiveness. However, the transition to sustainability and trying in the European Green Deal remains the only viable response to the undeniable reality – and this reality is that extreme weather events resulting from intensifying climate change, critical changes in Earth systems, pollution and degradation of natural ecosystems pose significant risks to our well-being. This assessment comes straight from the business community and it is supported by the annual risk report of the World Economic Forum. We also have strong support from citizens. According to the 2023 Eurobarometer, 93 % of Europeans believe climate change is a serious problem facing the world and over half think that the transition to a green economy should be sped up. Doing nothing and waiting is not an option. The cost of inaction would be simply too high. And according to the climate risk assessment, a conservative estimate is that climate change-related impacts could reduce EU GDP by about 7 % by the end of the century. What about biodiversity? Biodiversity loss is one of the biggest threats to agricultural production and food security and it also affects climate, our health and water security. Nature is our first ally and nature-based solutions are the most efficient way to face the increasing risk from climate change. And they are very cost-efficient solutions. From the beginning of this mandate, the European Green Deal has tackled the interlinked risks of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. It has set in motion the transformation of our society and economy to make it more modern, resource-efficient, climate neutral, resilient, prosperous and competitive. Honourable Members, the handprint and contribution of the European Parliament to the vision and concrete legislation of the European Green Deal has been of utmost importance. The set of policies and regulation adopted over the last four and a half years provide clarity on the direction of travel for the EU’s green transition. We hear prominent European industries and companies are making strong calls to strengthen the industrial dimension of the European Green Deal and better promote industrial competitiveness. The Commission agrees. Climate neutrality by 2050, increased competitiveness and resilience of our industry and a transition that is socially fair and inclusive go hand in hand. The economy and the environment cannot be disconnected one from the other and we need robust productivity to ensure public services can be financed. Competitiveness, sustainability and social support go together. We are fully committed to supporting citizens and businesses in this transition. The recent simplification proposal in implementing the Common Agricultural Policy, or the ongoing work to reduce the administrative burden of companies, are examples of how we support the implementation in light of evolving circumstances. We also work together with Member States to support them in addressing skills gaps, ensuring people have the skills required for the new technologies. Implementation is the key word for the next years. The first fruits of EU actions are already visible, for example, the value of the EU’s net-zero start-ups ecosystem in 2021 is over EUR 100 billion, doubling since 2020. Renewables provide 45 % of our power in 2023. Over 1.5 million electric vehicles were sold in the EU in 2023. The EU budget 2021-2027, including both the Multiannual Financial Framework and the NextGenerationEU instrument, are currently projected to contribute almost EUR 600 billion to climate action and 7.5 % of the EU budget in 2024 and 10 % in 2026 and 2027. They are also dedicated to biodiversity objectives. At the same time, we will continue to develop strong partnership with like-minded partners while ensuring security of our energy systems and supply chains and reducing external dependencies. We need to listen. We need to talk to each other. We need to avoid polarisation that creates divisions amongst us. We may not convince each other on all points, but we need to cooperate sincerely and find compromises that take us forward. European citizens, they ask that their politicians take a longer-term perspective, while ensuring the competitiveness of European economy and supporting the vulnerable groups within society.

Mathieu Michel,"Monsieur le Président, Monsieur le Commissaire, chers membres de cette Assemblée, merci pour ce débat vraiment riche en observations et en commentaires. Évidemment, j’ai pris note, au nom du Conseil, de l’ensemble des commentaires. Je voudrais, puisque nous avons été sollicités sur l’évolution du travail sur la loi sur la restauration de la nature, vous confirmer que le règlement sur la restauration de la nature doit chercher un équilibre entre la restauration des écosystèmes agricoles et les intérêts des agriculteurs. L’article 9 a été rédigé avec soin, afin de garantir que le respect du règlement repose sur les efforts déployés, et non nécessairement sur les résultats obtenus. Permettez-moi de vous assurer que la présidence déploie tous ses efforts pour permettre l’adoption de ce texte législatif crucial. Ladies and gentlemen, at the end of this legislature, it has become clear that we were wise in embarking on a historic green and fair transition, including an extensive road map of actions that aim to make the EU carbon neutral by 2050. It is equally clear that our Green Deal should be complemented with an industrial deal and a renewed commitment to our competitiveness. But these are not actually mutually exclusive ambitions. They cannot and should not be. We need a clear path to decarbonise the industry in a way that brings predictable and competitive conditions for our companies and that creates jobs. This week, this Parliament will vote on a host of legislation that further cements our commitment to a Green Deal, including reducing packaging waste, microplastic pollution, water pollutants and improving ambient air quality. Crucially, this Parliament will vote on the Net-Zero Industry Act, which is set to bolster EU production in green technologies. The law will simplify the permitting process, setting maximum timelines for projects to be authorised depending on their scope and output. The quality of our legislation can and will make a huge difference, as well as a firm financial basis from both public and private sources. We must move away from a climate of polarisation in which we pit industry against nature, but also agriculture against nature or agriculture against industry. In terms of agricultural policy, Europe has the levers to upgrade the position of farmers to focus on innovation and invest in more sustainable sustainability. We can overcome the contradictions that are put to us. We can be a continent where there is room for nature that is rapidly decarbonising with profitable and prosperous agriculture and industry. That must remain our collective ambition as we approach a new legislature. In short, I can therefore assure you of the Council’s continued commitment to the objectives of the green transition and that the Council will continue to pursue work on current files.",-,2024-04-24,10.

Mairead McGuinness,"Mr President, colleagues, I just want to recall, before I go into my official remarks, that it is quite fitting that this debate is happening at the end of this mandate. It was a topic – Basel implementation – at my hearing in October 2020. So we’ve delivered, and we’ve delivered together – just to mark that. I certainly will not forget the challenge of delivering, but also the opportunity it provides. I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Fernandez, who has just resumed his seat, and the many colleagues in the Chamber who have contributed to getting this agreement in place. It is a significant milestone that we have political agreement on the banking package, and it is a huge achievement for the European Union. Just to recall that this allows for the implementation of the final elements of the Basel III reforms, completing the banking reforms which started after the 2018 global financial crisis. I think many of us – I hope all of us – remember the immense difficulties caused by that crisis. We should never forget the horrific implications for our countries, our society and our citizens. Some have never fully recovered. Our economies came close to collapse. A number of financial institutions failed or had to be bailed out by taxpayers. Many people lost their homes and their livelihoods. The Basel reforms are about fixing the problems in the banking system that contributed to that catastrophe. Now to the specifics of what we are discussing today. The main goal in finalising the implementation of Basel III is to restore confidence in risk-based capital requirements. In other words, our rules should make sure that banks hold capital in proportion to the risks of their activities. We stayed faithful to the Basel agreement, showing our commitment to international regulatory cooperation. We did use the flexibility within Basel to make some targeted adjustments to reflect the characteristics of the EU economy and banking sector. EU banks are especially important for lending to corporates and providing mortgages to homeowners, so there are transitional arrangements for activities like these. We’ve also avoided unnecessary burdens for small banks. The EU applies these rules to all of our 4 500 banks, and not just to the large and internationally active banks. We have ensured that there is no significant increase in overall capital requirements. So the result of our work is a balanced compromise, which keeps our banks resilient and competitive. This banking package will make our banks more resilient to future economic shocks and ensure banks can continue to fund the EU economy, including in times of crisis. So, again, my appreciation and thanks to Parliament for your very significant contribution to this ambitious outcome. Parliament’s negotiating team – in particular rapporteur Jonás Fernández and the shadow rapporteurs – deserve, and have, our appreciation. I do recall seeing Othmar Karas in the Chamber. Ah! ‘He’s behind you’, as they say at the pantomime. Just a word for Othmar, if I may – and I’m sure colleagues will not be upset if I mention Othmar, as a colleague, a friend, and a very significant parliamentarian, who has made a huge contribution to banking regulation over the last 25 years in this House. I think your work is hugely appreciated and, indeed, the way you go about your work is, I think, an example for new Members. We all together have done our work, and I think now is not the time to rest. We have to implement, and this is the next stage of that process. The Commission will also take the co-legislators’ mandate to review the single market for banking very seriously. So to that end, I want to make the following very clear statement. The Commission undertakes to carry out a fair and balanced assessment of the state of the single market for banking, taking into consideration, in particular, prudential requirements, including the level of application of the output floor, and the provisions on the waiver of capital and liquidity requirements. It will carry out this mandate based on inputs from the European Banking Authority, and from the European Central Bank and the Single Supervisory Mechanism, and will consult with interested parties to ensure that the various perspectives are appropriately considered. The Commission will, where appropriate, present a legislative proposal based on the report. So I think it is appropriate, as this Parliament concludes its five-year mandate, that we are debating financial regulation, because this is not a dry, disconnected debate about percentages and risk-based. This is core to the wellbeing of our society and our economy. And I will recall the votes on EDIS and CMDI. I’ll mention them further in my concluding remarks. You have done a lot of work in this mandate to move the process of banking union, and indeed, I hope, capital markets union a step forward. I look forward to hearing your views.",-,2024-04-24,"11.

Frances Fitzgerald,"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your work. Almost 12 years ago to the day, 25 April 2012, the then ECB President stood in front of this House and called for the long overdue integration of European banking policy – in short, banking union. We are 12 years on and we have made great strides, but our banking union is missing its third pillar. This week we’re finalising our position on the updated crisis management framework. Last week, the ECON Committee finally supported a proposal for an initial European deposit insurance scheme. Time is no longer a luxury if we want to show that European economic integration can indeed provide the conditions for a stable and innovative banking industry. While we have reduced the risk, many of the problems we face 12 years ago are still with us. Bank debt and sovereign debt are still too closely intertwined in some countries. A European approach would bring more competition and better value for people. It would make a real difference in the lives of our citizens, and that is what is important. We need to complete the banking union. In the end, we only regret the chances we didn’t take. Catch-the-eye procedure",PPE,2024-04-24,"11.

Bas Eickhout,"Mr President, thank you. And also, thank you for the applause before I even spoke. Last Monday, this Monday, it was Earth Day 2024, and also, again, the European State of the Climate Report has been published and it is full of very clear messages: 2023 was the warmest year on record; again, the average sea surface temperature across Europe was the highest on record; the Alps, which have seen glaciers lose around 10% of their remaining volume; and in the past 20 years, heat-related deaths are estimated to have increased by 94%. Weather- and climate-related economic losses in 2023 are estimated at more than EUR 13.4 billion. That’s the state of the climate, and we’re only at the beginning because every emission that we are still doing is piling up in this atmosphere and is building up impacts that we are still going to see. Remember 2015, when we signed up to the Paris Agreement, where we promised the world, ‘We want to stay below a warming of 1.5 degrees’? Remember 2019, when this whole House said, ‘We support the Green Deal. We work for climate neutrality’? Remember 2020, when this House in a full majority said, ‘There is a state of climate emergency’? Those were the days. Those were the days where also the conservatives were very clear, making the point, ‘We need urgent action on climate’, and what have we seen? We’ve seen stalling. We’ve seen pressuring. We’ve been watering down: on nature restoration, on deforestation, on pesticides, on packaging, on electric vehicles. On all these files, we have seen conservatives and the right weakening, pressuring down and watering down legislation. And they are giving false promises. This afternoon we will vote on agriculture again, and here the right will say, ‘We are going to weaken your environmental provisions because then everything will be fine for you’. But is that what is the problem of our farmers? The problem of our farmers is not environmental legislation. It is that they’re not getting a fair price for their production. So I will challenge you. We have amendments this afternoon where we are going to ask for transparency in the food chain so that we know what farmers can get. We have amendments that are capping the subsidies so that our subsidy system will not go to the big farms, but to the small farmers. We are challenging you. Are you willing to really pick up a fight for our farmers, or are you just making sound and not helping any farmer at all? And we will see the same on industrial policy. In industrial policy, the right is talking about the problems of competitiveness. What are the real problems? The real problem is a lack of a European strategy, a lack of European investments, and a lack of clarity that the Green Deal is our future industrial deal. That clarity, that is lacking. So therefore, dear colleagues, these elections will be about the Green Deal, the future of the Green Deal, the future of European competitiveness, the future of a real fair income for our farmers. And therefore we are calling, ‘Let’s make these elections the Green Deal elections’, and let’s make sure that we are continuing our fight because we need to pick it up. And it is time that the right is getting his head out of the sand again and start working. We will do so.",Greens/EFA,2024-04-24,10.

Johan Van Overtveldt,"Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, thank you. Let me first express my surprise at the title of this debate because Basel III, as such, has nothing to do with the European Banking Union. You can have a European Banking Union with or without Basel III, and you can have Basel III with or without a European Banking Union. That being said, basically, for Basel III is that banks should have sufficient capacity to absorb shocks and continue lending. It is therefore of the greatest interest of the EU and its banking sector to be fully compliant with Basel III. The European Banking Authority has estimated the impact of the watered down CRR text that we will vote later on, and that is substantially below pure Basel standards. Unfortunately, the deviations from Basel III leave significant risk uncovered and on an international level, the EU might end up as the sole large jurisdiction with a watered down Basel implementation. That will not only negatively affect the reputation and the credibility of both EU banks and supervisors, but will also lead to higher financial stability risks for the entire EU economy, higher funding costs for the banks and a weakened influence in global standard setting bodies.",ECR,2024-04-24,"11.

Michael Gahler,"Madam President, colleagues, Commissioner, if I had five minutes speaking time, we would indeed repeat one by one your speech because I fully subscribed to what you have said and you have said it all. Indeed, there are obligations that the Georgian Government has undertaken and which they are blatantly violating by introducing this law. Well, actually, my impression is if it is about foreign agents, the only foreign agents that are involved in this is those in the ruling party, who copy Russian laws and are promoting the way Russia rules at home, and perhaps even on behalf of that. And if I look at the Prime Minister, Kobakhidze, some time ago, they were still with the S&D group and were there complimented out for right reasons. But, in the meanwhile, he will be going to Budapest to a very right-wing conference and appear there as a speaker together with Mr Wilders and others. So I really wonder where this country is heading and where this ruling party is heading. We support the will of the people. We are in full solidarity with those protesters with Georgian and European flags, and apart from that, we once again also demand the release of Mr Saakashvili and also to see to it that we can get hold of Mr Ivanishvili and sanction him because he is the one in the background who is actually guiding the agenda there.",PPE,2024-04-23,14.

The actions of the Georgian Government show that it is not taking seriously its ambition to join the European Union.

Miriam Lexmann,"Madam President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, the governing Georgian Dream party has once again reintroduced the act on agents of foreign influence. The plain fact is that this law, currently in the Georgian Parliament, is the same text withdrawn because it violated Commission recommendations on Georgia’s candidate status. It is the same text modelled on that one of Putin’s Russia. Rather than strengthening transparency and the fight against the malign influence of Kremlin and other authoritarian regimes, the proposed law will undermine the work of civil society and independent media. Should this law be adopted against the aspirations of Georgian people, and in violation of the Commission recommendations, then our response should be clear. First, we must freeze any opening of accession negotiations of Georgia. Second, any future financial assistance to Georgia must be made conditional on scrapping this damaging law.

Janez Lenarčič,"Madam President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, over the past weeks, thousands of citizens of Georgia have taken to the streets to exercise their right to peaceful demonstration, demanding once again that authorities withdraw the law on transparency of foreign influence. We have seen impressive scenes from Georgia last year already: citizens of all ages holding Georgian and European flags, showing their strong attachment to democracy, to our shared European values and to Georgia’s path towards the European Union. At the time, the ruling party and the government made a public pledge to the Georgian citizens that such legislation would never come back. I urge the political leaders of Georgia to withdraw the draft law. As it was the case last year, it is clear that this legislation is incompatible with EU norms and values. If adopted, it would jeopardise Georgia’s progress on the EU path. Georgians have a future in the European Union. The candidate status that was granted last December has brought our relations closer than ever before. Our door is open. So I urge the Georgian leaders to mirror the expectations of the citizens and not derail the country from the EU path. The work of civil society and media organisations is crucial to any democracy. Georgia has a vibrant and diverse civil society that has contributed to the country’s successful progress towards EU membership. The proposed legislation would limit the capacity of civil society and media organisations to operate freely. It would limit freedom of expression and unfairly stigmatise organisations that deliver benefits to the citizens of Georgia. This would also impact the EU’s support to the Georgian people, as a part of it is channelled through NGOs. Transparency should not be used as an instrument to limit civil society’s capacity to operate freely. The Commission stressed in its enlargement report the work that Georgia needs to undertake and in particular the nine steps. As an EU candidate country, Georgia is expected to comply with the Copenhagen criteria, which specifically require adherence to principles of democracy, the rule of law and human rights. Only meaningful and irreversible progress in these fundamental areas determine the opening and the overall pace of accession negotiations. Finally, the EU urges the Georgian leaders to foster national consensus around the goal of joining the European Union. It is imperative for all political leaders to reduce polarisation and engage positively and constructively with each other and with civil society. Enlargement is a success when the whole country is behind this goal. It is also a strategic choice of any country that decides to embark on this path. It is a commitment to align not only with our norms, but also with our values. PRESIDENZA DELL'ON. PINA PICIERNO Vicepresidente",-,2024-04-23,14.

Eva Maydell,"Russia’s war against Ukraine comes with the loss of uncountable lives, the destruction of invaluable cultural heritage sites, and the annihilation of critical infrastructure, government buildings, and homes. To illustrate this dreadful trend: since the beginning of the war, Russia has destroyed over 1,700 medical facilities, including 200 large hospitals. Russia clearly has the imperative to pay for this on international legal and plain moral grounds. However, the aggressor will not pay willingly for the near future. The EU has a unique duty and opportunity to bridge the gap between Putin’s obligations and his actions. Over 260 billion euros of frozen Russian assets lay unused in several Western banks. The EU can and should tap into these funds to counteract a small bit of the inhumane destruction of this war. At the very least, we must redirect the profits of the assets to help Ukraine as quickly as possible. Moreover, we must seriously consider using the actual funds to help our neighbours defend themselves. Nothing we can do can fully right the wrongs committed by Russia.

Josep Borrell Fontelles,"Madam President, it’s difficult to conclude a debate where there are such different approaches. For some of you, it’s absolutely necessary to seize the capital, and for others, it is completely against international law and you don't want it to happen. Well, for the time being, we are going to take the revenues of the capital, which, according with the legal services, is in full accordance with international law. We can do that. That’s what I’ve been advised to do. And for the time being, we are not going to seize the capital because there is not enough clarity about what we can and cannot do. And certainly if we say that everything has to be done in accordance with international law, and the aggression against Ukraine is against international law, we cannot do something that is against international law unless we are sure that it is not against international law, because international law is international law, for one thing and for the other, and I cannot support the international law when it is on my side and not support it when it is not on my side. Otherwise it would be double standards – have you heard about double standards? So we do what we believe we can do, and we will continue studying and requiring legal advice in order to see what else we can do. Certainly, we would be very happy if we could take EUR 300 billion, but we have to act according with what we believe we could do. I understand there are differing opinions – it’s life.

It looks like the US would rather burn the world to the ground than see the end of their dominance over it. Even the IMF and Christine Lagarde have warned that the US bank proposals to use the frozen assets to finance the war risked breaking international law. You say that you’re only taking the revenue and you’re not taking the capital of the assets, but this recklessness will open a Pandora’s box, and just like the sanctions, this could easily rebound on the EU.

All of this violates EU norms and values. Allow me to offer one comparison.

Luděk Niedermayer,"Madam President, at the beginning let me share – and most of the colleagues share – dissatisfaction with the approach of the Council and Commission. Continuing the support for Ukraine is a must for us. This war is also about our security and about our values. In this context, it is really hard for me to understand the hesitation about money of the Russian state deposited in European banks or financial institutions – and I am here not talking about the revenues or interest; I am talking about money itself. I am very surprised to hear that such a move would harm our credibility or our legal position, and I am surprised to hear it from the ECB. If someone is of this opinion, this opinion really deserves very careful consideration in a broader context. I strongly believe that those who are acting clearly against the most important principles of the international order and cooperation cannot seek the protection of the same order and its rules. So I strongly urge you to really reconsider the situation, because it is really hard to sustain it.",PPE,2024-04-23,11.

Riho Terras,"Madam President, dear colleagues, the use of profits currently generated from the frozen assets is a step in the right direction. But we must be more ambitious and use the assets themselves to compensate Ukraine for war damage caused by Russia. Estonia is already working on a draft law to this end, and the EU as a whole should do the same. Frozen Russian assets should be liquidated, and the resulting money sent to Ukraine as an advance payment for war damages. Instead of waiting until the end of the war, the payment of reparations on an ongoing basis will also serve as a deterrent to the aggressor against continuing this war. There is a readiness in the G7, from the part of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, to do this. European members of the G7, namely Germany, France and Italy, need to stop dragging their feet and get on board with this important project.

Victor Negrescu,"Madam President, High Representative. Europe and the United States have shown unity in supporting the independence of Ukraine in front of the Russian aggressor. Beyond the support that has been decided recently by both sides of the Atlantic, indispensable for Ukraine to survive and protect the eastern flank, one of the key measures is related to frozen assets. The EU today applies restrictive measures in respect of 20 individuals and entities. Altogether, EUR 21 billion in assets are frozen in the EU, and more than EUR 300 billion in assets from the Central Bank of Russia are blocked in the G7 and EU countries. Despite this fact, Russian oligarchs and entities still escape the imposed restrictive measures and more needs to be done in order to make sure that they are being applied effectively across Europe, including to those working or doing business with Russia. Now we need to make full use of these assets by using them to protect and reconstruct Ukraine, compensate the victims and support the frontline countries affected by the war.

The truth is that we are all in danger and Ukraine is our last line of defence Yet the West is not doing enough to financially support Ukraine.

That’s what Donald Trump’s allies have been doing at the US Congress, and that’s what Viktor Orbán has been doing at the EU Council. In this House, we have been calling for the confiscation of all Russian state assets for years. And I repeat this call today. I am happy to hear that, finally, there is a chance for at least the profits from the assets to be redirected to Ukraine. But it came too late and it was weakened by Orbán, who yet again abused the veto threat and allowed to only go through in a weakened way.

This is a principle of international law that must fully apply to Russia, which brutally attacked Ukraine. So full confiscation of state assets must come. The delay in using Russian state assets to rebuild Ukraine is incomprehensible, unjustified and even risky. It gives no hope of justice and does not send a strong message to the aggressor side. We must stop hesitating about the volatility of the decision and take very concrete steps. Even the expropriation of the annual interest would be in Ukraine’s advantage, and, if continued for at least a decade, would represent a significant financial burden for Russia.

Włodzimierz Cimoszewicz,"Madam President, High Representative. Not often are the moral, legal, political and economic arguments for action as strong as in the case for confiscating Russia’s state assets to help Ukraine. Far too much time has been spent on the separate issue of taxing profits from those assets. Europe needs to seize all of Russia’s underlying assets, and it must do so now. Morally, everyone agrees that Russia must pay for its crimes. A lot of legal analysis arrives at the same conclusion we reached in the European Parliament a couple of months ago. On Saturday, the US House of Representatives adopted a bill authorising the US President to do that. From a political perspective, the time to seize these assets is also now, not in some distant future as part of peace negotiations. If we wait, we are unlikely to ever do so. Some critics of confiscating state assets say that doing so would disrupt financial markets and lead to the withdrawal of assets by countries like China, but where would these assets go? It doesn’t make sense at all. However, the idea of transferring to Ukraine the expected ten or more years—worth of profits can also be studied. Finally, let us also consider the consequences of the failure to seize these assets. Ukraine may simply run out of money to sustain its defensive efforts. Plus, the post-war economy and situation in this country, with hundreds of thousands of veterans struggling to find jobs, looking for jobs and to reintegrate into society. Europe needs to anticipate the potential political consequences. For all the talk of strategic autonomy in recent years.

Andrius Kubilius,"Madam President, dear colleagues. First of all, it is absolutely clear that the government of Georgia introduced a Russian-style ‘Agents of Foreign Influence’ Act in order to deliberately derail Georgia from the path towards the European Union. Second, it is absolutely clear that such a step is done by the Georgian Government because they deliberately want to show the Kremlin that they are implementing the Kremlin’s hybrid agenda. Third, we need to say very clearly that as long as such legislation is part of the Georgian legal order, any decisions leading to recommending the launch of accession negotiations should be permanently suspended. Fourth, we need to help the Georgian people to defend themselves from Kremlin hybrid influences on Georgia through the introduction of an EU Public Instrument of Russian Hybrid Influence Index, which will catalogue politicians and political parties in the EU and EU candidate countries according to their connections to the Putin regime and their involvement in spreading Kremlin narratives. Fifth, we should call on the Council to supplement the Copenhagen criteria for EU accession with the conditionality of a candidate country’s ability to stand up against Russia’s hybrid influence. Sixth, we should be very clear: the major obstacle on the European path of Georgia towards the EU is not the Georgian people, but the Georgian Dream Government. The same was happening with Slovakia, in 1997, when because of the Vladimír Mečiar government’s behaviour, Slovakia was invited to start negotiations only when Slovakia voters voted down that government.

Andrius Kubilius,"Madam President, dear colleagues, every day brings new damages to Ukraine, the amount of which goes far beyond the EUR 400 billion. Russia needs to pay fully for those damages. The victory of Ukraine demands a Western annual military support up to EUR 100 billion. According to Vice-President Borrell, the measures on Russian assets currently on the EU table allow to generate only around EUR 3 billion per year, while frozen Russian financial assets amount to nearly EUR 300 billion. That is why the EU should use the internationally recognised instruments of countermeasures, enabling Member States to seize all the frozen assets – not only the profits or revenues they generate – and use them to support Ukraine’s reconstruction and military needs. The fears that such confiscation is prohibited by the international principle of legal immunity applicable to state assets are totally wrong, since the recommendations of the international law and United Nations foresee that the states may use the countermeasures instrument in response to the internationally wrongful act of another state. That is exactly the case. The similar mechanism was used by the United States against Iranian state funds in 1981, as well as against Iraqi state funds in 1992, to compensate the damages inflicted on Kuwait. The same mechanism will be implemented by the US administration now, after the US Congress approved the confiscation of USD 20 billion of Russian frozen assets.

Helena Dalli,"Mr President, honourable Members, as you are well aware, the growth plan for the Western Balkans is accompanied by a proposal for an increase of financial assistance through a new instrument, namely, the Reform and Growth Facility, which consists of EUR 6 billion split into loans and grants. I appreciate the outcome of the final trilogue and I want to thank the European Parliament, especially Mr Picula and Mr Ressler, for the very good cooperation, which was absolutely vital for the adoption of this facility. This is a great achievement and a very positive development, eagerly awaited in the region, a new element in our toolbox that will help the Western Balkans partners grow faster and prepare better and quicker for EU membership one day. The final text represents a balanced agreement maintaining efficiency during the implementation of the facility, while providing unparalleled transparency and oversight to the Council and to the Parliament. The facility has a novel design where payments are linked to the implementation of socio-economic reform and reform related to the fundamental of the enlargement process, including rule of law and democracy. Each Western Balkan government is currently preparing a reform agenda that specifies a list of priority reforms, and I am pleased to share that we have made significant progress in developing these agendas together with our Western Balkan partners. They are working hard to finalise them. Following the political agreement on the regulation, we are working on a fast turnaround to adopt the reform agenda as to the final regulation text. We concentrate on defining measurable steps towards achievement of each reform. Importantly, each step will have a financial value that reflects its political importance and relevance to progressing on the enlargement path. We have therefore asked the Western Balkan governments to take into account the new objectives and the expanded policy framework of the facility, which create a stronger link to the enlargement process and priorities, without diminishing the whole focus on the immediate socio-economic growth of the region. This will help realise the objectives of the Growth Plan to speed up efforts for a European future for the Western Balkans. We are also stepping up consultations, which is also one of the requirements of the co-legislators. Each beneficiary is organising consultations with national stakeholders and on our side we are consulting civil society organisations and international financial institutions. We have also stepped up the preparation of the Western Balkans Investment Framework Investments pipeline, and have organised a number of joint stocktaking missions. It is critical now to keep up the highest ambition for reforms and ensure that we maintain the high momentum created. We have set up for ourselves a challenging timeline that should lead to start implementation already this summer. Of course, much will depend on the finalisation of the agendas and for that we need the beneficiaries to continue delivering on the last mile with the same high level of commitment demonstrated so far. The Commission will share the reform agendas with the Parliament and the Council as soon as they are available. The Commission will also share the facility and loan agreements with the Parliament and the Council, and provide strong oversight through the various provisions included in the final agreement, be it through annual reports on implementation and biannual presentations of payments and commitments, the public scoreboard on implementation, or the list of final recipients published by each beneficiary. In the spirit of compromise, the Commission also agreed to make available to the Council and the Parliament information on commitments and payments, both affected and planned under the Western Balkans Facility per beneficiary on a bimonthly basis. We, however, regret that despite these strong transparency and budgetary oversight provisions, the Council and Parliament still intend to adopt a joint declaration to review the budgetary nomenclature of the facility, setting up a budget line per beneficiary, for a facility that pre-foresees the exact amounts each beneficiary will receive if they fulfil all conditions, makes very limited sense. Any such changes to the budgetary nomenclature would unduly interfere with the proper conduct of the budgetary procedure, and could potentially affect the implementation of the facility. Anyway, we are overall happy that we were able to reach a balanced final agreement in record time, which is eagerly awaited in the region.",-,2024-04-23,19.

Tonino Picula,"Mr President, colleagues, first of all, I would like to thank my co-rapporteur, Mr Karlo Ressler, and all the shadow rapporteurs, as well as Secretariat and staff, but also the Council and Commission for an excellent cooperation we had on this important dossier. If I would have to describe the negotiations, I would say they were tough but constructive. We managed to strongly defend Parliament’s position by keeping united front from our side, which is something I very much commend. The Facility is the centrepiece of the Growth Plan for the Western Balkans, published by the Commission in November last year. The Facility will cover the period from second half of the current year to 2027, and is expected to provide up to 2 billion in grants and 4 billion in loans to the European Union Western Balkan partners. It will complement the existing Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA III), considerably increasing financial assistance to partners in the region. As the co-rapporteur from AFET, I would definitely like to emphasise some foreign policy and enlargement points that we have achieved throughout the negotiations. It is important to underline that for European Parliament, alignment of the Western Balkans countries with our Common Foreign and Security Policy was a main point. A reference to the CFSP is kept in the text as this is, for us, one of the key components of the overall policy framework on the enlargement processes. Eventually, convergence with the Council was reached on the following points: a reference to full alignment with the CFSP, including restrictive measures in Article 3, objectives 13 and 14, Reform Agendas. Related to this, a reference was added to fight disinformation and foreign information manipulation and interference, and moving forwards, harmonisation of visa policies with the Union. The placement of the text on Serbia-Kosovo dialogue remained in the Article 5 precondition, with the updated wording from the European Parliament. The Commission initially objected to the European Parliament wording in Article 5.2. Preconditions that the Commission shall also take into account recommendations of relevant international bodies, including the Venice Commission, Council of Europe or OECD. Finally, it was added to the text in the article after free and fair elections, which is especially important considering the recent elections in Serbia. We also managed to agree to add Commission Rule of Law Reports into the text as a part of the definition of the enlargement policy framework in Article 2. I also want to reiterate that the European Parliament went through a process in a uniquely unprecedented speed, having such a short time to come to negotiate in view of reaching an agreement, has proven very challenging, both on the political and technical level. The outcome in such a quick procedure has to be considered as an achievement. However, the European Parliament should not agree to such an extremely rushed procedure in the future. I believe that support for enlargement will continue in the next mandate. We, as the European Parliament, also stress the consistent message that enlargement can go hand in hand with internal EU debates. Therefore, I would like to point out several key points. Every candidate country should be judged on their merit. Our fundamental values, such as the rule of law and democratic standards, must be the pillar of our assessment if the country is ready to join the European Union. Building bridges, tunnels and highways is welcome, but respect for fundamental values must be a precondition for that. The European Union is more than an economic union, it is a union of values and shared risks. Once the candidate country fulfils all the criteria, there should be no political delays to its accession. EU enlargement is one of the most successful EU policies and it must continue. Dear colleagues, we have always supported EU enlargement and believe that our cooperation with Western Balkans countries is of crucial importance. But we always stress that joining the club is about adhering to certain values and norms that the Union represents. We need to deliver, but Western Balkan countries need to deliver too. Having said that, the waiting room before the European Union door is now completely full. The time has come to finally change that and start to fulfil the enlargement ambitions. As the mandate is ending, I am also proud to have authored the Parliament’s recommendations on the new EU strategy for enlargement. Revived enlargement policy will be an excellent legacy for this term and a message for the future. Thank you once again for your support.",S&D,2024-04-23,19.

Wopke Hoekstra,"Mr President, thank you very much for all your insights. And as many of you have underlined, this proposal is about promoting the sustainable use of our natural resources while at the same time supporting producers and our farmers. Let me briefly reiterate two things. One is that if we want a more sustainable agri-food chain, all species should be covered by obligatory value for sustainable cultivation and use requirements. Two, we should have derogations that support the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources without undermining quality and without creating wide exemptions that would actually lead to parallel and uncontrolled markets. So please let us keep these key elements of the proposal as we move forward. Thank you. And, Chair, if you allow me, there were a couple of speakers who said that they were here for the very last time. And, on behalf of the Commission, I would like to thank them for what they did. As many of us are aware, public service is not always easy. Public service is not always fair, and public service is not always rewarded. But I think what we do share with all the differences in political opinions is that it is always, truly, always tremendously meaningful. So thank you.",-,2024-04-23,18.

Seán Kelly,"A Uachtaráin, the proposed replacement of directives governing the production and marketing of plant and forest reproductive material is an important step towards enhancing agro biodiversity and restoring our forest ecosystems. Allowing for greater diversity of plant material available on the market will bolster agro-biodiversity and promote sustainable agriculture. A notable inclusion is provisions to facilitate the exchange of plant reproductive material among farmers, enabling them to access a broader range of genetic resources for cultivation. This will not only support the conservation of plant genetic resources, but also foster innovation and resilience within the agricultural sector. It makes sense that we see more cooperation between Member States in this area to ensure the availability of forestry productive material for reforestation projects, particularly in areas affected by extreme weather events. In addition, by improving traceability and labelling requirements for forest reproductive material, we inject a quality and authenticity insurance of planting stock used in forest restoration efforts. Lastly, I support measures that allow professional operators, and not only national authorities, to issue official labels accompanying forest reproductive materials. It is important that we enable the sector to modernise and effectively respond to the climate change challenges faced by land managers and farmers.",PPE,2024-04-23,18.

Wopke Hoekstra,"Mr President, honourable Members, I am replacing my dear colleague and friend, Commissioner Kyriakides, and I am honoured to be here on behalf of the Commission. President and honourable Members, our plant and forestry reproductive materials are central to our agrifood system and, of course, to food security. And with our proposals, we have aimed to ensure the quality, the identity and the resilience of this material throughout the value chain and whether they are for farmers, gardeners or foresters. With these two proposals, we bring the current legislation up to date and we essentially do three things: we strengthen sustainability considerations, we support the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources and, last but not least, we align the legislation with the latest scientific and technological developments. And let me thank the committees of agriculture and environment for their amendments and for the swift adoption of their reports. Honourable Members with the proposal on plant reproductive materials, we want to ensure that farmers will have suitable varieties – varieties that will help them avoid crop losses, mitigate the impact of climate change and strengthen food security. The obligatory examination for value for sustainable cultivation and use for all species is, of course, crucial to this. A longer transitional period than the two years we proposed might be needed, and I stress that it might be needed for vegetables and fruit varieties, where systematic examination is in fact a new requirement. But only a voluntary examination for vegetable and fruit varieties, as proposed, would actually lead to very limited testing or no testing at all for these species. The opportunity to comprehensively assess new varieties for sustainability will be lost, to the detriment of farmers and the environment. So therefore, our proposal aims to ensure consistency with the proposal for new genomic techniques. Furthermore, we aim for a regulatory framework that supports the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources and actually does give new opportunities to small farmers as well as to local initiatives. This is promoted by the proposed derogations for conservation varieties, conservation networks, marketing to final users and the exchange of seed in kind between farmers. However, these derogations should be specific to each of these activities and within the scope of the legislation, in order to retain a minimum level of traceability and quality. Wider exemptions from the scope of the legislation will lead to parallel and actually uncontrolled markets, reduce quality and increase – and this is the word I’ve been practising a lot, so let me try to get it right – phytosanitary risks.",-,2024-04-23,18.

Margaritis Schinas,"Mr President, honourable Members, let me thank you for your views and let me make three points to conclude this debate. First, on the content of the agreement itself. Let me repeat that we value this partnership as a partnership that is based on the values of mutual respect, equity and mutual strategic interest between the European Union and the country with whom we have historic relations and which has been proving a stable partner in a very unstable region at a very unstable moment. I have the fullest respect for the opinion of this House. I have myself served as a Member of the European Parliament. I understand your points but, frankly, I wouldn’t describe that five democratically elected prime ministers from three political families can be simply presented as Ursula and her friends. With all due respect, we are the European Union. We have elected leaders, and elected leaders have a stake in democracy as anybody else. Let me also assure you that the role of the European Parliament will be fully respected. The political support of this House for our common action is indispensable in the different aspects of this agreement. I want to assure Parliament that this House will be involved in all the important stages of the implementation of the macro-financial assistance. I want to stress that we will use the procedure of the regular macro-financial assistance, during which you will be consulted to keep you updated on the latest development and on the short-term MFA operation. And obviously, the Commission will remain at your disposal to debrief and inform this House and its committees at the different stages of the implementation of all aspects of the programme, both as regards preparation and implementation. Dear President, honourable Members, thirdly, this is the last address to this plenary for me in the current political cycle and I would like to take this opportunity to wholeheartedly thank this House for the support that I have received for the past five years. Together, we have achieved truly historic breakthroughs and successes. We have successfully navigated the pandemic. We modernised our pharma legislation. We invested in our health resilience and built a new ecosystem to fight cancer. We increased the Erasmus funds, three times. We grew a European alliance of universities and we set the stage for a common European degree. We invested in people and helped train 3.5 million workers. We made our Union more secure both online and offline, significantly reinforcing our cybersecurity legislation and critical infrastructure threats. We are overhauling the way the European Union manages migration with a new pact that you have voted massively last week, epitomising a firm but fair Union firmly rooted in our values. And we have shown unwavering support and commitment to Ukraine and its people, opening our doors and our hearts, and showing a simple fact: that the European way of life is not just something to be envied, but it’s also something to be shared. Honourable Members, these are all your successes. They are Europe’s successes. And I personally feel uniquely honoured to be able to share all these successes with you. Because whatever happens, whatever any of us do next, we will have done all this together. And of this, I’m really proud.",-,2024-04-23,17.

Margaritis Schinas,"Mr President, honourable Members, I’m really pleased to be here with you for this important debate. The Arab Republic of Egypt and the European Union have an historical relationship, and they are bound together for millennia. That’s why it makes perfect sense to have a mutually agreed partnership and relationship raised at the level of strategic and comprehensive character based on the values of equity, mutual respect and trust. On 17 March on her visit to Egypt, President von der Leyen, accompanied by the Prime Ministers of Greece, Belgium, Cyprus, Italy and Austria, in an unprecedented joint visit of European leaders, signed a joint declaration launching this strategic and comprehensive partnership between the EU and Egypt. What we are aiming for with this partnership is to recognise Egypt’s unique and vital geostrategic role as a pillar of security, moderation and peace in an increasingly unstable region of the Mediterranean, the Near East and Africa. Amid a rapidly deteriorating economic and fiscal situation over the last months, Egypt has been experiencing significant balance of payment pressure, with a very large exposure to the economic effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the conflict in Gaza and the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea. Our strategic partnership with Egypt identifies six areas of cooperation: political relations, macroeconomic stability, trade and investment, migration and mobility, security, and demography and human capital. Let me spare a few words for these chapters. First, on economic stability, the European Union is ready to support Egypt’s 2030 development agenda to secure long-term macroeconomic stability and sustainable economic growth based on jointly-defined priorities and reform objectives. Financing will support and accompany progress along these jointly-defined common priorities and objectives, which we also think will be able to unlock significant private sector investment. On investments more specifically, we are committed to enhance aspects of cooperation with Egypt in multiple fields of the modern economy. The new geopolitical and energy market reality requires deepening our existing partnership to support our energy security. The EU and Egypt agreed to step up the cooperation with a particular focus on renewable energy, energy efficiency, as well as the cooperation on other safe and sustainable low carbon technologies. Building on Egypt’s significant potential for cost-effective expansion of renewable power generation, we are attributing special importance to emblematic projects such as the electrical GREGY interconnector linking Egypt and Greece, as well as supporting the work of the East Med Gas Forum with a view to strengthening energy cooperation and security of gas supply in the region, and through the region with the EU. On migration and mobility, guided by the principles of partnership, shared responsibility and burden sharing, Egypt and the European Union adopt a holistic approach to governing migration. The Union will further provide the necessary financial support to assist Egypt on migration-related programmes, including on legal migration pathways and mobility schemes such as the Talent Partnerships. Our aim is to tackle the root causes of irregular migration, combating smuggling of migrants and trafficking in persons, as well as strengthening border management. Equally, we find it is important to ensure dignified and humane return and integration. The EU and Egypt will continue to cooperate in order to support Egypt’s efforts in hosting refugees, and we are both committed to the protection of migrants and refugees. To underpin this overall level of partnership, the EU is proposing a significant EUR 7.4 billion of financial and investment support for Egypt until 2027. Out of this money, EUR 5 billion will be macro-financial assistance and EUR 2.5 billion will be from the Neighbourhood Development and International Cooperation Instrument funds. This is a game changer. Honourable Members of the Parliament, the aim of the EU strategic and comprehensive partnership with Egypt is to elevate our relations with this important strategic partner – but doing it based on the values of equity, mutual respect and trust. This is equally important for us as it is for them. Especially in these dark, turbulent, unstable times, this partnership has a win-win potential.",-,2024-04-23,17.

Cristian-Silviu Buşoi,"Madam President, dear colleagues, dear Commissioner, as chair of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I have had many discussions on the Energy Charter Treaty, and we had debates inside the committee, and a couple of months ago, together with my coordinators, we came to the decision that it is time to withdraw from the Energy Charter Treaty. In our discussions, two major reasons appear always: the current climate mitigation will demand an acceleration of the phase-out of fossil fuels and a rapid transition to renewable energy, and the fact that the number of investor-state dispute settlement cases is rising each year. We have cooperated fruitfully with the other EU institutions to adopt legislation aimed to ensure the transition of our energy systems and achieve the strategic goals of energy security, energy efficiency and decarbonisation. Moreover, as long as the European Union is still a member of the ECT, even the EU Member States that have already left the ECT can still be sued for pursuing EU policies. Last but not least, the Charter needs to be modernised and aligned with the Paris Agreement, the EU Climate Law and our climate objectives. It is clear that we need to have a balanced transition. We will still need gas for our transition, but we need to support strongly renewables and clean technologies for a more competitive and better future of the European Union.

Danuta Maria Hübner,"Madam President, Commissioner, we all agreed that the current Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) is outdated and is not compatible with the EU Green Deal objectives, and that is why the EPP has always supported the EU collective exit from the ECT, but linked to the modernisation of the treaty. Unfortunately, two years ago, political conditions for the ECT modernisation at the Council and at the EP level did not exist. Now, the new approach proposed by the European Commission opens the possibility for the EU to withdraw from the ECT. Parliament is expected to give its consent for the Council decision on the withdrawal and the EPP is supportive of the withdrawal decision of the Council. For the modernisation to take place during the November ECT Conference, Member States wishing to stay in the ECT should not prevent its modernisation. We expect the Council to accept this approach and hope that this agreement regarding the authorisation procedure will not become a stumbling block for those states that would like to remain members of the modernised treaty.

Kadri Simson,"Madam President, Honourable Members of the European Parliament. I am pleased to be here today at this debate. The Energy Charter Treaty is a multilateral trade and investment agreement applicable to the energy sector which was signed already 30 years ago, in 1994, and entered into force in 1998. The Treaty sets up a framework for international cooperation in the energy field between its contracting parties. Nevertheless, since 1998, the Treaty has not been substantially updated while the EU’s investment policy and energy and climate goals have been updated. As a consequence, in 2018, the EU and its Member States called for a modernisation of the outdated Treaty and carried out the negotiations between 2019 and 2022, in order to align the Treaty to Union law and policy, notably on investment protection and energy and climate goals. Whereas the negotiations were successful in modernising the Treaty, despite efforts on all sides, the Council unfortunately did not back the Commission proposal on the adoption of the modernised Energy Charter Treaty at the end of 2022. In the meantime, some Member States started the process of withdrawing from the treaty. Italy, France, Germany and Poland have already left, and Luxembourg, Portugal and Slovenia are in the process of withdrawal. Remaining in this Treaty exposes the Union to the adverse impact of an unreformed Treaty, which is incompatible with our energy and climate goals, as well as the principle of autonomy of Union law. In view of the situation, in July last year the Commission proposed for the Union to withdraw from the Treaty. Parliament also supported the Union’s withdrawal from the Energy Charter Treaty in its resolution on of 24 November 2022. The Commission’s position was to ensure a uniform withdrawal of the EU and all Member States jointly, in view of the exclusive competence on investment that the Treaty covers and the coherence of our international representation, including to uphold our energy and climate goals. Mindful of the urgent need to ensure a swift withdrawal from the nature of the treaty, in March this year, the Commission made a complementary proposal to allow the modernisation of the Energy Charter Treaty. This proposal makes it possible to unblock the current stalemate and ensures swift withdrawal of the EU from the Energy Charter Treaty, but also shortens the sunset clause significantly. Following the EU’s withdrawal, the Commission – in its right of initiative – would discuss and assess the conditions and modalities for individual Member States to remain in a modernised treaty. Against this background, both the EU withdrawal and the modernisation proposal should move in parallel and be adopted by the Council as a package, if the European Parliament gives its consent to the proposal for the Union withdrawal from the Treaty. I welcome the positive vote in the joint INTA and ITRE committee to recommend to the Parliament to give its consent to proceed with an EU withdrawal from the Treaty that is not aligned with our energy and climate agenda. The Union remaining in this Treaty is not an option. I am looking forward to your debate and to the vote tomorrow.",-,2024-04-23,16.

From a political and humanitarian perspective, the situation remains one of the most tragic and visible crises in the Americas. Unfortunately, we must also acknowledge that the humanitarian situation is not receiving an adequate international response. More robust collective efforts are needed to enhance the delivery of lifesaving aid to Haitians. A genuine Team Europe approach is crucial at this point to take up this challenge, and the European Commission is determined to play its part. At the same time, we very much hope the transition plan, as was agreed, will be viable and sustainable as this is currently the best hope for the country.

Janez Lenarčič,"Madam President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, the political, social and humanitarian crisis in Haiti continues unabated, with the dire situation exacerbated by the surge in violence perpetrated by armed gangs, notably in the past few months. This rampant insecurity, which severely hinders the capacity of state institutions to function, is alarming. Reports from the UN Integrated Office in Haiti paint a bleak picture. Lawless gang violence has permitted all aspects of daily life, particularly in Port-au-Prince, where human rights abuses have reached unprecedented levels. Approximately 80 % of the capital is under the direct control of gangs, leading to the closure of major ports and the airport. The consequences of these closures on the imports of food and medical supplies are disastrous. Regional dynamics also play a crucial role, with illicit firearms fuelling gang-related activities and drug trafficking across the Caribbean and towards Europe. Violence has also spread to rural areas and essential services, with hospitals and schools becoming targets of violence. Haitian women bear a disproportionate burden of this crisis, with cases of gender based violence and rape increasing dramatically. The situation has forced the internal displacement of hundreds of thousands of people, including a significant number of children. This violence has translated into an acute humanitarian crisis, and millions of Haitians require urgent humanitarian assistance. We continue to support the people of Haiti by any means in our power, working with humanitarian partners. Despite huge security and logistic challenges, the EU has committed nearly EUR 40 million in humanitarian aid in the last two years and is committing EUR 20 million more in 2024. In April, an EU humanitarian air bridge was launched and it has successfully delivered 62 tonnes of medical supplies and relief items from our stockpile in Panama to Haiti. It is also imperative to curtail the flow of illicit arms and strengthen law enforcement and border control measures. The EU supports the training, equipment and customs control efforts of the Haitian National Police through our EUR 3 million contribution to the UNDP Managed Basket Fund. Amidst this crisis, political negotiations continue – although maybe too slowly. We congratulate our partners in CARICOM for their continuous efforts in bringing the main Haitian stakeholders together to pursue this dialogue. Progress has been made, with the power-sharing agreement reached in Kingston, Jamaica, on 11 March on the establishment of a transitional governance structure with the appointment of a new Transitional Presidential Council and of its members. This is an important step, as it opens the way for the deployment of a multinational security support mission to strengthen the efforts of the Haitian National Police in its fight against the gangs, restore the rule of law and the basic security conditions in the country, and ultimately pave the way for the holding of free and fair elections. The EU stands ready to provide its support to the broader objectives of this mission. The process is not yet complete. We urge all Haitian political forces to continue the work by appointing an interim prime minister and government, as well as selecting members for the Provisional Electoral Council. As a longstanding partner of Haiti, the EU is determined to remain engaged and to accompany Haitians during these difficult times.",-,2024-04-23,15.

Janez Lenarčič,"Madam President, honourable Members, this debate today demonstrates that we share the wish of seeing Georgia succeed in its reforms and on its European path. And this is also the wish of the people of Georgia. And now, we need Georgian leaders to deliver, to work hard on the reforms to advance on its chosen European path.

Clare Daly,"Madam President, so here we go again, giving out about foreign interference in Georgia while brazenly interfering ourselves. We never talk about the reality of life in a country where almost a quarter of the population lives abroad, driven out by abject poverty and non-existent labour rights. The median wage in Georgia is about EUR 360 a month. Emigration is the main thing Georgians expect from EU membership. They’re not starry-eyed believers in our values, they have much bigger problems to worry about. And while the EU zealously runs the rule of law over every aspect of Georgian law and society to see if it measures up to our values, it does absolutely nothing to improve wages or conditions in Georgia. You couldn’t care less about them. Georgia’s NGO class is absolutely maximalist when it comes to liberal reforms but, like the EU, is meekly minimalist when it comes to the building blocks of a decent life: workers’ rights, minimum wages and social security. That’s what happens when your grassroots movement is led from the top and powered by grant money. You’d see deeper roots on an Astroturf pitch.

Josep Borrell Fontelles,"Madam President, as we have been speaking about the situation in Gaza, in another part of the world, Ukraine continues its courageous self-defence against Russian aggression. There at least we have new goods. At least from my point of view, when the US Congress have finally finished an agreement. This was very timely, because in the meantime Russia is escalating its bombardment against Ukrainian towns, against civilians, against thermal power plants, even against dams, flouting basic international rules and standards. The news from the front line is also worrying. Wars are also one of morale, and the US support package will also boost the morale of courageous Ukrainian defenders. We know that the next weeks will be difficult. But perhaps more dangerous even for Ukraine and European security. Especially we Europeans, we can, and we must do more. We can and we must do more because it is a matter of European strategic responsibility. When we talk about a strategic responsibility it means that we have to take our part, because there is ‘no business as usual’ in Europe since the war started in February 2022. We have done a lot, but I’m sure that we can do more and quicker. We have to be more audacious. We have also failed to plan for the midterm. We have always looked at the curve of the latest Russia escalation against Ukraine before we take our own decisions. And I said several times, and I have to repeat today in the last session of this Parliament. Unhappily, this is a war of attrition. And Putin will continue this war to conquer as much as Ukraine as he can. So it’s not going to finish soon. Putin will try to subjugate the freedom of Ukrainian people. And maybe go beyond Ukraine. Well, at least that’s what the propagandists and some Russian leaders say all the time. So our policies for this war have been many times ad hoc. And now we have to put them in a more stable and more sustainable footing in order to support Ukraine in the long term. When they got started, nobody could expected it to last two years. For Putin, the plan was only a couple of weeks. Two years later, we are in a situation that he could never have imagined. We have to think deeper. We have to prepare ourselves for a war that will require our efforts, our commitment, our actions. You have to continue supporting Ukraine, but not only by words and not only for tomorrow, and maybe not only for next year. Our commitment to support Ukraine, which is fighting for our values and their security, will require unprecedented actions. It will require more boldness. And the topics of today are one example. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, we immobilised, together with our G7 members and other partners, the assets of the Russian Central Bank. We immobilised these assets. These assets are today being managed by the central securities depositories and generate extraordinary revenues. Because the interest rate has increased a lot. So this capital is providing much bigger revenues. After long discussions, after studying carefully, the rule of law that can be used in order to assess what we can do and what we should not do. We reached the conclusion that these extraordinary revenues could be used to support the immediate needs of Ukraine to defend itself. And how to do that? Well, I have to confess that this has been an unchartered territory and we need to innovate. We decided to pursue the goal of using these revenues for the support of Ukraine, with a stepwise approach. In the first step, adopted by the Council in February, we introduced rules for the central security depositories that generate these revenues, to keep them aside, to identify them, to keep them aside and account for them separately. And these revenues, now they are on separate accrual accounts. We expect this mechanism could provide approximately EUR 3 billion annually. And in addition, we increase the legal certainty by making clear that this revenue does not belong to Russia, since they are not sovereign assets, but make a clear difference between the capital and the revenues. I am talking about the revenues and now we are advancing with the next step. A month ago, as High Representative, who is entitled by the Treaty to make proposals to the Council, I proposed to the Council to use these revenues to support Ukraine with military means through our European peace facility. And in order for you to clarify which was my proposal as High Representative, supported by the Commission through a Council regulation, I want to stress three main points here. First, Ukraine urgently need weapons and ammunition to defend itself and its people against Russian missiles, drones, glide bombs and constant attack. We initially envisaged to use these revenues to support Ukraine’s recovery and reconstruction, but I think that before thinking about reconstruction, we have to think about avoiding destruction. – para evitar más destrucción. Lo haremos a través del Fondo Europeo de Apoyo a la Paz, que —como ustedes saben— ha sido utilizado desde el principio de la guerra para apoyar a Ucrania con ayuda militar. El otro 10 % será asignado al presupuesto de la Unión para medidas de reconstrucción y medidas de apoyo a la industria de la defensa, porque —como ustedes saben—, hasta que no haya mejor criterio, el presupuesto de la Unión no puede ser utilizado para comprar armas. Y por eso diseñamos el Fondo Europeo de Apoyo a la Paz, que no es parte del presupuesto de la Unión, sino de un fondo intergubernamental que no está sometido a esta limitación. En segundo lugar, quiero reiterarles que esta iniciativa se refiere única y exclusivamente al uso de las rentas generadas por estos activos inmovilizados, no a los activos en ellos mismos, no al capital, sino a la renta producida por este capital. Podemos pensar otras acciones, pero, de momento, creemos que esto es algo que se sostiene legalmente y que, por lo tanto, podemos coger estos ingresos —estas rentas— y asignarlos como les he dicho antes: 90 % al Fondo Europeo de Apoyo a la Paz y 10 % al presupuesto de la Unión. Finalmente, esta iniciativa ha sido tomada en plena coordinación con los otros Estados del G–7, en cooperación con nuestros socios internacionales. Esta propuesta ha sido elevada al Consejo a través de una propuesta de Decisión del Consejo propuesta por el vicepresidente de la Comisión / alto representante de la Unión para Asuntos Exteriores y Política de Seguridad, que es quien puede hacerlo, de acuerdo con el Tratado. Esta propuesta está acompañada de una propuesta conjunta de la Comisión y de mí mismo para ver de qué manera se puede aplicar esta Decisión si el Consejo la adopta. El Consejo las está discutiendo.

Ireland needs a massive investment to build schools, hospitals, houses for people and to aid the transition to a clean economy. So what does the EU propose? Hardening the austerity rules. With this plan, democratically elected governments will traipse to Brussels and ask permission to change budgets if arbitrary targets are not met. There is no exemption for building houses, but there is for building tanks. We were promised rules to aid investment: we got a doubling down on austerity rules and the failed policies of the past.

The revision of CLP significantly increases the level of protection of consumers and the environment, as it introduced new hazard classes and thus increased the level of information provided for all products containing chemicals. We made the rules on marketing chemicals simpler and more transparent. Also, we go on with digital labelling, where possible, and provide instructions in order to address risks from online sale.

Helena Dalli,"Mr President, apology accepted. In its draft resolution objecting the delegated regulation proposing to increase the visa fee, the European Parliament states that during the inter-institutional negotiations on the digitalisation of visa procedures, the co-legislators agreed not to increase the visa fees due to estimated cost savings of a fully digitalised visa procedure. There was however no political agreement relating to the freezing of visa fees formalised in the amending regulation introducing the digitalisation of visa procedures. In the Commission’s understanding neither was there any informal agreement expressed orally during the political trilogues between the co-legislators to maintain the visa fee at its current level pending the implementation of the digitalisation of visa procedures. Digitalisation will only take place at the earliest as of 2028. And therefore the argument of cost savings is currently not relevant. The Commission does not agree with the Parliament’s statement that the proposal to increase the visa fee through the procedure provided for in Article 16(9) of the Visa Code ‘constitutes a breach of the agreement between the co-legislators reached during the inter-institutional negotiations, and, thus, undermines the principle of sincere cooperation’.

Helena Dalli,"Mr President, Members, the EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive establishes a policy on third countries, and mandates the Commission to identify third-country jurisdictions with strategic deficiencies in their anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism regimes. In line with EU legislation, the FATF list is the baseline of the EU list of high-risk third countries. Following the latest developments from the Financial Action Task Force, the Commission updated its list on 14 March 2024, proposing to add Kenya and Namibia, and to remove Barbados, Gibraltar, Panama, Uganda and the United Arab Emirates. In line with EU legislation, the Commission is committed to updating its list as soon as possible after the FATF plenary. Today, I am here to address Parliament’s concerns regarding the delisting of Gibraltar, Panama and United Arab Emirates. But let me also underline the importance of this vote in recognising the investment and positive progress made by the other jurisdictions proposed for delisting in this delegated act. The Commission, as a founding member of the FATF, has been closely involved in the delisting process of the UAE and Gibraltar within the FATF. Following on-site visits, the FATF concluded that all the shortcomings identified in the anti-money laundering / counter-terrorism financing regimes of these jurisdictions have been addressed through the implementation of their action plans. No additional EU benchmarks were required for these jurisdictions since the Commission has assessed that the FATF action plans were sufficiently comprehensive in view of the EU delisting criteria. Therefore, in line with EU legislation, the Commission proposed to delist Gibraltar and the UAE swiftly after their delisting by FATF. During the FATF plenary in February 2024, the Commission called on the UAE to continue improving its AML/CFT regime and to further collaborate in the field of international cooperation. The Commission is committed to closely follow developments on strengthening international cooperation in the existing structural dialogue with the UAE, in close cooperation with the European External Action Service. Panama was already delisted by the FATF in October 2023. It was not immediately delisted because the Commission decided to impose additional requirements to those in the FATF action plan. Panama has provided evidence to the Commission on the fulfilment of the EU additional benchmarks. The Commission services have evaluated this information and shared its assessment with the European Parliament, Member States and the Council. Therefore, the Commission is proposing to delist Panama following improvements in the transparency of beneficial ownership information. Panama has notably demonstrated that its competent authorities are effectively responding to foreign requests for cooperation in identifying and exchanging basic and beneficial ownership information of legal persons and legal arrangements. On the specific situation of the UAE, I hear your concerns. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the EU has imposed strong sanctions to curb Russia’s war capabilities. These sanctions are applicable within the EU and to EU operators. Russia is, as we know, actively seeking ways to circumvent our sanctions by, among others, relying on imports from third countries. EU sanctions do not apply extraterritorially. They only apply to third country operators if there is an involvement of an EU operator. Fighting sanctions circumvention is one of our key priorities. Let me note that there is no legal basis in the EU AML/CFT framework to counter sanctions circumvention. We are addressing sanctions circumvention via other instruments. The Commission monitors trade to prevent the flow of restricted goods into Russia, and is able to identify suspicious trade routes and entities engaged in this trade. The UAE is among the third countries for which a careful monitoring of trade is being undertaken. The Commission is in close contact with the UAE on potential sanctions evasion through its territory. EU Special Envoy for Sanctions, David O’Sullivan, has visited the country twice, in February and September 2023. Subsequently, the UAE authorities prohibited the re-export of sensitive battlefield items to Russia. This was an important step. Additionally, two UAE-based entities have been listed in the latest EU sanctions package imposing export restrictions from the EU to these companies. It is true that signs are not encouraging and there is a lack of transparency on data from the UAE side. Therefore, the Commission will continue to conduct political outreach and seeks to organise bilateral technical meetings between administrations to foster cooperation on suspicious trade patterns. In fact, the Special Envoy is on a visit to the UAE this week in order to further his discussions with authorities. Finally, let me assure you that we remain proactive and vigilant. We will continue assessing the situation, and we are ready to address any risks for the efficiency of our sanctions policy and for the protection of the EU’s financial system.",-,2024-04-23,"5.6.

Our response to that substantial shock was ambitious. The same sense of ambition is reflected in this political agreement. Adoption by the Parliament following this debate would pave the way for revised fiscal rules to enter into force by the end of April. They would then start to guide Member States’ economic policies for the years to come. This would be accomplished by a simpler system and greater national ownership to ensure enhanced compliance and effectiveness. As many of you have raised this issue, let me recall that the new framework will strengthen the social dimension within the European Semester. The new fiscal rules will serve as a cornerstone of the EU’s macroeconomic and financial stability. This means acting to reduce debt and keep it at a sustainable level; ensuring sound public policies across all Member States; and building a solid base for future growth based on reforms and investments.

Bas Eickhout,"Mr President, we are in a position of a crucial decade for investments within Europe. Talking about the Green Deal and our competitiveness that we had in the previous discussion. Investments are crucial for European competitiveness and, if we look around the world, Europe is lagging behind. On defence, a lot of our colleagues are also pressing investments in defence. We need to build up Ukraine, which will be massive investments. This decade will be a decade of investments or we will lose out as a European Union. And then look what’s happening. Will there be a continuation of the RF? Probably not. Countries will block it. Will there be an MFF review that will be sincere? Well, even the mid-term review was a joke. Then Capital Markets Union: it’s being blocked. Will there then be any sustainable finance to guide private financing to the right sources? It’s stalled and being halted and no movement there. And now on top of that, we are going to limit the possibilities of national governments to invest by this reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, we are tying ourselves down where there should be a decade of investments.

Frances Fitzgerald,"Mr President, Commissioner, there can be no equality without the eradication of violence against women and domestic violence. That’s clear. This week, we have the opportunity to live up to one of our founding European ideals: equality between women and men. Equality across the European Union is floundering in some places: hateful LGBTQ zones created to bully people into conformity, brutal rollback of abortion care and the ever-thundering train of domestic violence that never gets quieter, it seems, but actually – as we’ve seen through the COVID-19 pandemic – only gets louder. And why are women targeted? Because there is, sadly, just beneath the surface, the belief that women are lesser. Every year, gender-based violence costs the European Union a staggering EUR 366 billion – a cost that we cannot afford economically but one we cannot afford socially, because behind these numbers we find fractured families, traumatised children and devastated women living in fear every single day. So the opportunity that presents itself here to us today is to make a stand for the women of Europe, to adopt the directive on combating violence against women and domestic violence. This will send a strong message across the European Union to all 27 Member States and 450 million citizens: we’ll not stand for violence. We have to build on the accession of the Istanbul Convention. We are creating a robust framework. So the goal should be that Europe will be the first continent in the world to eradicate violence against women. But the adoption tomorrow is not enough. We need a robust monitoring framework and a genuine commitment across all levels of government to ensure that this is really implemented, that we tackle this with the right resources and supports. And I would say to the ministers for justice across the European Union – and we saw ambivalence from some of them – to do your absolute utmost, learn from your colleagues across Europe what works well, exchange best practice, fight for that extra bit of budget, invest in resources and make successful tackling of this crime your legacy. We do not want to cut corners on the implementation of this legislation. Don’t try and minimise it; build on it. To the Prime Ministers and Presidents: work with your governments to make sure that this is implemented, that you build on the very best practice so you build a society that’s fit for the women and girls of today and tomorrow. And, obviously, to the European Commission – congratulations to them, to the Commissioner here and Ursula von der Leyen – be clinical in your examination of the transposition of this directive, because this really matters. And do tell us, when the time comes, what has been achieved. I know we will have more to do because, as I have said, this is the beginning. We have come far with this directive. We should have gone further but there was huge resistance, as my colleague Evin Incir has said. But I am confident that with this directive, our Union will be a better place for its adoption. But, again, the real work begins now. Let’s make sure that that’s done all over Europe. We need to go forward together, and there was great cooperation in this House when we were working on this directive. We need to go forward and achieve that secure European future that the women of Europe and the young girls of Europe deserve. I wholeheartedly urge every Member of this House to vote in favour of this directive tomorrow. Do not be distracted. It can save and change countless lives of women right across Europe. This directive is very important. It has new offences. It has sections on prevention, on support, on protection and on prosecution. It really matters that we implement this directive after 10 long years and, indeed, decades.",PPE,2024-04-23,7.

Agnes Jongerius,"Mr President, allow me to make a comparison. For the last ten years, we have been working to remodel our garden. So we mowed the lawn, we planted new trees, we sewed the grass, and we sewed flowers, but we forgot that we never were able to remove or reduce the barrier that’s blocking the water supply. And the vital thing to make the garden grow is water and that’s lacking in the economic governance review. We know, of course, for years that the old rules didn’t work. They had to be revised, but we forgot to ensure enough room for investments. The lack of fiscal capacity ultimately dehydrates our economy. We need a strong investment plan that accompanies the new rules. So therefore I cannot, in good conscience, vote in favour of these rules.",S&D,2024-04-23,3.

Paolo Gentiloni,"Mr President, honourable Members, we have a lot of work behind us to correct the existing fiscal rules – rules so rigid that they were often not applied. What we have achieved is not perfect. It is a compromise, a good compromise. The result of the determination by all to advance and improve the current legislative work. I want to thank very sincerely all rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs for their engagement and openness. It was not easy, but it was – and is – important to move forward. The new rules provide more leeway to Member States to set their fiscal trajectory. At the same time, the new framework strengthens incentives for public investment, as the European Parliament had also strongly called for. This is done primarily via the possibility to have a more gradual fiscal adjustment against a set of reforms, and investment meeting certain criteria, and via the exclusion of national co-financing of Union programmes from the net expenditure indicator. The reform framework pays greater attention to social aspects. It acknowledges, for instance, that the surveillance by the Commission will include the monitoring of progress in implementing the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights and its headline targets via the social scoreboard and framework to identify social convergence risks. And let me underline the crucial contribution of the EMPL Committee to strengthen this particular aspect. The social pillar is also part of the EU common priorities, together with the green and digital transitions and defence as important areas for reform and investment commitments in exchange for a more gradual fiscal adjustment path. I’ve said it before, we have a lot of work behind us. During this time we saw the European economy first collapse for the pandemic, then recover strongly in 2021 and 2022, before slowing sharply after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which sparked very high inflation. Across these stages, general escape clause was in force. Now we have, on one hand, the prospect of reducing the accumulated debt and deficit as a result of these two black swans. On the other hand, we must reinforce our weak growth with the recovery of purchasing power, a decline in inflation, and the preservation of public investments. A delicate balance, indeed. But it is to this delicate balance that these new rules are adapted. The adoption of the reform after today’s debate and vote will allow the submission of the first round of medium-term fiscal structural plans already this year. This is the set of rules we need to face current and future challenges with confidence. It will allow a gradual reduction of public debts while not undermining growth. It will help us protecting the level of public investment, which is more than ever needed to finance the green and digital transitions, safeguard our social model and ensure the security of the continent. So I look forward to a good debate.",-,2024-04-23,3.

Valdis Dombrovskis,"Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission welcomes the provisional political agreement between the European Parliament and the Council on reforming the EU’s economic governance. This ambitious agreement delivers on the objectives of the Commission’s reform proposal to strengthen Member States’ debt sustainability, and to promote their sustainable and inclusive growth. The revised fiscal rules will help to make the EU more competitive, to strengthen its resilience to tackle the challenges that we face today as well as tomorrow. It addresses several existing shortcomings. It places a greater focus on reducing high debt ratios and deficits in a realistic, gradual and sustained way. It also leaves more room for counter-cyclical policies and incentivises reforms and investments. It supports greater compliance with the rules – for example, by focusing Member States’ plans and their monitoring on a single operational indicator based on net expenditure. We simplify implementation and avoid certain pro-cyclical bias that fiscal policy has had in the past. Let me remind you of the key elements of the revised rules. First, stronger national ownership and differentiation. At the core of the reform are the national medium-term fiscal structural plans. These bring countries’ fiscal reform and investment policies together. The fiscal path will become more differentiated based on the degree of fiscal sustainability challenges. These changes will allow more scope for taking countries’ specific challenges and priorities into account. Second, incentives for reforms and investments. Member States that commit to implementing priority reforms and investments will benefit from a more gradual fiscal adjustment path. Reforms should contribute to fiscal sustainability, promote sustainable and inclusive growth, and contribute to achieving common EU objectives. These include pressing ahead with the green and digital transitions, strengthening Europe’s security and defence, and putting the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights into effect. Third, better enforcement and common safeguards. Rules are only fully effective if they go hand in hand with credible enforcement. This is why the greater lever for Member States is constrained by a set of common EU safeguards to ensure transparency and equal treatment. The debt-based excessive deficit procedure will be strengthened; a control account will monitor slippages over time; and more effective financial sanctions will enter into force. Honourable Members, it has been a long journey to reach this point. The time has now come to start the implementation. We expect Member States to submit their medium-term fiscal structural plans by 20 September. This will provide clarity about their fiscal policy for years ahead and will set out key reforms and investments. So I look forward to this debate on this crucial topic for the EU’s future resilience.",-,2024-04-23,3.

Maroš Šefčovič,"Madam President, honourable Members, I very much would like to express my gratitude for this debate, which in a great sense reflected upon the lessons of the five years and strategic agenda for the future. And from many of your interventions, it’s very clear that we all remember very vividly our debates on all difficult moments, which at those times seemed that they would present unsurmountable challenges, for Europe and the European Union. But I have to say that thanks to our common actions, energetic steps, innovative measures and, I would underline, interinstitutional and European unity and solidarity, we have proven wrong all those who hoped that those unprecedented crises would bring turmoil into Europe and into the European Union. We have proven that the European Union is indispensable in this new, rough world. And our economy has clearly proven to be more resilient than many thought. And thanks to SURE and Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni, who just joined us, we have saved millions of jobs and businesses across all EU Member States. Having said all this, I fully agree with all the honourable Members calling for more clear European focus on competitiveness and on tackling bureaucracy. We have just completed a series of clean transition dialogues with industry, and we are actively communicating with our citizens and NGOs on all aspects of the Green Deal. I can tell you that the main takeaways are quite obvious: our citizens, but also our industry, want to live in a cleaner environment, healthier nature, and want to have a more competitive economy. I would also underline that there is a clear link between our strong performance in clean and green tech and our overall competitiveness. We are competing with other major economies in sectors and in areas like who would manufacture more performing batteries, who will make better electric vehicles, better heat pumps, who will be more efficient in constructing hydrolysers, and who will be capable to scale up production much faster than the other competitor in the commodities like green steel or green hydrogen. So, therefore, we have to continue to work very hard in those sectors and, of course, to fight for competitiveness and our industry in our European way. This means with full respect for high European social values, with social fairness to underpin the unique social model built over the generations in Europe. We have to lower prices of energy. We have to fight very hard for the global level playing field in a more assertive way. And also we have to make sure that those companies who produce in a sustainable way, with a low carbon footprint and treat their employees decently should be rewarded for their work and not punished by usually ending up on the second or third place in the public procurement. So we would need to adjust that approach as well. If you look at public procurement across the European Union, we spend through public procurement around EUR 2 trillion per year. It’s 14 % of our GDP, and this is a massive fiscal instrument, which we have to learn how to use better in the future, because what we need is more investment into our economy and less bureaucracy. A lot of you addressed the issue of the Capital Markets Union, and I think it’s very obvious that this should be a clear priority for the next Commission and for the next European Parliament. We cannot afford to have EUR 33 trillion in our savings accounts, with a better prospect to be invested elsewhere than in the European Union. We just have to make it more attractive, more conducive, to make sure that these huge fiscal reserves we have on savings accounts in our banks would be invested here in the European Union. We also hear you loud and clear on the need to simplify, streamline and use modern technologies when it comes to oversight, when it comes to reporting. Very soon we will present to you and to the European public detail report on reduction of annual administrative burden and also on the reduction of reporting obligations. But I know that this will not be enough, and that we simply also in this area will have to go much further. And I’m a strong believer that with a new technology, let’s say, with the satellite imagery, use of the artificial intelligence and the digitalisation of our administrative processes, we can achieve much more than until today. Honourable Members, Madam President, this legislature comes to a close, and I really would like to use this opportunity to thank all of you for excellent cooperation and to call for support again in the future for more European unity, more European solidarity, because, let’s be honest, also, next mandate will be challenging. And I think that it would be at least as difficult as this one and therefore we need the European spirit, we need cooperation, and we need this interinstitutional and European solidarity to navigate us through the times which will be ahead of us.",-,2024-04-23,"2.

Luděk Niedermayer,"Madam President, the importance of this topic is growing every day. I’m glad that, symbolically, we are discussing the topic at the last Plenary. Recognising the issue is not enough; we must start to solve it, and very quickly. Let me make four suggestions, before the report of Mario Draghi will probably be more detailed and more descriptive. The first: make the single market better, work better. Enrico Letta made some suggestions. It’s obvious that we should proceed in the energy market, make sure that cheap energy is available across the Union. Services, particularly communication. And obviously the financial capital markets union is a project that is not delivering so far enough. We need much less red tape. Wherever possible, we should make it more simple by transforming directives into deregulation. We should make requirements more simplified. We should digitalise. But first and most importantly, we must finally deliver. Companies must feel that we care and we are progressing. The third: better support for the green transition. We delivered a good, clear, transparent environment, but we need to use the state support to make it happen quickly and more effectively. Support on the level of the EU is much better than 27 different policies of the Member States. Last but not least, foreign economic policy. First, we must make sure that we support free trade. At the same time, we must protect our companies against free trade. I believe we can deliver. It’s demanding, but we manage even more difficult troubles, so I hope we will be progressing very clearly.",PPE,2024-04-23,"2.

Irene Tinagli,"Madam President, in a changing geopolitical landscape, Europe must step up to compete with China and the US, we keep reminding ourselves of this. And we’ve been reminded by leaders like Draghi and Letta of the path forward: the necessity for increased investments at the European level, which implies a bigger budget and the fiscal capacity at the EU level – but these are needed to address the big challenges of our century, the ecological transition and the digital transformation. And these are elements we’ve started to work on, but we need to keep pushing on that. But in this scenario, however, we must not forget that the foundation upon which we can build competitiveness is represented by peace. Europe has thrived in the context of peace and stability that has enabled our path of economic and social development. And today, unfortunately, this context is no longer a given. So to be competitive, Europe must equip itself, not only with tools strictly of an economic nature, but also to defend peace and geopolitical stability, which can be stronger defence as a deterrent but also stronger European diplomacy worldwide.

As long as we drag our feet with developing, creating a real capital markets union, we’ll have to be satisfied with a long list of commendable but ineffective actions on the part of the European Union that we heard from Ursula von der Leyen.

Terry Reintke,"Madam President, dear colleagues, this is a moment of truth. A moment of truth for the climate, a moment of truth for our economy, a moment of truth for our security. Because we all know that the Green Deal is about climate action and energy transition, but it is also about global competitiveness, making our industry green, creating future-proof jobs, and it is about the question whether electric cars will be produced in China, in the US or here in the European Union. It is about our place in the world. It is about our independence. It is, indeed, about our security. And this security will only be strong if we do not repeat the mistakes of the past, not to run into dependencies from dictators again. Building Nord Stream 2 was a mistake from the beginning, trusting that Putin would not wage a bloody war against Ukraine and attack our democracies and way of life was a mistake. We wasted important years for the expansion of renewables, which make Europe strong and free. We are right now facing the hottest days and months on record, which cost lives and which costs our economies. And still, the EPP refuses to do what is needed for our climate, for our economies and for the European Union not to be left behind and leave production, for example, of electric cars to China. Colleagues, let us not make the same mistakes of the past again. We cannot lose time to make this continent climate neutral, especially while we are also facing times when democracy and freedom are under severe attack. And as it looks, also from within this House – after Russiagate, now there are new suspicions of espionage for China, also from assistants from this Parliament. And it has become absolutely clear, these people on the far right, they are not patriots, they are not serving the interests of the European citizens, but the interests of dictatorships and autocracies. This makes it even more important, colleagues, to build strong, pro-European, constructive majorities in the next European Parliament. After the European election, we will set a path for the next five years. The beginning of the next legislature will be our moment of truth. Will we steer the European Union in the direction of climate neutrality, of defending democracy and freedom? Or will we follow the same old recipes that risk harming our European economies and global competitiveness? I think you know the answer that I would give to that.

Manfred Weber,"Madam President, dear Madam President von der Leyen, dear colleagues, first of all I think we have to recognise that we cannot welcome the President of the European Council today. We speak about the outcome of an official European Council meeting last week in Brussels and the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, has obviously not the need to come to Strasbourg and explain to us as MEPs about the outcomes. So the Commission President is reporting, but not the Council President, so that’s why I would first of all generally underline that I see there a lack of respect towards this institution and I ask also our services to ask Charles Michel for clarification. What is the reasoning why he is not with us? I want to thank Ursula von der Leyen, because in the last five years she was a representative of the Commission, always being present in all debates here in this House, thank you so much, Ursula, for doing so. That, dear colleagues, is the last speech before we go into campaign, before we try to convince Europeans for our parties, but also in general for Europe, and you can imagine that for me as the EPP Group’s leader, it is a great thing that we discuss now competitiveness, because the EPP has been asking for this debate for years now about jobs, jobs, jobs. That was our EPP agenda over the last two or three years. Now it has arrived on the European level, on the European Council table. To be clear, competitiveness is not an empty word: it means preserving Europe’s more than 30 million jobs in manufacturing, creating new jobs like in the artificial intelligence field, it means empowering the 25 million SMEs in Europe to successfully lead Made in Europe into the future and it means also ensuring that 450 million European consumers receive good, safe and affordable products every day. When we speak about competitiveness, that is what we mean to underline the importance of this field. From a political point of view, I have to say yes, that on the European level the Council understood it from a party point of view. Let me also say that in the PES electoral programme, Iratxe, you never mention competitiveness with one single word there, so you can really see also from a party political point of view who has an idea about what is needed and who has no idea about what is needed. What do we have to do? We support the ideas presented by Ursula von der Leyen. The first thing is to strengthen our own market, the single market, the capital market union, services, energy. Also, the implementation of the current rules is an issue to strengthen our market, so we should not look to the outside world first of all, we should trust in our growth engine and that is our own single market. The second thing is innovation: not to allow that Horizon Europe be further watered down and cut. We need more money for innovation. We have to cut bureaucracy. This mandate was not a good one in this regard: we increased bureaucracy, it was driven by the thinking that a regulatory framework is better than having trust in those who are delivering on economic success stories. We want and stand for a Europe that creates opportunities and not a regulatory framework first of all. Finally, trade and not being naive in this world we are living in. When Olaf Scholz is in China and he is telling the Chinese that he has no problem with electric car production there, then for me that is quite naive, having in mind that 20 % of the cars sold in Europe last year are produced in China. They want to occupy this new market with their dumping approach. That is why we should be strong as Europeans, and we should be open for others for us to create a common market of the democracies in the world with Mercosur, with other agreements, this is the line to take. Ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues, for us this is in front of us when we speak also for preparing the next mandate: at the end of this mandate, before we go to elections, I want to underline that we all share one common understanding: to save democracy in Europe, to fight against those who are taking Europe, who are taking the democratic principles. My party, the European People’s Party, is a founding party of Europe with Adenauer, De Gasperi, Schuman. Today, people like Donald Tusk have this flag in their hands. So we do this together with a pro-European, pro-rule of law and pro-Ukraine approach. The campaign means to discuss things, but the starting point is that we delivered. We delivered together with Brexit, with the vaccines, with the RRF, with the Green Deal, migration and digital, the list is long. We did it together, and we did it together under the lead of Ursula von der Leyen as Commission President. So let us be proud about this and let us then have a good campaign where we show Europeans the alternatives in front of us.",PPE,2024-04-23,"2.

The disproportionate response by the Israeli authorities has led to the destruction of Gaza and the loss of countless of innocent lives, including women and children. This cannot be justified under any circumstances. Defence has been replaced by vengeance, and humanity replaced by callousness. In Aleppo, we saw entire neighbourhoods levelled. Putin continued his disregard for human life again in Ukraine. How is the indiscriminate bombing in Gaza any different? Netanyahu and his government seem hell-bent on destroying not just the lives of Palestinians, but also everything that makes up Palestine. The horrifying discovery of mass graves at Nasser Hospital may just be the tip of the iceberg. We must halt this madness and halt this endless cycle of destruction. We need a ceasefire, and we need it now. Ireland and Spain asked the Commission in mid-February to examine whether Israel is respecting its human rights obligations in the EU-Israel Association Agreement. Why has the Commission done nothing about this request? Why the silence? Netanyahu has turned his back on the international community, and I speak for many of my constituents when I say that the EU cannot be complicit in Israel’s disregard for innocent lives.

Evin Incir,"Mr President, colleagues, after more than three decades of dedicated and continuous fight for women’s rights by European women, we are on the brink of achieving a new milestone in the history of women in Europe. The journey has been challenging, but every moment of anger and every tear shed along the way have been worthwhile. While the negotiation process has taken over two years, the battle for our rights and demands has been ongoing for much, much longer. The pleas from women and girls resonate throughout our Union, spanning all our Member States and reaching across the globe. Though their voices may vary, their message remains consistent: a call for freedom, safety, security and the protection of women’s human rights. No corner in our society is immune to the threat of gender-based violence. Whether it is in homes, schools, workplaces, public squares, streets or online platforms, women and girls are continually subjected to violence and abuse at the hands of men. It has occurred throughout history and in all parts of society, whether during times of war or during times of peace. Close to one out of every three women has experienced physical and/or sexual violence since the age of 15. Approximately 5% of women in EU countries have been raped since the age of 15. Shockingly, only 0.5% of rapes result in convictions. This is unacceptable. We must put an end to this impunity. Globally, intimate partners are responsible for up to 38% of all murders of women. Between 45% and 55% of women in the EU have encountered sexual harassment since the age of 15. However, this issue extends beyond personal relationships and infiltrates various settings, including online platforms. Online violence against women and girls has surged in recent years, presenting significant threats to their safety and wellbeing. For example, 73% of female journalists have faced online violence in the course of their work. As I eagerly anticipate finally being able to transition from words to action to save the lives of women and girls, I am also disheartened by certain leaders in some of our Member States, particularly the trio of men who hindered the inclusion of legislation based on consent to address rape. The actions of the liberal President Macron in France, the liberal Minister of Justice Buschmann in Germany – who disregarded the pleas of his ministerial counterparts from the Social Democratic Party and the Green Party to incorporate legislation based on consent to address rape – and the illiberal Prime Minister Viktor Orbán of Hungary are deeply disappointing. Your betrayal and obstruction of the opportunity to implement consent-based legislation will not be overlooked and will not be forgotten. Nevertheless, despite the resistance from these three individuals and others, we succeeded in incorporating for the first time in EU legislation the requirement for Member States to promote a culture based on consent in sexual relationships, to define non-consensual sex as a criminal offence. While this may not seem ground-breaking at first glance, the challenges faced during negotiations have revealed its truly strong and revolutionary nature. Colleagues, let’s pay attention to the request of the various European and national women’s organisation. It’s time to finalise – through adoption of the agreement – and embrace this historical and ground-breaking first directive aimed at combating violence against women and domestic violence in a comprehensive way. At this point, any indecision would be a betrayal of the collective efforts, aspirations and dedication of generations of women and girls. Remember: the rights of women and girls are human rights. Let’s now go from words to actions for a more secure Europe for women and girls, for a feminist Europe.",S&D,2024-04-23,7.

Agnes Jongerius,"Madam President, there are still right-wing conservatives who are still focussed on this old-fashioned narrative of the trickle-down economy at the cost of people, which has been debunked already for years. But luckily, I have to say there is a new wind blowing in Europe and last week was the proof of it. In La Hulpe we signed the declaration that sets the social agenda for the upcoming years, calling to promote collective bargaining in public procurement. A few days later, Enrico Letta presented his report to the European Council, where he argues that the internal market cannot flourish without the essential social values integrated in it. Competitiveness is not just about the lowest prices, it is also about upholding social values and high quality jobs. In order to break this downward spiral of the market at the cost of people, we need to revise our public procurement directives so the money works for the interests of the citizens.",S&D,2024-04-23,"2.

Helena Dalli,"Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for inviting me to today’s debate. From the beginning of our mandate, the Commission emphasised its strong commitment to advance gender equality and to ensure freedom from gender-based violence in its equality strategy. In this respect, the European Parliament has been very vocal – and I really, really thank you for this – in calling on the Commission to take legislative action to end violence against women. Again, I thank you for your perseverance and for your active support. In particular, I thank the co-rapporteurs, Members of Parliament Fitzgerald and Incir and your teams for your unrelenting commitment to this file and in making a difference and contributing to changing women’s lives. The work exchanges and negotiations with stakeholders, civil society organisations, Member States and EU, Swedish, Spanish and Belgian Presidencies have been intense and sometimes difficult and challenging. But through our common efforts and common aim to have for the first time EU law to protect, prevent and support women against violence and domestic violence, we managed to reach a political agreement on this instrument earlier this year. The message is clear. No longer will we accept violence against women and domestic violence in Europe. The directive represents an important step towards promoting change in social and cultural patterns of behaviour, and ultimately reducing the prevalence of all forms of violence against women and domestic violence in the EU. Victims of violence against women and domestic violence across the EU will now benefit from the same measures of protection, support and access to justice. The directive builds upon and complements the general regime of the Victims Rights Directive by introducing provisions targeted to the specific needs of victims of violence against women and domestic violence. The directive also provides for the EU-wide criminalisation of the most widespread forms of cyber violence against women, non-consensual sharing of intimate images, cyberstalking, cyber harassment, misogynous hate speech online and cyber flashing. It also criminalises female genital mutilation and forced marriage as such harmful practices are unacceptable. The directive will include a strong article on prevention measures related to rape and the central role of consent in sexual relationships to promote awareness and ultimately reduce the scourge of rape in the EU. Member States have three years to implement the directive. It will require every Member State’s commitment to correctly transpose the new law within that time frame. The Commission will support Member States and closely monitor that process. I trust that this House, together with the Council, will adopt this directive in order to empower victims and help make Europe a safe place for us.",-,2024-04-23,7.

Helena Dalli,"Madam President, with regards to the question posed by the honourable Elena Lizzi about collection of data on employees with disabilities in our institutions, under applicable rules, the Human Resources departments are not informed of employees disabilities unless the employee concerned voluntarily provides the information. So this, of course, then results in a lack of sufficient data, as pointed out by the European Court of Auditors. I want to thank you for your cooperation on this very important file, and this directive will ensure easier recognition of disability status and equal access to special conditions and preferential treatment across the EU. With them, the EU delivers significant and tangible improvements, I would say, in the life of persons with disabilities. The most important measures announced in the strategy for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities will have been executed by the end of 2024. So I am glad that I could count on you to advance on our objective of getting closer to this reality of a Union of equality. I also want to take advantage of this debate to thank you all.

Malin Björk,"Mr President, I want to thank the rapporteurs and I also want to acknowledge that this directive is feminist teamwork. And when I say ‘feminist teamwork’, it’s also the women that came before us who have tirelessly asked for European action to combat violence against women and gender-based violence, and now we are here. We will have a directive against violence against women and domestic violence. Violence against women and girls and gender-based violence has no place in Europe in 2024. It limits all our lives. It takes lives and we must combat it together. But as you know, as all feminists know, this is not only a question of law enforcement, it is a feminist project, it is actually a very long feminist project. That’s why I’m very happy that this directive has strong parts on prevention, on supporting women’s shelters, on supporting women and men and boys that fight violence against women and girls. It has strong provisions on rights for victims, because if we do not have access to justice and access to support and protection for victims, then we’re not doing our feminist job. We have mentioned LBGTIQ+ women as well as they are also victims of gender-based violence.

Measures that the State of Israel is obliged to follow. This House is not a court, but we can all see it. The ICJ has seen it. What is the world doing about it? What are we doing about it?

Andrius Kubilius,"Madam President, dear colleagues, despite all the tragic pictures from the region, we need not to forget that the main problem in the region is terrorism: Hamas, Hezbollah, ISIS, Iran. The fight against terrorism, which is occupying cities and regions, always was bloody. Let’s compare liberation of Mosul in 2017 and situation in Gaza today. Mosul city had up to 12 000 ISIS terrorists, which were fighting against liberation of the city by American-led coalition. Liberation took 10 months, the city was destroyed by heavy bombing, up to 40 000 civilians were killed. Today, Hamas has up to 40 000 active fighters in Gaza. Numbers of casualties during liberation of Gaza are not very different from the numbers in Mosul. Liberation of Mosul was welcomed by all the western democratic world. If somebody knows how to avoid civilian casualties in the battles against terrorists who are occupying big cities, tell us. The victory in such a battle is needed not only for security of Israel, but also for the future of Palestinian people. In order to create the proper future for Palestinian people, first of all, the security of Israel should be guaranteed. That is why terrorism needs to be defeated. The Abraham Accords, guaranteeing mutual security and development, need to be signed, and Palestinian Arabs need to be helped to heal from paradigm of terrorism and influence of Iran. And only then, with the help of a secure Israel, we shall be able to assist the Palestinians in developing their ability to govern themselves.

Barry Andrews,"Madam President, High Representative and colleagues, the Colonna report states that the Government of Israel provided no evidence to support its claim that UNRWA staff were members of Hamas. Nevertheless, these claims led to an avalanche of condemnation of UNRWA by EU Member States, an avalanche of calls to suspend funding of UNRWA, regardless – it seems – of either the devastating humanitarian consequences or the absence of evidence. And if it’s never the wrong time to do the right thing, then the right thing for Austria, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Romania and Sweden is to acknowledge that suspension was a mistake and that UNRWA is indispensable. To make matters worse, the US Congress last week passed a bill providing USD 26 billion in support to Israel and banning aid to UNRWA until 2025. It’s difficult not to lose faith in the face of these circumstances, but as this will be my last speech on this issue – in this mandate at least – let me express my pride in the approach of the Irish Government: increasing aid to UNRWA, recognising Palestine and calling for a review of the EU-Israel Association Agreement.",Renew,2024-04-23,"10.

Jordi Solé,"Madam President, the tragedy of Gaza seems to have no end. Just when it looks impossible for the suffering of Palestinians to increase, reality grounds us with children killed in a playground or with mass graves and the razed hospitals. No, the terrible massacre of 7 October should never have happened, and neither should the carnage in Gaza, a disproportionate response that may amount to an unlawful collective punishment. We have seen in horror how aid workers have been targeted and killed by the IDF, how desperate citizens trying to collect something to eat were gunned down, how more than 100 journalists were assassinated, how indiscriminate bombings caused massacres of innocent civilians and unprecedented destruction. We have seen severe restrictions on humanitarian aid that deprive civilians of what they need to survive, putting them on the brink of famine. International law and international humanitarian law have been trampled upon. No, Hamas atrocity atrocities can never be justified: it was a horrendous terrorist crime. But Israel’s conduct is unacceptable. International justice will have to rule on the possible war crimes committed by all the parties, and perpetrators will have to be held to account. The only way to truly weaken Hamas and ensure Israel’s long-term security is by granting the two peoples, Israelis and Palestinians, the right to have their country. By neglecting the conflict while keeping going with the occupation, today Israelis have less security and Palestinians less hope.

Antonio López-Istúriz White,"Madam President, the tragic events when seven staff members of the World Central Kitchen were killed by an Israeli strike are regrettable and unacceptable. The distinction that we have to make is the reaction. Whereas Hamas and Hezbollah terrorist attacks butcher innocent civilians and show absolutely no regret, a democratic country, Israel, which is fighting a difficult war to neutralise terrorist groups and recover their abducted civilians, shows accountability and regret. Israel admitted its terrible mistake. It carried out an investigation that showed that the officers in charge of the strike were convinced that the cars were being used by Hamas, something that happens often. It dismissed and reprimanded officers involved in the operation. This will, of course, not bring back those who tragically lost their lives. But at least we know clearly what happened, and hopefully a similar tragic mistake like this will not happen again. This is what democracies do. The attempt of many to use this episode to argue that Israel is deliberately targeting workers of these organisations, like those who easily use the word genocide, are wrong, irresponsible and shameful. What we do not know, or if there are any regrets or investigation, is after the bombing by Islamic Jihad of a hospital at the beginning of the war. Hundreds died. Where is the investigation? Where is the regret? Abuse, rape and torture of Israeli women – where is the investigation? Where is the regret? I have not heard anything, here also in this Parliament, from many. What we do not know is where hundreds of hostages are. I think that we should focus on what we can do to reduce suffering in the Middle East. This will not happen only by accusing Israel of being a genocidal country who is deliberately killing aid workers. It is not true.",PPE,2024-04-23,"10.

Josep Borrell Fontelles,"Madam President, Excellencies, more than six months after the Hamas terrorist attack that we continue condemning in the strongest possible terms, the war started in Gaza. This is a watershed moment for the Middle East. We had yesterday the meeting with the Gulf countries, and this was very high on our agenda. The recent Iranian strike on Israel was also a clear escalatory attack. But we must not forget, at the same time, the gravity of human suffering in Gaza. The figures are there. More than 34 000 people killed, mostly civilian women, children. Twice this number wounded. 75 % of the population displaced, on the brink of famine. We know that dozens of children have already been starved to death. The cities in Gaza have been more destroyed than the German cities during the Second World War – just imagine the comparison. A recent interim damage assessment by the World Bank and by the United Nations, supported financially by the European Union, assessed the direct damage to be about 19 billion – this will be the cost of rebuilding the infrastructure of Gaza the way it was at the end of January, so imagine now much worse. We can say that more than 60 % of the physical infrastructure has been damaged and 35 % fully destroyed. At least 249 aid workers have been killed – I’m talking about aid workers – according to the United Nations, since 7 October, among them 181 United Nations staff. And I think that we have to pay tribute to all eight agencies, including UNRWA, which alone has lost 178 employees. Then come these Israeli strikes against the convoy of the World Central Kitchen that killed 7 humanitarian workers while they were delivering aid to the most vulnerable in Gaza. But keep in mind, we were very moved by these 7 people being killed, but before them there were 249 also killed. And maybe we were not as moved. And people around the world say, yes, that’s very bad. These 7 humanitarian workers deserve all our homage, but keep in mind that together they were 249 more. Together with Commissioner Lenarčič, we publicly call for a credible investigation. We are also appalled by the number of journalists and media workers which has been killed by the strike in Gaza. About 100 journalists and media workers, as Reporters Without Borders recount, in less than six months. This is unprecedented. Journalists are civilians and their voices are crucial to keeping this information at bay and citizens being informed. And we are also concerned about the newly adopted legislation giving temporary power to the Israeli Government to prevent foreign media networks from operating in Israel. This, coupled with the lack of access to foreign media to Gaza, raises further concern about what we know about what’s going on there. We have to repeat once again that Israel must respect international law, implement the International Court of Justice provisional measures, ensure the protection of all civilians, allow humanitarian workers to do their lifesaving job without being targeted. For the first time, the Israeli Defence Forces recognises that it was a dramatic error, that it was a mistake, the killing of these humanitarian workers. The question is: how many mistakes have been happening before without being recognised? We insist on the fact that journalists have to be protected, and on granting access to Gaza to ensure the freedom of press. The European Union Council has insisted – and I am here representing the common ground of all Member States, in line with the conclusions of the European Union Council – that an immediate humanitarian pause leading to a sustainable ceasefire, the unconditional release of hostages and the provision of humanitarian assistance are the guidelines of the European Union, as decided by the European Council on 17 April 2024. But we have to do more and ask everybody to do more to protect civilians and alleviate a humanitarian catastrophe by increasing the flow of humanitarian aid, which is not an impediment, which is not an obstacle. Yes, there are obstacles. And yesterday, my colleague Lenarčič was explaining the number of conditions that this aid has to fulfil in order to be allowed to come into Gaza. We need more access by land roads, more access points. The recent decision by Israel to open the Ashdod port and the Erez crossing point is positive news, but they have to be implemented – it is not a matter of announcing, it is a matter of doing. And at the time being, it is being done at a very slow pace and in very low quantity. This is a fact. Quicker checks and better distribution remains crucial to alleviate people’s suffering. And it’s crucial for Israel to comply with the United Nations Security Council binding Resolution 2728, demanding full humanitarian access. And on that, also, the Europeans are fully behind. Finally, a ground operation in Rafah must be avoided. There are more than 1.3 million people on the streets of Rafah with no more shelter than a piece of plastic over their heads. And humanitarian consequences would be catastrophic. Everybody is saying that – the US, the European Union, Member States. We insisted in the G7. We insisted in the Foreign Affairs Council. Let us say that this is not going to happen. And then we have to say that the work of UNRWA has to be supported. And yesterday the former Minister Catherine Colonna report that Secretary-General Guterres tasked her to do was issued. And I think that it’s important to read this report. It is important to know what this very independent and very professional group of people have been studying and what they tell us. I think there is a strong convergence of views between the analysis and recommendation of this independent review group with the measures that we have been discussing at the European Union institutions. We are now waiting to see how we continue our cooperation with UNRWA, because what the report says is that they haven’t found any proof of the accusations against some workers of UNRWA. And that, yes, there are some problems of political neutrality. But this is one thing. And another thing is to participate in the terrorist attacks of 7 October. We welcome the UNRWA cooperation and, as Minister Colonna said, it is an irreplaceable safety line for hundreds of thousands of people. Calling the international community to fund UNRWA in order to allow this institution to continue their work. I have to pay tribute to the 7 humanitarian workers killed when they were working for the World Central Kitchen, but also to the 249 people who were killed before. I have to pay tribute to all the victims of the Hamas attack and the Israeli army against Gaza. To more than 100 journalists and media reporters. And we have to ask for this tragedy to end. And I repeat, the European Union Council asked for the implementation of the United Nations resolutions, asked for immediate release of the hostages, asked for more access for humanitarian support, asked for a humanitarian pause that brings about a permanent ceasefire and, most importantly, asked to look for a political solution. We cannot say this is just a humanitarian problem – it is, and it has to be immediately faced – but it is a political problem. And we have to join our forces, as we agreed to do yesterday with the Gulf countries, in order to look for a political solution that can only be based, I believe, we believe at the European Union, on the two-state solution. And if there is someone who doesn’t believe in that solution, then they have to tell us which is the alternative. You don’t want the Palestinians to have their own state, in order to live in peace and security side-by-side with Israel? You don’t want this solution? Then you have to tell the international community which other solution you have in mind in order to ensure peace, prosperity and security for these two peoples that for too many years have been fighting for the same land. We condemn all terrorist activities, but we want humanitarian law to be respected and we want the hostilities to stop, humanitarian support to come in, the hostages to be released and a political process to be put in place in order to look for a political solution to this dramatic war.",-,2024-04-23,"10.

Ursula von der Leyen,"Madam President, honourable Members, thank you very much. Indeed, competitiveness was the topic of the European Council and leaders taking the floor recalled that, since the last European elections, our union has really weathered two a crisis of historic proportions. The COVID-19 health crisis and the war in Ukraine, with a ‘made-in-Russia’ energy crisis. They could have turned into a dramatic economic and social crisis, but they didn’t. And this was because of Europe’s great resilience, but also because we put the right policies in place. Think of SURE. SURE saved 40 million European jobs. Or think of NextGenerationEU and REPowerEU, which fast-tracked the recovery and deployment of home-grown renewables. I have not forgotten that, in 2020, many predicted mass unemployment in Europe and long recession. It did not happen because we put the right policies in place and we acted decisively. Instead, today we have more people in work than at any other time in European history. Unemployment is at an all-time low, at less than 6 %. Employment is at an all-time high, at over 75 %. And inflation is now close to our 2 % target. So dear colleagues, we have gone certainly through hell and high water. But in many respects we have come out stronger than five years ago. Yet the shockwaves of these crises have taken a toll on Europe’s competitiveness. The business model of many European industries was based on supposedly cheap energy from Russia and trade with a growing China. Today, we face a rogue Russia and a China struggling with domestic demand. And besides geopolitics, there are other trends that are impacting our competitiveness. In the last decade, Europe’s labour productivity has risen by only 0.8 % per year, compared with 1.1 % in the United States. These trends can only be addressed with a concerted effort at both European and national level. Therefore, restoring our competitive edge must be at the heart of Europe’s economic agenda in 2024 and beyond. And I am absolutely convinced that with the necessary push, we can set off a new surge of European competitiveness. At the European Council of last week, we listened to some very good ideas from Enrico Letta on our Single Market. Today, I want to look at four of the basic factors that determine costs, prices and productivity in Europe. Let me start with finance. Since we took office almost five years ago, we have unleashed an unprecedented wave of public investment in strategic sectors. Take energy and clean tech. We are investing EUR 400 billion from NextGenerationEU, and we have approved over EUR 550 billion in national public support, for clean tech and energy investment. This has been crucial. But certainly public investment is not enough. The time has come for a systemic solution that mobilises Europe’s immense private capital. And an essential part of this solution is to complete the Capital Markets Union. EUR 470 billion – this is the additional private investment we could raise every year if we completed the Capital Markets Union – EUR 470 billion! The Capital Markets Union, ‘the CMU’, was launched almost ten years ago. And since the start of the mandate, we have made progress on many of its elements. For instance, we have made it easier for companies across Europe, especially SMEs, to get listed on capital markets. But we have also faced a deadlock in Council, on many crucial aspects of the CMU. So, it is more than welcome that the last European Council marks a turning point, finally. We now have a clear mandate to move forward on three vital issues. First: harmonising national rules on topics like insolvency. This will give investors the predictability they need. Second: We will design and create cross-border savings products for retail investors. And third: The Commission has been tasked to strengthen supervision at European level of the most important market players. So the way forward is clear. If we are to fund the new industrial revolution of our times, we must mobilise Europe’s private capital. And now is the time to turn the political will into action. The second priority is reducing the cost of energy. Energy costs continue to affect our competitiveness, especially for energy-intensive industries. The International Energy Agency tells us that there might be some relief in sight. You remember very well that, last year, during the energy crisis, many investments have been done. A large wave of new LNG export projects is coming to the market. And therefore we might soon be moving from a global shortfall of LNG to an abundance of LNG. As a result, we expect gas prices to decrease, to fall. This gives us space to further develop renewable energies. And I think it is a very telling success that last year for the very first time the European Union was able to produce more electricity from wind than it did from gas. This was a big success. At this point, I want to thank Parliament, for all the work you have done, the work for example on the reform of the electricity market or the new Renewable Energy Directive. We must keep pushing to produce more cheap and clean energy in Europe. And we must listen to our industries, what they need to reach the climate goals. We have done in so-called Clean Transition Dialogues with ten different industrial sectors. One of their central demands is always energy infrastructure. In our decade now, our cross-border electricity transmission capacity must double. So, this needs investments in smart grids and charging infrastructure, but also cables, pipes, turbines and electrolysers. You just name it. We must build the physical backbone of the economy of the future in order to be competitive. The third priority is to address the labour and skills shortage that affects our economy and it’s obvious. We have, as I said, very low unemployment, so we need to train as many as possible of our unemployed, specifically have a look at youth unemployment, because, as I said, we have very low unemployment on average – we have higher youth unemployment than average – and every young person has great potential, even if they might be struggling with obstacles of all kinds. Let us make sure that they get the chance they deserve. We also have to increase women’s access to the labour market. Parents need infrastructure, it’s very simple. Affordable and accessible childcare, good schools and flexible working hours are an absolute must. Finally, we can offer more flexible solutions for silver workers to continue their careers, and we need to attract the right talents from abroad. So it’s a whole bundle of activities that have to be done to address the skills shortage. We are investing EUR 65 billion in skills, through NextGenerationEU and the European Social Fund, and skills must continue to be at the heart of our action. Finally, let us never forget that Europe is a trading continent, and we derive a significant share of our prosperity from trade. If it is true that in the next decade 90 % of the most significant growth is happening in regions outside the European Union, well we should tap into it. Our Union is second to none in negotiating trade deals. We have the largest network of trade agreements in the world, with a total of 74 countries. The value of EU trade through these agreements surpassed EUR 2 trillion for the first time in 2022. And beyond exports, we need to secure imports, for example, of the critical raw materials that our industry needs. But, honourable Members, trade also needs to be fair. We need a global level playing field. And we need to address the risks that come with our openness. We need for example tools to address issues of overcapacity that is produced outside the European Union. I am speaking about structural overproduction, an overproduction that is achieved to a large extent by subsidies, massive subsidies. This overproduction has to go somewhere. Others are closing their markets. So our market is an attractive destination and we have to be very vigilant that our producers are not at risk to be forced out of the market. And we also need to involve developing economies around the world on this topic, because their industrialisation is also threatened directly by overcapacity. We need a more structural response with our partners and work on this is starting in the G7. Honourable Members, the last five years have taught us something. Time and again, we have surprised the sceptics, and defied the doomsayers. Because for a strong Europe, if there is a will, there is a way. And our continent will continue to be the global beating heart of industry and innovation. Thank you, and long live Europe.",-,2024-04-23,"2.

Barry Andrews,"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, colleagues, last Friday, I had the honour of meeting with the Disability Federation of Ireland and being the first politician to sign their disability pledge. This commitment, on my part, signifies prioritising disability issues and actively working in Parliament on equality and inclusion. The Disability Federation of Ireland welcomed the European Disability Card, but they stressed that it is not enough, it is just a start. We must fulfil the EU strategy on the rights of persons with disabilities. We must improve electoral accessibility to ensure disabled participation in EU politics and, most importantly, to ensure full accessibility and freedom of movement across the EU through legislation. However, like many other marginalised groups in our society, people with disabilities are fearful of the rise in right-wing populism and what the next mandate may bring. They stressed to me that continuity in the next mandate is vital for people with disabilities. So, as they need representatives who will uphold their rights, people with disabilities tell me that they need the European Union, there is no other regional political entity in the world that stands up for people with disabilities in the way that the European Union does.",Renew,2024-04-23,8.

I reiterate my sincere gratitude to the honourable Members of Parliament for your continued support and determination to combat gender-based discrimination. Thank you again Evin – who is here – Frances Fitzgerald and Rosa, your commitment to gender equality has been invaluable in the negotiations on this file. Together, we have delivered on a key commitment in the 2020-2025 Gender Equality Strategy to advance gender equality and to ensure women and girls across Europe can live their lives free from gender-based violence. I want to underline once more the added value of this directive and take a look at what we have achieved: a comprehensive set of measures of protection, support and access to justice applicable to victims wherever they live, travel, work or study – measures which are tailored to the specific needs of victims of violence against women. There is also the EU-wide criminalisation of the most widespread forms of cyber violence – which is an urgent issue to address given the exponential spread and dramatic impact of violence online – and the strong and encompassing measures of prevention, including specific measures for the prevention of rape and the promotion of the central role of consent in sexual relationships. Against this background, I invite all Members to support this much-needed directive. We owe it to the victims of violence against women across the EU to act now and to improve their plight.

We must never get used to this or be too proud of what we have achieved, because this is one step ahead and there is still so much to do. I speak today as a politician, but above all as a woman and as a mother. We all know that this is good, but that it is not enough. Sex without consent is a criminal offence. Do you realise that we live in a Europe where we still have to fight for a sentence like this in a legislation? Dear colleagues, I will vote for the directive tomorrow, the first-ever step towards justice and freedom for women against violence. But let’s agree to that one last big thing: there is still much to do and this is only a work in progress. As mothers, as lawmakers, we have gotten a lot from the past.

Helena Dalli,"Mr President, thank you honourable Members and the rapporteurs for the two directives, Lucia Nicholsonová, Antonius Manders and Alice Kuhnke, and to all shadow rapporteurs. Thank you very much. I also acknowledge the important contribution of the late Eric Bergkvist, rapporteur for the TRAN Committee, and express my condolences to those close to him. The commitment of the Council and the Spanish and Belgian Presidencies to this file has been, I would say, unwavering. These two directives deliver on one of the flagship initiatives of the Strategy for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The first directive establishes the European Disability Card, as proof of a disability status or proof of entitlement to specific services based on disability, an improved European Parking Card for persons with disabilities as proof of the right to parking conditions and facilities reserved for persons with disabilities. The second directive will ensure that third country nationals legally residing in a Member State whose disability status has been recognised by that Member State, will also be able to use the cards. These cards will be recognised throughout the EU and the Commission welcomes the provisional agreements as balanced, but also ambitious. This mutual recognition will contribute to social inclusion and to implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The cards will facilitate the free movement of persons with disabilities, and have a direct impact on the lives of persons with disabilities in the European Union. They will ensure legal certainty that a person’s disability status will be recognised when travelling in the EU. The directives will also grant persons with disabilities access to special conditions and preferential treatment with respect to a large variety of services, activities and facilities. They will improve the situation of persons with disabilities when travelling to, or visiting, other Member States in the context of a short stay. The compromise text also takes into account the specific situation of students and other participants of mobility programmes. I welcome that the co-legislators were able to agree that the European Disability Card will be issued free of charge. No one should be deterred from obtaining a card. Finally, the reporting obligation will include an analysis of specific situations resulting from intersectional discrimination and an assessment on any remaining gaps relating to the free movement of persons with disabilities. That assessment will be considered when deciding whether further action at Union level is required to address any such gaps. The Commission remains committed to improve living conditions of persons with disabilities, and your continued support in achieving that objective has been invaluable during this Parliament’s mandate.",-,2024-04-23,8.

Barry Andrews,"Mr President, Commissioner and colleagues, discrimination is where human rights cannot be enjoyed to the full, and if we continue to accept the idea that women are less safe than men on our streets, on our trains, in nightclubs, then we accept discrimination and we accept human rights abuses, and we accept second-class status for women. Women fear public transport and dark streets and prepare defensive postures with headphones, looking over their shoulders. This is the learned behaviour generated by a society that doesn’t truly value women’s safety. In my work on the FEMM Committee, I was happy to support this directive. I very much welcome, also, the announcement by the Irish Taoiseach of a special task force on safety in Dublin. There should be a women’s safety adviser in this task force with expertise on safety for women in public places. In addition, a dedicated transport police is a critical element of addressing this discrimination.

Lívia Járóka,"Dear Colleagues! Congratulations to the rapporteurs, they have had their work cut out for them to establish such a report that provides a strong legal basis for the protection of women and all victims of domestic violence and reached a compromise that is in line with most Member States legal systems with leaving our differing ideologies out of the conversation. Studies have identified five main barriers to assistance for women from marginalised Roma communities who are experiencing domestic violence. These are (1) prejudice and discrimination, (2) downplaying and secondary victimisation by professionals, (3) unawareness of assistance opportunities among Roma, (4) inaccessibility of specialised services for victims of domestic violence, (5) and, finally, multiple marginalisation of Roma women caused by poverty, community pressure, long-term unemployment, geographical isolation, and low standard of living. This agreement addresses most if not all of these areas. Recent events in Hungary have proved we still have a long way to go, but I believe that with this Directive we can take a stand, protect women and all victims of domestic violence.",NI,2024-04-23,7.

Alice Kuhnke,"Mr President, I hope you would agree that the EU is only socially just once we ensure access to rights and opportunities for all without discrimination. This week, I hope we will take a major step towards achieving this. With these two proposals, establishing the European Disability Card and the European Parking Card for persons with disabilities, we now have the chance to adopt measures that will have a significant impact in improving the lives and facilitating the mobility of persons with disabilities across the EU. For years, civil society as well as politicians have been calling for increased efforts to ensure and secure the rights to free movement and mobility for persons with disabilities. The mutual recognition of disability status is a long awaited step to increase access to rights, combat discrimination and promote diversity across the EU. And this is why the introduction of both these cards is so important. The right to free movement applies to all EU citizens equally, but can also apply to non-EU citizens legally residing in a Member State. As the rapporteur, together with Mr Mendes for the directive extending the main directive to third-country nationals legally residing in a Member State, I am proud to have negotiated an agreement that will have a significant impact on the possibility for thousands of European residents to fully enjoy their right to experience everything that the EU has to offer. However, this is only the beginning. These proposals will not solve all of the current problems. Persons with disabilities face many barriers when travelling between Member States, and not all of them will be addressed through these new measures. This week we will make progress. But as legislators, we must continue our work to abolish all barriers for persons with disabilities, to freely move and to fill in the gaps in EU legislation that still persists. The fight for equal rights is a fight for inclusive societies that are able to accommodate the needs of Union citizens and residents in all of their diversity.

Martin Hojsík,"Mr President, dear colleagues, one in three women have experienced physical or sexual violence in their lifetime. Women make up the overwhelming majority of the victims of the crime of intimate partner abuse and of serious threats, rape and sexual violence. Every week, we read about horrific stories of women being abused or murdered by someone close to them, but some politicians still refuse to accept the term ‘gender-based violence’. We have to stop excusing these crimes, we have to stop pretending they don’t exist. We have to not only condemn them, but we have to address them, prevent them, and punish those who perpetrate them. This legislation is not ideal, but it is a significant step forward for countries that have not ratified, sadly, the Istanbul Convention, like my own Slovakia. We will need to properly collect data – which is currently lacking – to create effective policies. We need trained police officers, prosecutors, judges and we need to increase victims’ trust in law enforcement and authorities because experts estimate that only one tenth of the victims report sexual violence. Dear women, please accept my apology that this law is so belated. But I promise that many men and I are with you in this fight.

Martine Kemp,"Madam President, dear colleagues, for too long we have been turning a blind eye to the suffering of countless individuals who are forced to toil in deplorable conditions, often for little to no pay. The bitter reality is that, by allowing products produced through forced labour available in or exported from the European Union, we are being complicit in this injustice. By undermining the efforts of ethical businesses that strive to uphold labour standards and human rights, we are sending the message that exploitation and abuse are acceptable as long as they lead to cheap goods. I believe none of us present in this Chamber agrees with this. What we agree on, though, is that the European Union leads by example, always standing up for the values that we hold dear: freedom, dignity and justice for all. To this effect, with this regulation we are clearly stating that products made with forced labour will not be tolerated in any form, and that those who engage in it will face consequences. In this regard, I personally celebrate the balanced, solid and fair agreement reached: Balanced, because it is developed on a risk-based approach, focusing our efforts on the most severe cases. Solid, as it does not only maintain the possibility for the Commission to carry out field inspections even in and outside of Europe, but includes a stronger and more explicit non-cooperation clause as well. Fair, since it ensures a level playing field for our SMEs that shape the very basis of our economy and who are so often overburdened by new regulations. For all these reasons, with this agreement we are sending a strong signal of solid commitment to the principles and values that characterise and differentiate us in the international sphere, while ensuring our strategic autonomy by strengthening the competitiveness of our SMEs.

Miriam Lexmann,"Madam President, according to the ILO, on any given day in 2021, there were 27.6 million people used as forced labour. In the Chinese province of Xinjiang, around 1.5 million people have been sent to concentration camps. Millions believed to be used as forced labour in making different products that end up on our markets, from cotton to solar panels. For too long, we ignore these facts, thus becoming morally complicit in these crimes. This is why I welcome both the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive and the ban on products made with forced labour. I particularly welcome the risk-based approach so that our efforts can focus particularly on high-risk sectors and geographical areas, especially those like Xinjiang or Tibet, where State-imposed forced labour takes place. This way, we can also strike a balance between targeting the perpetrators and ensuring that our companies are not burdened by excessive administration. It is crucial that the ban hits those responsible for perpetrating and profiteering from abuses, rather than our small businesses. The new legislation is not perfect, especially after countless negotiations and compromises. It is, however, an important first step in ensuring that we stop profiteering from the suffering of others. Human dignity is and must always be our number one priority.",PPE,2024-04-22,19.

Mick Wallace,"Madam President, if we were to truly make repair available to everyone, it needs to be affordable, accessible and mainstream and protected from monopoly practices. The text of the provisional agreement goes a long way to addressing this concern. Manufacturers will be obliged to provide information on spare parts on their websites, and to make those spare parts available to all parties in the repair sector at a reasonable price. They will be prohibited from using contractual hardware or software barriers to repair, which is good news. However, we can still do much more to tackle consumption. Back in 2021, Parliament’s report on the circular economy action plan called on the Commission to propose targets to significantly reduce the EU’s material and consumption footprint by 2030 and bring them within planetary boundaries by 2050.

Unfortunately, we know this is not the case. It is estimated that around 50 million people around the world are living in modern slavery at any given time, and of these, over 27 million are trapped in forced labour. We may also think that these practices occur far away from us in Europe and have nothing to do with us. Unfortunately, this also isn’t the case. This forced labour often occurs in the value chains of international businesses operating in the EU. We must take strong action to put an end to these medieval practices.

Valdis Dombrovskis,"Madam President, honourable Members, first of all, I would like to thank the Parliament for organising this debate and for this opportunity to speak on this important legislative initiative: a proposal for a regulation to prohibit products made with forced labour on the Union market. The fight against forced labour is a political priority for this Commission. As forced labour continues to exist, and even grow, the European Union needs an effective tool to avoid that products made with forced labour are placed on the EU market. For example, the latest ILO report issued last month estimates the total illegal annual profits for forced labour at USD 236 billion. This is USD 64 billion more as compared to the previous estimate from a decade ago. Therefore, this measure is urgently needed to provide strong incentives for companies and governments to ensure respect for human rights and better labour protection, in line with international commitments taken by a large majority of countries, as well as to make sure that the economic operators produce products without using forced labour. We cannot allow companies to profit from forced labour by selling their products in the single market. The Commission welcomes the trial agreement, reached in early March by the European Parliament and the Council on the draft regulation, so I’d like to congratulate Parliament and especially the co-rapporteurs, Maria‑Manuel Leitão‑Marques and Samira Rafaela, for their remarkable work on this file. We expect that the agreed text will lead to a balanced and effective instrument based on elements included in a provisional agreement, such as close cooperation between Member States and the Commission, as well as implementation of a risk-based approach and the approach of state-imposed forced labour. The main change brought to the agreed text, compared with the initial Commission proposal, concerns the governance mechanism, which will result in the Commission taking a large majority of cases. This instrument will be only as strong and effective as the team implementing it so, going forward, we count on Parliament and the Council to assure that the Commission will have enough resources to be able to deliver for the Union and meet the objective of helping to eradicate forced labour and ban products made with forced labour from the Union market. The Commission has prepared a formal statement on financing of resources for the implementation of the regulation. The statement was sent to Parliament’s services for inclusion in the verbatim record of this debate. So let me thank Parliament again for your hard work throughout the negotiations on this file, and encourage you to endorse this instrument as provisionally agreed with the Council. Commission statement (in writing) “The European Commission notes that the final agreement reached by the co-legislators on the Regulation on prohibiting products made with forced labour on the Union market has evolved significantly in terms of the staff and resources required for its implementation by the Commission, compared to the legislative financial statement which accompanied the original proposal (COM(2022) 453 final of 14.09.2022), which was based on a decentralised model of implementation combined with support for implementation at EU level. The Commission recalls that, for the current MFF, the Commission is operating under the principle of stable staffing imposed by the budgetary authority, and – given the wide array of additional tasks that have been conferred upon the Union since the beginning of the MFF - it is already under severe constraints, making it difficult to cover even the existing tasks’ needs. There is no margin to finance additional officials or external staff. Therefore, any additional tasks conferred by the co-legislators upon the Commission shall be accompanied by corresponding resource reinforcements ensuring their effective implementation. In light of the above, the additional Commission human resources required by the final agreement endorsed by the co-legislators will not allow the Commission to respect the principle of stable staffing. This will require additional establishment plan posts and corresponding appropriations, to be authorised by the European Parliament and the Council during the annual budget procedure along with the related budgetary appropriations. Furthermore, the Commission will also propose, in the framework of the annual budgetary procedure, the creation of additional budget lines under the Single Market Programme, the Customs Programme or both, financed from the Programme’s available appropriations, in so far as allowed under the respective legal bases, as identified in the updated Legislative Financial Statement provided by the Commission, which will also be used to finance the Commission’s implementation of the Regulation beyond the limit of the principle of stable staffing. These new budget lines will cover the cost of contractual agents and other administrative expenditures of the Commission in implementing the Regulation, to be authorised by the European Parliament and the Council during the annual budget procedure.”",-,2024-04-22,19.

Samira Rafaela,"Madam President, the forced labour ban regulation resembles a grand marathon with many challenges along the way that made the journey both demanding and fulfilling. This regulation will be groundbreaking and unique. It is broad, inclusive and tackles many issues. The forced labour ban will put a halt to the entry of products and services produced under dire, inhumane and undignified circumstances. For too long, we have accepted products and services that are cheap, at the expense of societal consequences on the people involved in the production or supply chains. Almost 30 million people are working in inhumane conditions and slaved, sometimes for life, to produce goods and services exported around the world, notably to our markets. And 13 million victims are women and girls. Forced labour touches the very essence of gender inequality. We see women and girls placed in environments that set them back significantly in life, time and again. We see women and children imposed upon with reality that is ugly and unjust. Several companies earn altogether around USD 236 billion thanks to these practices over the back of the people. And I’m happy that many of you stood firm with us when we negotiated and demanded a comprehensive definition of remediation in the regulation. Even though some parties were immovable until the very end. I firmly believe and am convinced that mainstreaming, remediation and regulation will lead to transitional justice for victims. We have worked for decades in sweatshops, factories and other dire and dark circumstances to support unethical supply chains. The faces, names and stories shall be and must be recognised. The regulation will also ensure that we address not only forced labour, but also state imposed forced labour through a risk-based approach. This approach will enable European national authorities, along with the European Commission, to lead investigations into suspected cases of forced labour. The regulation will further enhance inter-European cooperation. Member States and their respective customs authorities will work together in the Union network with unified and facilitated access to comprehensive information on risk areas, products and gender aggregated data through the database and this will ease the work of authorities tasked with preventing products from entering the European market. This regulation is also a significant opportunity for our companies and SMEs. Together with the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, companies will be prepared to address the significant issues ahead of us, making them more resilient, competitive and real drivers of change. And the regulation will also democratise the way we trade with our partners, while placing human rights and responsible business conduct at the forefront. People, consumers and other organisations will now also be able to take initiative when they realise that products do not comply with the newly set norms and together with the authorities, they will help us tackle the serious issue of forced labour. It has been a true pleasure, a great honour and a privilege to serve in this House, and this sprint marks the end of my marathon. So I thank you very much for the cooperation and specifically towards my dear co-rapporteur Maria-Manuel Marquez. I am proud of what we do together in the EU and for each other, for intersectional policies and justice and for the people outside, around the world. And my final ask would be to vote in favour of this regulation tomorrow, and to the countries and partners watching, this is your moment to ratify ILO Protocol 29 to the Forced Labour Convention.",Renew,2024-04-22,19.

And this will continue unless we address that and other serious issues, such as costs, accessibility, and other barriers, like insurance. In Ireland, for example, a recent survey showed that only 11 % of people are aware of our national repair directory, repairmystuff.ie. So, we need a concerted boost, which could be a game changer for this sustainable, hidden part of the national economy. It would be supporting vocational training and small businesses.

Deirdre Clune,"Madam President, Commissioner, the right to repair – rather than the alternative to throw away or to replace something – that is going to be absolutely welcomed by consumers, not just because of a cost-saving measure, but also, importantly, because of the positive impact on our environment. It is estimated that EU consumers lose up to EUR 12 billion each year by opting to buy new goods instead of repairing, and the option to repair is not always available. This legislation will remove those obstacles by ensuring that products can be repaired within the legal guarantee, that consumers have easier and cheaper options to repair goods when the guarantee is expired, that strong provisions will be in place to ensure independent repairers can easily repair products without restrictions by the manufacturers. This will be supported by provisions to ensure affordable spare parts that are there available, that manufacturers must disclose repair details and offer spare parts and tools at fair prices. Consumer awareness is to be facilitated through a new European online repair system, allowing them to locate repair facilities in their own State. And, of course, another major benefit of this legislation must be the impact on our environment: less waste, less use of limited natural resources. The Commission figures tell us that 261 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions are generated each year by the loss of electronic waste, resulting in 35 million tonnes of waste in the EU every year. So this proposal will address those challenges, be a major contributor to our sustainability, to our circular economy, and ensure the consumers have more money in their pockets.",PPE,2024-04-22,18.

Ylva Johansson,"Madam President, honourable Members, I’m pleased to be with you today for this debate concerning the Directive promoting repair of goods – The Right to Repair Directive as we have come to know it. The directive is a key step towards offering consumers more sustainable choices, to continue enjoying their the products they have purchased. According to estimates, it will help consumers to save more than EUR 175 billion over the next 15 years, as it will be easier and more affordable to repair goods instead of buying new ones. To begin with, I would like to thank the rapporteur, René Repasi, and all the shadow rapporteurs and their teams for your hard work on this file. We have achieved an agreement within a very short period of time, thanks to the efficient work of everyone involved. The political agreement on the proposal is overall balanced. It preserves the objectives as well as the overall architecture of the original Commission proposal, namely encouraging consumers to repair products instead of replacing them. It sets out a number of measures that will promote repair for consumers and encourage the development of a repair business ecosystem. The new directive will introduce a new right for consumers to claim the repair of certain products beyond the legal guarantee. This new obligation to repair will apply to products that are subject to repairability requirements in EU law, such as eco-design requirements. Manufacturers will have to repair those products upon the consumer’s request, within a reasonable time and for a reasonable price. They will also need to give access to spare parts at reasonable prices, and will be prohibited to use contractual hardware or software-related barriers to repair, such as impeding the use of second-hand compatible and 3D printed spare parts by independent repairers, in line with applicable laws. If consumers want to repair products that are still covered by the legal guarantee, they will get an extra year of legal guarantee if they choose to repair the product instead of replacing it. Then, a new online European repair platform will be launched to help consumers to find repairs and give more visibility to repairers who are mostly SMEs. Finally, Member States will be obliged to take financial or non-financial measures to promote repair locally. In conclusion, the agreement is a win-win-win welcome outcome for consumers, businesses and the environment. The final agreed text encourages consumers to repair, provides clear obligations for businesses and measures to boost the development of a repair market. It is also important that the new obligations are consistent with the current and future product specific requirements, in particular those in the framework of eco design for sustainable products. So once again, I would like to thank you, Rapporteur René Repasi and your team for having worked closely with the Commission and successfully concluded the negotiations in an efficient manner and in a short time.

Miapetra Kumpula-Natri,"Dear friends and colleagues, we need regulation to tackle the increasing challenge of microplastics. They are not only harmful to the environment, but also enter into the human body. One of the biggest unintended sources of microplastics is plastic pellets used in the plastics industry. Most losses of plastic pellets ending up into the environment happen as a result of incorrect handling, for example during transport or production. That’s why it is crucial that we complete the regulation aimed at preventing pellet losses to reduce microplastic pollution as quickly as possible. In the winter of 2024, an accident in Spanish and Portuguese waters caused millions of plastic pellets to fall from a cargo ship into the sea, causing serious environmental damage. The incident shows that we need the new regulations, also covering maritime transportation. Once the pellets end up in nature, it is almost impossible to clean them. Plastic pellets are part of a wider challenge of plastic entering into nature. We need to continue to work to protect our unique and precious environment and seas.",S&D,2024-04-22,17.

Ylva Johansson,"Madam President, honourable Members, I really appreciate this debate and your strong commitment to address this very critical problem and make a real difference. Thank you. Let me also briefly reply to the issue raised by Mr Millán Mon and Ms Miranda. Maritime transport of pellets is international in nature, and would be best addressed by rules adopted globally, because the impact of such rules would be best in terms of environmental protection. This said, the recent work within the International Maritime Organization could only lead to the adoption of recommendations, which is not sufficient. As for binding measures to be adopted there, it will take several years. The Commission could therefore show openness to consider inclusion in this regulation, provided coherence with the developments of the International Maritime Organization is ensured, and the competitiveness of European industry is not jeopardised. The adoption of Parliament’s first reading is a key step that I hope will pave the way to an agreement on this important file by the end of this year. The Commission looks forward to the Council’s general approach, before the end of this semester, to start negotiations to ensure our common goal to reduce pellet losses by up to 74 %, to move closer together to zero-pollution ambition, also by adding other main sources of unintentional microplastic pollution.",-,2024-04-22,17.

Clare Daly,"Madam President, there’s no doubt about it: plastic pollution is a total scourge, and this legislation does certainly go in the right direction regarding tackling it. We’re only really beginning to learn about the toxic impacts of microplastics on the environment and, critically, on human health. But I think there’s a slight irony that we’re discussing it at the moment, on the eve of the elections in the context of Ireland, because in the next month we’re going to see 600 000 plastic posters going up the length and breadth of the country for the European and local elections. None of these are going to be made of recycled plastic. Even worse, they’re going to be exposed to the elements, these eyesores leaking millions of microplastic particles directly into the environment, the big parties with large numbers, with every candidate on every lamppost. So while the people of Ireland have constantly rejected and argued for this nonsense to be scrapped, it still goes on. I, for one, won’t be participating in it and I really think this issue must be tackled. (Pyynnöstä myönnettävät puheenvuorot päättyvät)",The Left,2024-04-22,17.

Mick Wallace,"Madam President, there’s much that’s welcome in this regulation to tackle pollution from plastic pellet losses, but in truth, we could be doing more. The regulation should include all pre-production plastic powder forms, powders, dust and flakes. It should also apply to all operators. Article 1 exempts operators handling quantities lower than five tonnes per year, and creates reduced requirements for operators handling quantities under 1000 tonnes per year. But all operators, no matter what quantity they are handling, can contribute chronic losses to the environment. Implementation of the regulations should be accelerated in terms of certification and verification. 184 000 tonnes of pellets enter the environment each year, and we shouldn’t have a four-year lead in that period either. That would also give us a realistic chance of meeting the Zero Pollution Action Plan target of a 30 % microplastic-release reduction by 2030.",The Left,2024-04-22,17.

On these forced-labour ban rules, however, we have a few of our concerns. First, the absence of an impact assessment remains a crucial point. Despite good intentions, it is essential to assess whether its costs are justified and reasonable. The partial report delivered in a few years does not suffice. Second, we have doubts on the impact on our small and medium-sized businesses. Although guidelines will be provided, the lack of a centralised national contact point may leave entrepreneurs uncertain about how to implement this regulation. Our third concern is the fact that the door for remediation remains open. While the reasons are understandable, we doubt its feasibility. Which brings me to my overall concern, and again, we believe this is sensible legislation, but our overall concern, dear Commissioner, is that we, as the European Union, are overregulating. The European Union faces grave competition. So we also need to start focusing on a competitive business climate. We hear promises from the Commission about a ‘one in, one out’ principle, better regulation, adequate impact assessments. But the reality simply does not match up.

We assassinated democratically elected leaders who spoke of independence, of breaking free of the system of exploitation that was established under the European colonialism. We use powerful lending institutions, like the World Bank and the IMF, to impose debt traps on former colonies, to keep them from developing. We force structural reforms on countries who defaulted on these impossible debt arrangements, ensuring that Western capital maintains the ability to exploit Global South resources. We have systematically de-developed former colonies in order to make lives cheap, workforces and resources cheaper and to maintain profits for Western capital at all costs. Anyone who steps out of line, who challenges the system of Western-dominated global capitalism gets sanctions, regime change and war.",The Left,2024-04-22,19.

Clare Daly,"Madam President, I think that human trafficking is, of course, a grotesque crime, and I think we all share a commitment to fighting it. But like everything else though, that apparent commitment can be abused. And we have seen that in prosecutions of migrants and NGOs for human trafficking, when actually what they’ve been doing is saving lives. And we have seen it time and again being used to browbeat people into supporting policies that harm sex workers’ rights, for example. Now, thankfully, the more extreme elements of Parliament’s position on this directive are now gone, but the push for the Nordic model is still there however watered down. This model has been criticised by everyone, from the UN to the ILO to Amnesty International and, more importantly, by sex workers themselves. Criminalisation doesn’t reduce demand, but it does succeed in harming women. Ireland introduced this model seven years ago. It was supposed to be reviewed in 2020. Four years on, that hasn’t happened because if they did, it would be exposed for the failure that it is.

Deirdre Clune,"Madam President and Commissioner, tomorrow, this Parliament will vote on the world’s first ever piece of legislation aiming to prevent spillages of plastic pellets at all stages along the supply chain. Losses of these plastic pellets, which are the base material for manufacturing plastic products, are the third largest source of unintentional microplastic releases in the EU. According to the European Chemicals Agency, almost 180 000 metric tons of plastic pellets are accidentally or unintentionally released into the environment each year. Microplastic pollution is not only a serious problem for the environment, but also for public health. Once microplastics enter our environment, it is almost impossible to get rid of them. That’s why I’m supporting this measure – and I’d urge that we all would tomorrow – because it will prevent microplastic spillages in road, rail and maritime transport. It is a practical, realistic proposal that will work, and the new law is particularly timely given the millions of plastic pellets that were washed up on the coast of Spain and Portugal, the north-western Galicia region, in January of this year. The incident has caused major disruption, threatening to endanger wildlife and posing a serious risk to the livelihoods of fishery communities and tourism communities in that area. So the proposal, which will address the release of plastic pellets into our environment, will apply to European and non-European operators. It will set requirements for best handling practices. Mandatory certification and self-declaration will be measures which will be put in place. Importantly, however, lighter requirements will apply to micro and small operators. This regulation is expected, as it is been said, to reduce the release by up to 74% of microplastics. It would result in healthier ecosystems, contributing to plastic-free rivers and oceans and, of course, reducing risks to human health. I am a strong believer that prevention is the best solution, and here we have a very practical proposal, and I want to thank the rapporteur and the other shadows for all the work that he did and that we did on this file.",PPE,2024-04-22,17.

Israel bombed an embassy in a third country, and the Brits and the US and France, they blocked condemnation of this crime at the UN Security Council.

This is the largest religious congregation in Estonia, comprising more than 100 000 believers. We all know that the Head of the Russian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate supported Russia’s war against Ukraine and called it the ‘Holy War’, which is absolutely disgusting and condemnable. And this is exactly what the Estonian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate did: it officially condemned this idea of holy war. But unfortunately, this is not enough for the Estonian authorities. They continue to insist that the words of the Moscow Patriarchate cast a shadow of terrorism on the Estonian Orthodox believers, and seem to want to legally dissolve the Estonian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate. The EU is based on the principle of protection of freedom of religion and belief, and we should not interfere in religious and ecumenical matters.

Barry Andrews,"Mr President, Commissioner and colleagues, it was my honour to launch Housing Europe’s election manifesto in Brussels in January. For the last two years, I have been exploring ways in which the EU can directly and indirectly support Ireland’s housing policy options, because the reality is that many people struggle to see what the EU can do to help them with the essentials of life, the cost of living, with healthcare and, for young Dubliners at least, access to housing. And I get it. In Ireland, despite record investment, the housing crisis remains acute, and, far from helping, some EU laws are actually stopping progress. For example, strict EU debt rules forced the government to choose between fiscal prudence and investment in public housing. That is why we need a comprehensive housing strategy for Europe to massively ramp up funding. That’s why we need a special committee on housing to work on this day in and day out.

Malin Björk,"Mr President, it has been said by several colleagues here that the majority of victims are women and girls trafficked for sexual exploitation. So, of course, that’s a big theme and a big topic if we want to be serious about combating trafficking. But I have tried to make the point also that we have to differentiate between different forms of trafficking. If we were going to be successful in the prevention as well as in the prosecution and protection part. So this is also one of the key messages. As legislators, we have tried to do that. Moreover, one of the main things is that when we try to prevent we have to address demand reduction. And we can do, you know, as much info and awareness raising towards potential victims as we want. But why should those who abuse and use and those who traffic, why should they go without having the main responsibility? That’s where the responsibility belongs. So that’s why it is so important to say no to those who exploit and those who abuse. When it comes to labour exploitation, we have to work with, of course, to detect, with trade unions, with people working, you know, going in and seeing in these places, where is the abuse going on? Where can we detect victims and provide rights when it comes to trafficking for sexual exploitation? So who should we address? Of course we should say no to pimps. What kind of Europe is that, where we legalise brothels? And when we say it’s okay to buy and sell women and girls and boys and men, it’s not! And it’s also then goes for those who actually use the buyers, it’s not so difficult. You know, we can be very liberal and Sweden is a very liberal country when it comes to sex. Whoever, whenever, what you want, but don’t pay. That is abuse. It’s harmful and it’s abuse and it feeds trafficking. So just be, you know, as other MEPs have said here, let’s be honest about that, that some people are still backwards, some people are still backwards. They think that that, you know, like that. That’s a normal thing. It’s not a normal thing. It’s the most conservative, Victorian thing that you should sell. And by women and girls, I just don’t adhere to that.

Ylva Johansson,"Mr President, dear honourable Members of this Parliament, thank you for this debate. I thank you for your commitment to fighting trafficking in human beings. As I said at the beginning, trafficking is a European crime. Many perpetrators are from the European Union, as are many victims. Over 70 % of trafficked children are from the European Union. They are trafficked and exploited inside EU borders, and 25 % are trafficked in their own Member State. Now we will have a better, more effective European approach. What we have done is raise the bar. But a Member State can put in place stricter rules or higher standards. It is important to say that the list of forms of exploitation in this directive is non-exhaustive. We made sure that Member States are criminalising at least these forms, but they can also have stricter rules. And this much-needed update of our anti-trafficking rules comes at the right time. The latest statistics show the number of detected victims is increasing. The share of labour exploitation is growing. Forced begging and forced criminality is on the rise in relative terms. But in absolute terms, so is the number of victims of sexual exploitation. What doesn’t change? Most victims are women and girls. And they are mainly trafficked for sexual exploitation. But the number of successful prosecutions is decreasing. With your vote, we will bring better protection of victims and better prosecution of perpetrators.

Cyrus Engerer,"Madam President, as a Parliament, we are strongly united to fight human trafficking and the organised criminal networks that prey on the most vulnerable people across the globe. I believe that all human trafficking should be condemned. Anyone who is forced to do anything against their own will should be considered as a victim and needs our protection in the European Union. I do agree that anyone using the services of people who have been human-trafficked should also face criminal proceedings, and that is why I agree with this very strong statement and with this very strong directive in this Parliament being discussed right now. However, if I could constructively criticise the text, I would say that we should not have listed the different reasons why people are exploited, why people are trafficked. I say this because all of it is wrong, all of it is criminal, and we can run the risk of leaving some situations out. At the same time, we have unfortunately listed all of surrogacy in general terms as something which is totally wrong – and I agree, if this is forced, it is unacceptable. But then there are some circumstances where we have altruistic surrogacy, and we need to make sure that we do not put this in a negative light. Let’s be strong.

Clare Daly,"Madam President, today, it’s estimated that at least 27 million people worldwide are captured in the horror of forced labour. Of course, the regulation before us aims to prevent the sale or export of products using forced labour within the EU market, which is obviously very good. Unlike the Due Diligence Directive, for example, this regulation is supposed to deal with all products and all companies regardless of their size, which again is good. Unfortunately, once again, the Council has watered down the possibility of what we could do here because under certain circumstances, products manufactured using forced labour but likely to lead to the disruption of a supply chain of strategic or critical importance to the Union will be allowed to circulate, which, as far as I’m concerned, is an absolute joke, because what we’re seeing is the quest for critical raw materials means ditching moral concerns in relation to the matter.

Frances Fitzgerald,"Madam President, Commissioner, Berlin, Amsterdam, Paris, Madrid, Dublin: every EU city, town and village houses a victim of human trafficking. We may not know it or just may not want to notice it, but it is clear from the figures that victims of trafficking are everywhere in our Union. I would say denial is everywhere: trafficking takes place not just in the murky underworld, but before our very eyes: 37 % of victims of trafficking in the EU are EU citizens, 15 % are children. In 2022 alone, 10 093 victims of trafficking were registered in the EU. This was a staggering 41 % increase on the previous year – of course the real number is likely to be far higher – and 63 % of those trafficked are women and girls and 60 % of those who are trafficked are trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation. Colleagues, we cannot talk about trafficking if we do not speak about prostitution: they are inextricably linked with violent criminal gangs profiteering from the exploitation of women. Let’s be clear: as the Sunday Times writer Hadley Freeman said this week, ‘let’s stop pretending that paying for sex is anything but abuse’. It is not liberating, it is not the next stage of feminism, it is abuse to exploit women for their bodies. Since when did we say that it is okay to exploit someone if they are getting paid? Never. Colleagues, it is frightening to think that young boys and girls are being trafficked across our Union.

It was the story of Ernestine, an undocumented migrant who left her home country to flee from domestic violence. Ernestine was offered a place to stay in exchange for childcare without any proper pay. In fact, her so-called employer started demanding that Ernestine contribute to bills and rent. When she reached out to help, she was recruited to work at a vegetable shop for EUR 2 per hour. Her employer would demand rent money from her because he let her sleep in the corner of the shop, that way he kept her indebted. This is not far away from home, this is in Brussels. Ernestine and many vulnerable persons are being recruited in order to be exploited and tricked into cheap labour. The update of this directive takes more measures to protect victims by introducing early detection and specialised assistance. It also provides for more opportunities to persecute perpetrators by introducing measures for legal persons, aggravating circumstances and punishment for those who knowingly use services from trafficked persons.

Ylva Johansson,"Madam President, three years ago, I spoke in this plenary about trafficking in human beings, and I spoke to you then about Susan. Susan is from Nigeria. She was tricked into coming to Europe, forced into prostitution. She escaped and testified against her traffickers. Three years ago here in the plenary, I said Susan’s story was a story of exploitation. A story of courage. But not a story of justice. Because the men who used Susan’s body faced no consequences for their actions. But now women like Susan can have justice – and that’s thanks to you, thanks to all of us. It will soon be a crime in the whole European Union to knowingly use the services of trafficked victims, not only victims of sexual exploitation, but also other forms of trafficking like labour exploitation. Previously, this was only criminalised in some Member States and now we are ending this patchwork of practices. We are making it a crime in all Member States. And this, to me, personally, was a very important goal when I put forward a proposal to update the Anti-Trafficking Directive. Trafficking is a heinous crime. Traffickers can sell drugs only once, sell weapons only once, but they can sell a woman’s body again and again and again and again. The message is now clear to anyone thinking of buying sex from a trafficked woman: there will be consequences – there will be prison. So you can be proud. You can be proud also that we will be protecting more people by clearly forbidding new forms of trafficking, zero tolerance for forced marriage, zero tolerance for illegal adoption and, at the initiative of the European Parliament, zero tolerance for trafficking for surrogate mothers. I propose the law and you improve the law. Trafficking is not only a terrible crime, it is also a European crime, a crime committed in the European Union by EU citizens against EU citizens – not only, but also – and thanks to you, we will now have a more European and more effective approach to fight this crime. When I started nearly five years ago, I was not sure we would achieve this, but thanks to your strong commitment, zero votes against in the joint LIBE-FEMM committee and unanimous agreement by the Member States, it is an amazing achievement. So I would like to thank specially the rapporteurs, Malin Björk and María Eugenia Rodríguez Palop, and of course all the shadows and their teams. And I would like also to thank the Swedish, Spanish and Belgian Presidencies for this achievement. Thank you for getting the job done so quickly and so thoroughly. Our most powerful tool against trafficking is legislation and you are the legislators. Thanks to you, we will be able to better prevent trafficking, protect victims, and prosecute perpetrators. The updated Anti-Trafficking Directive will help to identify victims earlier, assisting them in helping to bring them home with referral mechanisms in all Member States. Better coordinate our work against trafficking with mandatory national anti-trafficking coordinators in all Member States. The new directive will put the fight against trafficking on the top of the agenda. All Member States will now draft national action plans with concrete measures against traffickers and to protect victims. And we made online sexual exploitation an aggravating circumstance, which can mean higher penalties for perpetrators, because the internet is now used to commit all forms of trafficking – and also to provide statistics on this threat, to know how we could fight the enemy. Soon you will vote on the new Anti-Trafficking Directive. And when you vote, I ask you to think about Susan. I call on you to vote ‘yes’ with the same overwhelming convictions as you did in the committees, to show the crime of trafficking of human beings will not stand in Europe, and to show women like Susan: they can count on us.",-,2024-04-22,20.

It’s about protecting human rights, but it’s also about promoting our own values and standards. And this cannot be only empty talks. So yes, this is an instrument with teeth. We need to make sure that we follow up when it comes to the human rights that we sell in the world, and we are following several examples now in the world as being the EU. There are several other likeminded partners that have comparable legislation in place. Also to protect our multilateral system, and given the geopolitical situation in the world, it is very important that we harmonise as much as possible, that we try to do the same as much as possible as being likeminded partners. Because if we leverage that power, if we leverage these resources, if we leverage that knowledge, then we can be truly effective, from a multilateral perspective, when it comes to fighting for human rights and when it comes to protecting human rights.

Ska Keller,"Madam President, plastic particles have been found in the Antarctic. They have been found in the deep sea. They are harming flora and fauna, they are harming humans. And those particles, they come from tyres, from panes, from landscape fabric, from textiles, etc. from many other things. And they come from plastic pellets, flakes and powders that are supposed to be the base material for all things plastic but end up in the environment because of careless handling or because of accidents. Last December, on the coast of Galicia – an example which has been mentioned by many colleagues – more than 1 billion plastic particles were lost into the sea, but even that huge amount is not even 1 % of the yearly losses of plastic pellets. So urgent action is needed. What we are setting out to do with this legislation is exactly that urgent action. For preventing pallet losses, we don’t need some new invention, we don’t need some crazy new technologies. We need better handling. We need better measures for transport, precautionary measures, a cleaning system in place. And we also need to know who’s responsible for when things go wrong and what they have to do then, because it’s not about harassing small enterprises, it’s about making sure that some people who are making profit with the product are not harming the environment that we all depend on. This legislation is certainly not the end game in a battle against plastic pollution. But it’s a good start and one start that we have managed to improve also in the committee. I would like to thank the commission for the proposal and also the rapporteur and our shadow rapporteur. Next it’s up for the Council to be ambitious, and I hope that ministers will bring back some resolve from Canada, where they are currently discussing global plastic pollution. And if you want to lead in the world, we should start at home.",Greens/EFA,2024-04-22,17.

It will bring new life to broken appliances and make sure that we move away from a disposable economy to a circular economy. The throwaway culture has come to an end. Your smartphones, your airfryer, your bicycles can be repaired even after the expiration of a warranty or a guarantee. Saving 4 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions is the equivalent of taking 2 million cars off the road. European consumers lose almost EUR 12 billion a year in buying replacements for goods that could have been repaired.

Ylva Johansson,"Madam President, honourable Members, thank you for scheduling the Parliament’s first reading on this important proposal, which is a crucial element of EU action against microplastic pollution. Pellet losses are the third largest source of unintentional microplastic releases. This proposal will help us reduce them and achieve the 30% reduction target we set for microplastics in the Zero Pollution Action Plan. Microplastic pollution caused by pellets is a significant problem. In 2019, between 52 000 and 184 000 tonnes of pellets were lost to the environment in the European Union. Plastic pellet losses at all stages of the supply chain cause negative impacts on the environment and, potentially, on human health. They are a persistent source of pollution of our rivers, seas and the ocean. Once in the environment, plastic pellets are difficult and costly to clean up. Accidental losses, like those off the coast of Spain and Portugal earlier this year, are occasional, but can create sudden and significant negative impacts on affected communities, livelihoods and ecosystems. Reducing microplastic pollution directly benefits the fishing and aquaculture sectors, as well as other sectors, like tourism. It is an excellent example where protecting the environment goes hand in hand with supporting local economic activities. Therefore, with our proposal, we aim to prevent and reduce pellet losses by up to 74%. This will take us closer to our ‘Zero Pollution’ ambition, with a minimal burden on SMEs. The Commission welcomes warmly the support of the European Parliament for the proposal and many of the proposed improvements of its core elements. These improvements concern in particular the definitions, the key handling requirements for all actors and stages of the pellet supply chain, and the compliance check system. They also concern the annual 1 000 tonne threshold for third-party certification, and the lighter requirements for microenterprises, as well as the assistance to stakeholders to comply with the requirements and the standardised methodology to estimate pellet losses. However, the text being discussed today also contains a number of changes on which the Commission needs, at this stage, to reserve its position. These include new obligations for economic operators such as labelling all storage and transport containers, shorter deadlines for notifying renewals of risk assessment plans and self-declarations, and making all the measures listed in Annex I mandatory. We are concerned about the new obligations for small enterprises, notably about mandating third-party certification, annual internal assessment and awareness and training programme, and also about new obligations for non-EU carriers. We need to look carefully at the new obligations for the competent national authorities and for the Commission. Overall, our priority is to strike the right balance between ambition and feasibility. For that, we must continue to aim for a simple and coherent framework for the responsible handling of pellets. We need, for sure, a radical change, away from the laxness of the current approach and the poor handling at all stages. At the same time, we should avoid an excessive burden on our economic operators. Regarding the broadening of the regulation’s scope to include maritime transports of pellets, as maritime transport is international in nature. The Commission is determined to continue to work on global rules in the International Maritime Organisation to ensure harmonisation of international, national and regional rules. In particular, it is important that mandatory rules are agreed on three aspects: transport information, quality packaging and safe storage. At the same time, the Commission is open to consider inclusion of maritime transport of pellets in the regulation, provided that coherence with the developments at the International Maritime Organisation is ensured, and that the competitiveness of the European industry is not jeopardised. I look forward to listening to your views and your suggestions.",-,2024-04-22,17.

In commemorating this terrible event, we also wish to reiterate our unwavering commitment to the prevention of genocide and any crime against humanity across the world. To ensure full accountability, we must continue to ensure that the drivers of genocide such as xenophobia, discrimination and hate speech targeting national, ethnic, racial or religious groups are condemned and fought against. The international community must remain united in this goal. In Rwanda, people commemorate these events under the name Kwibuka, which means ‘to remember’. We do the same today.

President,"Dear colleagues, can I ask you to take your seats and then we can start this last plenary before the elections. My first announcement is about Swedish nationals in Iran. Last week, we marked two years since Swedish national and EU official Johan Floderus was illegally detained in Iran. This week Professor Ahmadreza Djalali, also a Swedish national, will have been jailed for eight years – making him the EU national held longest in Iran. On these sad anniversaries, the European Parliament once again condemns their arrest by the Iranian regime, in the strongest possible terms. Last week, I joined Commissioner Johansson at a vigil we held with Johan Floderus’ loved ones, as I reiterated this Parliament’s support. We will continue to work tirelessly to secure the release of our friends Johan, Ahmadreza and all others held on trumped-up charges. Also, dear colleagues, as this is the last plenary session before the European Parliament elections in June, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you all for your tireless work over the past five years. It has been challenging, but this Parliament has delivered. Over the last years, we have navigated our way out of COVID restrictions. We have led the European debate that has made people’s lives a little bit easier, a little bit safer and little bit more secure. We have passed ground-breaking legislation on artificial intelligence, on migration, on asylum, on climate, on creating jobs and safeguarding European industry and agriculture, on new tech, and on digital services and digital markets. We have passed huge files on equality – there are still some left this week – and reinforced the social pillar. We have doubled down on making this Union a superpower of rights everywhere. We have faced the invasion of Ukraine, de-coupled from Russia and created new energy and health priorities. We have stood up for humanity in the Middle East and around the world. We have given new life into our mandate to promote parliamentary diplomacy and freedom. We have listened, we have learned, and we have burst through the Brussels and Strasbourg bubbles to engage with, and reach out to, people across Member States. We have worked hard to ensure that this House is more efficient, more effective and fit for purpose. We have made it more open and more independent. We have negotiated and balanced budgets. We have ensured that this is a place of work that people feel proud of and feel safe at. We have done all of this together. We have debated, we have acted and we have delivered for people. And for that I want to thank all of you, all your staff and all of Parliament’s services. I am so proud to be here, I am so proud of the work we have done, and I hope you feel I have repaid your trust and faith in me. I also want to pay tribute to the legacy of my predecessor, David Sassoli. He gave so much for this Parliament and for Europe, and I hope he would be proud of us, too. (Applause) Now, colleagues, our work does not end here. In just over six weeks’ time, EU citizens in all Member States will be called upon to elect the 720 Members of the European Parliament that will make up the 10th legislative term. Now is the moment to speak up for Europe: to call upon people – especially young people – to vote, to invite them to shape the future they want to see.

Maria Spyraki,"Madam President, dear Commissioner, dear colleagues, when it comes to microplastic leakage, prevention is the only solution. Tackling the unintentional release of plastic pellets addresses a serious problem, not only for our environment, but also for our health. This proposal for a regulation aims to ensure that all operators handling pellets in the EU take the necessary precautionary measures. As the rapporteur on behalf of the ITRE Committee, it is important to highlight that we agree on, first, the non-binding recommendation adopted by the parties to the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic, which will be taken into account. Second, the period of six months after entering into force to develop awareness-raising and training on the implementation of the regulation. It is also important to highlight that funds will be available to develop training material. Assistance for SMEs (small and medium enterprises) could take the form of specialised management and staff training, organisational and technical assistance. This provision can also be in the form of financial support and access to finance, including the acquisition of equipment required to achieve compliance. Tomorrow we will vote in favour of a key step towards our commitment to reduce microplastics pollution by 30 % by 2030. It is important to have consistency in our policies.

There is zero evidence about the Israeli claims. UNRWA is the central agency providing a lifeline of support in Gaza. Israel’s completely unsubstantiated claims about connections with Hamas were a disgusting attempt to both distract from and further compound their genocidal assault on the men, women and children of Gaza. The refugees of Gaza are reduced to eating animal feed and grasses. Death by starvation is on the rise. Water is contaminated. Thousands of children are suffering and wasting.

President,"Dear colleagues, we will have a quick round of speakers relating to International Roma Day, which is celebrated today. International Roma Day is a day to celebrate Romani culture, history and language and pay tribute to Europe’s largest ethnic minority. Romani people can be proud Europeans – proud of their contribution to the rich mosaic of our European societies. They form an integral part of our communities. But even if so, the reality is that too many Romani women and men in Europe still live in the margins of society. It is unacceptable that discrimination and racism continue to plague our communities. For far too long, Romani people have suffered under unfounded bias and prejudice. Restricted access to education, difficulties in entering the labour market and insufficient healthcare represent just a few of the injustices Roma people face. In our Europe, we cherish our differences, our unique traditions, our cultures and our diversity. We know that this is where our true strength lies. That means that Roma people living within our Union’s borders must enjoy the same rights, the same treatment, but also the same opportunities, the same chances as any other European citizen. Romani children should have every reason to expect the promise of Europe to deliver for them too. In the European Parliament we will continue playing our part in driving positive change.

It is essential that we wake up and take a strong and unified stance in the face of Fico’s autocratic grip: the special anti-corruption office, the public broadcaster, criminal law amendments – everything is in the firing line. We do not have time to lose in Slovakia. With the election of President Pellegrini, the system will seize full grip over the independent institutions. A freezing of funds, an Article 7 procedure, clear messaging – that is what we need. Dear citizens of Slovakia, the European Parliament stands with you. By standing together in defence of democracy we must send a powerful message both to Slovakia and to all our European citizens: democracy matters and we will do everything to protect it.

Siegfried Mureşan,"Madam President, dear colleagues, the European Union is a Union based on rules and it is based on values, and these rules are meant to serve the people in every corner of the European Union. The common rules and the common values that the Union is based on are the freedom of speech, the freedom of expression, the freedom of people to say what they feel, what they want, to support whom they want, to criticise whom they want; the rule of law, fighting against corruption, building strong, independent, resilient institutions, and a strong and independent judiciary serving the citizens. We are seeing that these values are in danger today in Slovakia. And the rules in Europe are also clear: whoever wants to receive European support has to respect European values. We, as the European Union, would like to support the people of Slovakia as they strive for a better life – as the European Union is supporting citizens everywhere in Europe. With NextGenerationEU, we have created the biggest package of economic recovery ever, and we want the people of Slovakia to continue benefiting from this. But let me say very clearly: whoever wants to receive European financial support needs to respect European values. With his current actions, Mr Fico and his government are endangering the financial support from the European Union. If they continue to attack the rule of law, if they continue to attack European rules and European values – which are good for the people of Slovakia – they put at risk the European support for the people of Slovakia. We do not want this to happen. We hope Mr Fico stops being an obstacle to the people of Slovakia’s will to receive European support.",PPE,2024-04-11,3.

Didier Reynders,"Madame la Présidente, Monsieur le Secrétaire d’État, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, comme je l’ai souligné à plusieurs reprises, notamment dans cet hémicycle, encore hier, nous devons plus que jamais protéger la démocratie, l’état de droit et les droits fondamentaux dans l’ensemble de l’Union européenne. La Commission a intensifié ses efforts et, vous le savez, le rapport annuel sur l’état de droit joue un rôle central à cet égard. En décembre de l’année dernière, j’ai eu l’opportunité de vous présenter les conclusions et les recommandations concernant la Slovaquie dans le rapport de 2023. À l’heure actuelle, la Commission est en train de préparer la cinquième édition du rapport, qui sera publiée en juillet. Aujourd’hui, je souhaiterais aborder quelques développements récents en Slovaquie en ce qui concerne l’état de droit et la liberté des médias. Since October, there have been several developments in Slovakia which raise serious concerns and on which we have been in close contact with the Slovak authorities. We have noted the amendments to the criminal code and other related acts. During our last plenary debate, I already expressed the Commission’s views on these amendments, notably from the perspective of EU law requirements related to the protection of the financial interests of the Union by means of criminal law. As you are aware, these legislative changes were adopted under a fast-track procedure at the beginning of February, despite the Commission’s request to give more time for proper consultations both at national and at European level. The amendments risk undermining the fight against corruption and the protection of the European Union’s financial interests, in particular as regards the lowering of penalties amongst others. The Commission notes that the reform, as adopted, did address some of the issues that the Commission had identified regarding an earlier draft as being not in compliance with EU law. The Commission also notes that the government decided on the 21 February to withdraw from the fast-track procedure its plan to amend the whistleblower protection law in a way that raises serious concerns as to its compliance with the EU directive, and intends to present a revised version under the standard legislative procedure. On the other hand, the Commission had to take note that Slovakia decided to dissolute the special prosecutor’s office, despite the Commission’s request not to use again the fast-track procedure for that dissolution and to have sufficient guarantees to safeguard a proper handover before the dissolution. The Commission remains in contact with the Slovak authorities to further discuss the actual impact of this change. What arrangements have been made for the handling of cases, and whether the new setup ensures an effective continuation of the ongoing investigations and cases, notably concerning those cases which affect the financial interests of the Union. The Commission is assessing these changes also from the perspective of the requirements of the Recovery and Residence Facility and, notably, the continued effectiveness of Slovakia’s control and audit system. We equally take note of the decision of the Slovak Constitutional Court of 28 February to temporarily suspend several provisions of the new criminal law, but not the dissolution of the special prosecutor’s office. We will keep monitoring the developments in that case. We hope to be able to find solutions that will ensure compliance with EU law and the commitments taken by Slovakia under the Recovery and Resilience Plan. However, we will not hesitate to take action to ensure respect of EU law and the protection of the EU’s financial interests as necessary, and if all the conditions of the relevant instruments are fulfilled. The 2024 report will follow up on the findings of last year’s report, also in relation to media freedom and pluralism. As regards the autonomy of public service media, the 2023 report concluded that in the previous reporting period some progress was made on strengthening the independence of public service media. However, already then, the Commission noted stakeholders’ concerns over the financial situation of the public service broadcasters as well as the abolition of the household licence fee. Since then, the Commission has taken note of the plans of the new government to introduce legislative changes regarding the public service broadcaster. The Commission understands that consultations are ongoing at national level on these plans. The Commission will monitor closely the developments to ensure that proposed changes are in compliance with EU law. The Commission recalls that the Media Freedom Act, as recently been adopted by the European Parliament and the Council, and it is important that any changes to national legislations are in line with that act. As regards the safety of journalists, the 2023 report considered that some progress was made during the previous reporting period. However, the Commission notes that since then there has been no further legislative progress on the bill aimed to improve the physical safety and working environment of journalists. A 2023 survey conducted by the Investigative Center of Jan Kuciak found that two thirds of Slovak journalists experienced threats or intimidation in the preceding 12 months, while four persons experienced a physical attack. The Commission takes note of concerns voiced by stakeholders that disparagement of journalists and media outlets by government exponents have been on the rise. The Commission calls on all Member States, including Slovakia, to implement the Commission recommendation on the safety of journalists. To address the phenomenon of SLAPPs, the Commission presented in 2022 an ambitious package. The Commission will monitor the implementation of the Anti-SLAPP Directive, recently adopted by the co-legislators, as well as of the Commission’s recommendation of 2022. I am now turning to the institutional checks and balances and the civil society framework. As I mentioned before, the recent developments raise particular concerns over the lack of proper consultations of the public and of relevant stakeholders, as well as the use of fast-tracked legislative procedures on complex proposals. Moreover, the Commission has taken note of the recent new draft reform tabled by four MEPs before the Slovak Parliament at the end of March, introducing obligatory labelling of certain so-called organisations with foreign support. The Commission will follow the ongoing national discussions on this new reform very closely. In this context, let me add that the Commission is also concerned about recent amendments with regard to the Slovak Statistical Office, which contain revised grounds for the appointment and dismissal of the head of office. The Commission is currently assessing whether these legislative amendments comply with the professional independence requirements of EU law on European statistics. You know that there were also some remarks from the Chief Prosecutor of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office about the current situation in Slovakia and, of course, we will continue to analyse together the situation. And I am very pleased now to listen to your remarks and observations before concluding this debate today, but not concluding the assessment of the Commission about the situation in Slovakia.",-,2024-04-11,3.

Didier Reynders,"Mr President, let me congratulate again Parliament for the broad provisional agreement that has been reached on the legislative files, and the discussions here today, and again thank the rapporteurs and shadows for the very good cooperation. It was instrumental to deliver these legislative amendments in a short time frame with such a high quality. The Commission will work together with the Member States and stakeholders to support a swift and correct implementation of these crucial measures. We are already preparing follow-up actions resulting from the Electricity Market Design reform and the hydrogen and decarbonised gas market package, including new delegated and implementing acts to outline necessary detailed technical rules, and several guidance documents to facilitate smooth implementation. I now look forward to a successful adoption of the legislative acts for both files in this Hemicycle, which is crucial for the EU’s future-proof energy market that delivers to European households and businesses. I thank you for the debate today and for your remarks and comments. And, of course, now – again – we are going to the final steps in Parliament and the Council, but then we will start the work with the Member States to have a correct implementation of all those new legislative files.",-,2024-04-11,"2.

Ignazio Corrao,"Mr President, colleagues, first of all I would like to thank all those who have been working on this gas package for more than two years. I especially thank the rapporteur on the directive, Mr Geier, who with patience and passion managed to find a not-easy compromise. The gas package, in its complexity, is above all our response to the energy crisis caused by the vile attack of Russia on Ukraine and Europe. In this directive, there are positive elements that protect European citizens from the threat of dependence on Russian gas and add countless guarantees against energy poverty and the most vulnerable citizens. However, the core of the Gas Directive concerns the definition of rules for the future hydrogen market, and here the result, from my point of view, is disappointing. We have made many improvements on the general principles of the hydrogen market, on governance and on planning, but we have not been able to introduce rules to prevent conflicts of interest between gas companies and hydrogen companies. Therefore, the risk that hydrogen is just a greenwashing operation for fossil gas is still present. For these reasons we decided to abstain.",Greens/EFA,2024-04-11,"2.

Claudia Gamon,"Mr President, this law is a major step towards decarbonising the gas supply and moving away from gas altogether wherever possible. It will be a key instrument for us to free ourselves from Russian ‘blood gas’. Decarbonisation starts locally and this law supports this transition bottom-up by allowing for local planning. This will be a major step in recognising that decarbonisation strategies will differ from town to town, from village to village, and they have to work locally. I’m also really happy that we allow to decommission infrastructure where it is no longer needed, to make clear that the future will look entirely different. We also make it clear that where there is no alternative, where we need renewable hydrogen, industries should get priority instead of wasting it elsewhere where there are better alternatives.

Cristian-Silviu Buşoi,"Mr President, dear Commissioner, dear colleagues, we are here today after long months and years of hard work and perseverance, and for the agreements reached, I would like to congratulate my colleagues, the rapporteurs: President Buzek, Mr Geier and Mr González Casares. Following the rise in energy prices in the light of the post-COVID recovery, in the midst of Green Deal transformation and Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine, the European Union has found itself struggling with extremely high energy prices and energy supply issues. With these packages of legislation – the EMD, gas and hydrogen – we have shown that we can react to the needs of our citizens and to the rapid changes in the market and our economies. We have shown that we can deliver to our people. The new directive aims to decarbonise the EU’s energy sector by ramping up the production of renewable gases and hydrogen, and facilitating their integration into EU energy networks. It will also help secure energy supply in order to address both climate change and disruption of gas flows. It puts in place for Member States ways to prevent disconnections, and clear and fair pricing for renewables. With the regulation, we will enable the uptake of renewable and low-carbon gases by facilitating connection and access to the existing gas grid, and this will reinforce energy security. Parliament has fought for the potential that we saw in gas and hydrogen for the transitional period and for a clean economy. Therefore, this regulation secures also the benefit of integrating the three European networks for hydrogen, electricity and gas.",PPE,2024-04-11,"2.

Didier Reynders,"Mr President, honourable Members, I’m pleased to be here today for this very important occasion to endorse the electricity market design reform and the hydrogen and decarbonised gas markets package. I’m replacing, as you know, my colleague Kadri Simson, who unfortunately could not be here today. These legislative initiatives are key for the decarbonisation of our energy system, for improving European energy security and for boosting the competitiveness of the EU economy. This is achieved by bringing stability and predictability to the cost of energy and to investments. The EU integrated and interconnected energy market is our biggest asset and its proper functioning is crucial. That is exactly what these legislative initiatives are about. Well-functioning energy markets are key to delivering the EU Green Deal and REPowerEU plan objectives. The value that the markets create contributes directly to EU competitiveness. I convey my warmest thanks to the rapporteurs, Mr Buzek and Mr González Casares, and to the team of shadow rapporteurs, for all your efforts and remarkable work in bringing these important files to a successful and ambitious conclusion. Parliament played a key role in delivering this file. First and foremost, these legislative initiatives will accelerate the deployment and integration of renewable energy sources and create a more effective enabling framework. The electricity market design reform will promote power purchase agreements and contracts for differences. These instruments will ensure that the low and predictable costs of renewables are better reflected in consumer bills, and thereby contribute to the affordability of prices. At the same time, these instruments will enhance revenue certainty for investors and thereby incentivise investments in renewables and low-carbon solutions that are needed to boost the energy transition. The hydrogen and gas package will enhance production and better integration in the gas network of renewable and low-carbon gases, including hydrogen and biomethane. The new framework also creates legal certainty for much-needed investments into the decarbonisation of the gas sector. For hydrogen, the new regulatory framework is based on proven principles of energy regulation, which already apply to natural gas and electricity, notably third party access and unbundling of energy networks. The reinforced requirements for mandatory ten-year network planning at national level will improve the efficiency of network development and frame the development of the distribution network. The balanced compromise reached by the co-legislators on the European Organisation of Hydrogen Network Operators will benefit this network planning and the setting of network rules. These legislative acts will also make our energy system more resilient and competitive. With the electricity market design reform, the energy bills of European consumers and companies will be more independent from the short-term market price of electricity that is still often determined by power production using expensive, fossil technologies. The gas package will strengthen the solidarity mechanism between the Member States to ensure security of supply, even in the most challenging circumstances. It will also give the Member States an opportunity to restrict access to Russian gas, in line with the REPowerEU objectives. The gas package also foresees the establishment of a permanent and voluntary mechanism for demand aggregation and the joint purchasing of natural gas. Building on the experience of AggregateEU, this mechanism will contribute to the further diversification away from Russian fossil fuels and displays a high level of cooperation among Member States, in line with the objectives defined again in REPowerEU. In addition, the Gas and Hydrogen Regulation provides for a five-year pilot mechanism for hydrogen market development, which will help connect Europe hydrogen offtakers to producers within the EU and globally. Finally, but equally as important, consumers are now better protected and empowered. Consumers will gain long-awaited rights and protections in the gas market, bringing them up to date with their rights as electricity consumers. Thanks to the electricity market design reform, energy sharing and diverse new electricity offers will become a reality, helping consumers to better control their energy bills. I am looking forward to the plenary vote for these legislative files. Swift transposition and implementation of the new rules will be key to ensure that European citizens and companies can reap the benefits of a well-functioning internal energy market. The Commission will be a strong ally to Member States, stakeholders, people and businesses, by fostering best practices for a smoother and more sustainable energy market for all.",-,2024-04-11,"2.

We need to empower our people to defend themselves and to make conscious political decisions not to vote for Kremlin hybrid agents.

If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck. We can introduce very simple criteria for a Kremlin duck test to recognise that somebody probably is not a duck, but a Kremlin hybrid agent. If a politician or political party suggests not to give Ukraine weapons and says that it will help to achieve peace, if the party introduces foreign agent laws, if the government declares the LGBT community an extremist organisation, if the government puts political opponents into prison, if the party gets financial support from the Kremlin or is financed by local oligarchs with business ties to Kremlin, those politicians, political parties or governments most probably are Kremlin agents.

Věra Jourová,"Mr President, honourable members, thank you very much for this debate. I am very encouraged that we agree on the need to protect our democracy and our values from malign outside forces, especially two months ahead of elections to the European Parliament. So many times I heard in this room today that we need to accelerate our support for the electoral campaigns and for the democratic process leading to the elections, which are upcoming already in two months. I am travelling to many Member States now, and I was in Latvia this week and I am tomorrow going to Portugal, then to Greece – I will not name all the States. I come to the countries with a question: how can we support you in protecting the electoral processes and free and fair elections, especially against the risk or in danger of cyber-security threats, foreign interference, disinformation, be it produced outside or domestically. I can tell you that I see a lot of attention at the level of the Member States. I speak to the authorities organising the elections. I speak to the media organisations, to the enforcers of the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act. I speak to a number of people who do the fact checking in the Member States, because we need more of that. We also need the platforms to pay for the fact checking, because it’s in their interest to have the information space which they created free of crime and disinformation, which can do really serious harm to the electoral process. So, we do everything not to underestimate none of those threats. Of course, we will see how the elections will look like. I am not travelling to the Member States to advise who to vote, but again, how to protect the system. I’d like to come back some time in September with the assessment of how the electoral campaigns looked like, because we are making, if not a mistake, then maybe some little underestimation, that we are always looking forward and not so much back to analyse how the campaign looked like and whether we could have done more to protect the purity of the electoral process. I am grateful for the activity done by the European political parties. It was based on my initiative, but they signed yesterday the Code of Conduct with the promise that they will refrain from using disinformation and deepfakes and other manipulative techniques in the electoral campaigns. I heard from the European political parties that they will also address the national political parties to do the same thing in order to see as much as possible a clean campaign which will enable the voters to cast their well-informed autonomous vote. I also appreciate the efforts of the digital industry, because they signed a similar code of conduct with the promise that they will label the AI production deepfakes, or they will remove them, in the case of the deepfakes which might really in a very intense way and dangerous way manipulate the free vote.

Eva Maydell,"Russian interference operations in our elections show that the country’s authoritarianism will not stop in Ukraine. Instead, one of Putin’s nefarious long-term aims is counteracting democracy on the entire European continent. Naturally, this should not come as a surprise. Supporting Trump in 2016 and 2020, spreading lies in Ukrainian media long before the full-scale invasion began, and targeting tens of elections globally are certified instances of Russian election interference. Russia’s recent attempt at sowing discontent, damaging public confidence in democratic institutions, and undermining popular support for Ukraine by buying the voices of certain Members of this house is understandable given our steadfast support of Ukraine. Putin understood that he could not win on the battlefield, so he decided to attack Ukraine’s supporters. Suffering such a cowardly attack should be a sign that we are on the right side of history. We can remain so by keeping two goals in mind. First, we must counteract Russia’s lie-based narratives in all public fora in televised debates, in the written media, and on online platforms – in all European languages. Second, we must continue supporting Ukraine: military, economic, and humanitarian aid and ammunition are crucial in this fight.",PPE,2024-04-10,"23.

Margaritis Schinas,"Mr President, Minister, honourable Members, our relationship with China has always been a broad and complex relationship, based on a shared interest in peace and security, as well as the effective functioning of the rules-based multinational order, but also on a trade relationship that needs to be balanced and reciprocal. This bilateral relationship, of major importance in the current economic and geopolitical context, requires open and frank exchanges, including on a growing number of irritants that, as partners, we need to address – on human rights violations, trade imbalance, foreign interference. On the latter, the Commission has repeatedly condemned any form of foreign interference on the sovereign territory of our Member States. This is why the EU has been following with concern reports about Chinese overseas police stations in a number of Member States, which allegedly carry out tasks involving extraterritorial action by branches of the Chinese state in the territory of our Member States. The Commission had already expressed our strong concerns regarding such alleged practices in the fifth progress report on the implementation of the security union strategy back in December 2022. As the Vice-President in charge of our security union, I find these practices simply unacceptable. If true, such unlawful actions would constitute serious violations of human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law, on which our Union is founded. EU Member States are the ones who are responsible for maintaining the law and order, and safeguarding internal security on their own soil. They are also responsible for investigating any alleged violation of the laws or transgression of their competences in internal security, whenever these occur on their territory. And they should do so with determination and commitment. Our EU agencies, law enforcement agencies such as Europol and Eurojust, stand ready to support our Member States in their investigations. Beyond this, the EU must continue to step up our efforts against foreign interference. You just had a debate with my colleague, Věra Jourová, before this one. The EU has repeatedly made the case for the need to address information manipulation campaigns, including disinformation and foreign interference from a range of actors, including from China and other emerging actors, in a more systematic way. Work is ongoing to step up the work in this area, such as through the foreign information manipulation and interference toolbox. Honourable Members, defending our societies against these threats means safeguarding the common public space in which ideas can be freely debated, formed, exchanged. This battle is a battle and a matter of European security, but it is also a battle about our democracy, about our model of society, our European way of life. And with the tools we are developing, and together with our Member States, we think that this is a battle that can be won.",-,2024-04-10,24.

Věra Jourová,"Mr President, honourable Members, two months ago, you expressed in this assembly your outrage and grave concern about the repeated efforts by Russia to undermine European democracy. It is obviously disturbing that Parliament has had to return so quickly to the same issue. I find the recent revelations by the Czech secret service, in cooperation with other Member State services, about the Russian influence network and the operations of the Voice of Europe website very troubling, but they only confirm what I have been saying for a long time. Our democracy cannot be taken for granted and the Kremlin will continue using disinformation, malign interference, corruption and any other dirty tricks from the authoritarian playbook to divide Europe. We have to remain vigilant, both against corruption and against unjustified foreign involvement. This Commission has done an unprecedented amount of work to strengthen Europe’s democratic resilience. I fully agree with what you wrote in your February resolution. We need a crosscutting approach or what we called in the European democracy action plan a ‘whole of society’ approach. And let us be aware of the fact that there is no silver bullet. There is not one solution. We need to be alert and work both on the European and national level. We need to involve not only authorities, but also civil society, media and citizens. In the last month, I have been touring Europe with exactly this goal in mind, to raise awareness across the board to share and learn best practices. I have no doubt Russia will continue to be active in our information and decision-making space, so we have to constantly learn and adapt. This is why in December last year, we presented the defence of democracy package to shed more light against hidden foreign interference. As the key element in this package, we proposed a directive laying down common transparency and accountability standards for interest representation activities on behalf of third countries. Thanks to this proposal, citizens will know who is behind different interest representations when they are used by third countries to influence political debates and decision-making processes in the Union. Specifically on elections, the Commission issued a recommendation on inclusive and resilient elections in December last year. It touches upon the funding of national political parties and political candidates from third countries. Member States are encouraged to identify and address gaps in their legislation and other regulatory measures related to such funding, in particular by promoting transparency and by limiting or prohibiting donations from third countries. The recommendation also included a call on political parties in relation to their conduct during the election campaign. I am happy to say that, with the facilitation of the Commission, all the European parties signed on 9 April such a common code of conduct ahead of the 2024 elections to the European Parliament. In addition, on the same day, the regulation on the transparency of political advertising entered into force. With this law, we give citizens the possibility to see who is behind political advertisements and how much money has been paid for such campaigns. The Commission, together with Parliament and the Council, is also part to the interinstitutional agreement on a mandatory transparency register, which entered into force in July 2021. We believe that the EU institutions must meet the highest transparency and integrity standards. This is why, last June, the Commission adopted a proposal for the creation of an interinstitutional ethics body. The Commission welcomes the agreement of all institutions and advisory bodies of the EU on this proposal, while regretting the fact that the European Council decided not to participate. The agreement is a significant contribution to a common culture of ethics regarding the members of the institutions and advisory committees at EU level. The plenary vote in two weeks will be very important. I look forward to the signature and entry into force ahead of the European elections of 2024. The influence operations conducted by Russia within Parliament also include allegations of potential corruption. The Commission has made the fight against corruption a priority. In May of last year, we presented legislation to strengthen the fight against corruption in Member States. This would ensure that all kinds of corruption are criminalised, including trading in influence and abuse of power. I would urge swift agreement on this text and to maintain a high level of ambition. The Commission has in parallel continued to impose sanctions against Russia, and we have redoubled our efforts with international partners to counter sanctions circumvention. We also established a framework for protection against foreign interference and disinformation in the digital sphere. The Digital Services Act is a global first legal standard for tackling disinformation, and also protecting of freedom of expression and information. This is also complemented by the revised Code of Practice on Disinformation, whose signatories agreed on strategies and measures to fight disinformation. We have also recently issued Digital Services Act guidelines for elections for providers of very large online platforms and search engines. The External Action Service also coordinated work on the EU toolbox to tackle foreign information manipulation and interference, covering the entire spectrum from situational awareness to resilience building, regulation and diplomatic responses. Dear president, honourable Members, we have done a lot to protect our democracy from malign interference, but there is still a lot to be done, and I trust that this House will also look at what lessons can be drawn from the recent revelations, and what more can be done. The Member States also have a key role to play in following up on the recent revelations, as well as in terms of prevention. There are aspects that cannot be dealt with by regulation and, in that context, it is very encouraging to see cooperation of intelligence services. I am looking forward to the debate on this issue.",-,2024-04-10,"23.

If those allegations are confirmed, this would constitute a betrayal of the voters and an attack on the very substance of our democracies.

As we face the revelations of influence and interference, let us be clear: there is no place in this Parliament, and no place in Europe, for those who would destabilise our Union, undermine our democracies, or erode our freedoms for personal gain or foreign agendas. To protect Europe, we must take a firm stance against this form of corruption and betrayal that will damage the reputation of our Parliament.

I’m not joking; the debate is important because what has happened in Russia is important. These elections did not bring any change in Russia. And so there is no change in our policy towards Russia. These elections took place in an ever-shrinking political space. Russian voters were deprived of a real choice. Many candidates were precluded from running, including all those who oppose the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine. I am happy to see that all the Members that took the floor in this debate support the important work that we are doing in order to support the Russian civil society organisations, the human rights defenders and independent media. Regarding the rights of minorities in the electoral process, according to the Russian Constitution, Russian citizens, including minorities, can run to vote. We have been topping up the funding for Russia pro-democracy, anti-war actors in size and, in a number of operations we will continue supporting the Russian human rights defenders and their agenda in international human forums. We monitor judicial cases in Russia together with Member States. Supporting independent media is crucial, as has been demonstrated in the electoral context. All Russia should have access to reliable information. We will continue calling on Russia to abolish its repressive legislation concerning what they claim to be foreign agents. Any one of you would be considered undesirable or, more recently, wanted, and to be called undesirable or wanted in Russia opens the door to arbitrary detentions. I think I have to finish my speech because maybe you have more important things to do in the coming moments. I know you are going to face important decisions, but I want to reiterate that Russia must cease its illegal war of aggression against Ukraine, withdraw its military forces, as demanded also the United Nations General Assembly by an overwhelming majority of 141 Member States.

It’s a mockery of choice that we’ve been experiencing for the past months and witnessing for the past months in Russia. An election campaign made by the Kremlin – made that political opponents were killed. Also, some of us who are friends with them, or some of us who gave them prizes, have witnessed that. The political campaign made in the Kremlin meant that some few authentic opposition candidates were disqualified for no reasons, and it meant that people in occupied territories in Ukraine were not just killed and tortured – they were at gunpoint subjugated under a new occupier tsar. We already witness the fallout of this travesty of elections: Ukraine terrorised even more and Russians controlled even tighter. Under those circumstances, our answer can be only threefold. The EU should state clearly that these elections were an illegitimate farce. We must urgently increase help for Ukraine so that they don’t have to vote once again under gunpoint.

On the eve of this special operation, which Putin calls elections, Aleksei Navalny died in a Gulag-like prison in the Arctic. A man whom Putin feared and therefore tortured.

Josep Borrell Fontelles,"Madam President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, as you know very well, the Russian presidential elections held on 15-17 March did not meet democratic standards and were illegally held in the occupied territories of Ukraine – temporarily occupied. These elections were based on repressive laws, persecution of political opposition leaders, civil society representatives and journalists, including those opposing Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine. These elections were marked with arbitrary detention and the terror caused by the poisoning and death of key figures like Alexei Navalny. They took place under a flood of disinformation, lack of access to independent media and strong propaganda supported by massive public funds for many years. So to call that elections is an irony. For the first time, Russian authorities decided not to invite observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. This is not only contrary to Russia’s own international commitment, but has also denied Russia’s voters and institutions the transparency and independent assessment of these elections. In an autocracy like Russia, where freedom of information and checks and balances just don’t exist, official electoral figures need to be assessed against the full electoral context, and the fact is that all the above abusive measures guaranteed Putin an electoral process free from genuine political competence and deprived Russian citizens of their right to stand in the elections and make a free and informed political choice with their vote. That’s why, on behalf of the European Union, I want to reiterate here that I strongly condemn, as we have done many times, the illegitimate elections that Russia has organised in the temporarily occupied Ukrainian territories, and as the European Union High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy I have never shied away from bringing our message to Putin’s regime, to uphold the rights of all Russian political leaders and activists, civil society representatives, human rights defenders and independent media, to firmly condemn the attempted illegal annexation of Ukrainian territories and now Russia’s full scale war of aggression against Ukraine. The European Union has demonstrated, and will keep demonstrating, that any continued internal repression and external aggression by Putin’s regime does have negative consequences. Russia’s regime underestimated the resilience and unity of Europeans. We have demonstrated that our unity is unbreakable and that despite Russia’s attempt to interfere in our democracies – as I am sure they will try to do again in the next European elections – and no matter how much they invest in disinformation and manipulation of information, and even trying to pay or maybe paying a few European Union politicians to spread Russia’s propaganda. This is despicable, not only illegal, and I welcome that our strong democratic institutions are already taking measures to investigate and condemn these acts. I want to praise the strong political stand of this Parliament, which has never hesitated to support the unprecedented measures that the European Union has taken to respond to both the internal and international aggression by the Russian regime. As Members of this Parliament know very well, we have imposed by unanimity of all Member States 13 sanctions to respond to Russia’s aggression and invasion of Ukraine, and following Navalny’s death, we imposed sanctions against 33 persons and two entities under the human rights sanctions regime – by the way, a regime that I proposed to create in my first Foreign Affairs Council as High Representative, and which now we have in order to fight against human rights violators. Now we have a new Russia-specific sanctions regime, which is under discussion by Member States, and I hope it will be approved swiftly as well. Russia’s economy and their war machinery has been considerably weakened by our sanctions, and in time the effect of these sanctions will be increasingly evident as the volume and quality of investment deteriorate and Russia is being deprived of the advanced technologies needed to support its war and its growth. We expose Russia’s propaganda, disinformation and interference and information manipulation orchestrated by Putin’s regime. I invite all of you to watch and share the EU versus disinformation website and its social media, counting to continue raising awareness on this threat. We have cut our dependency on Russian gas. The value of European Union imports from Russia fell by 82 % between February 2022 and December 2023. An 82 % decrease means almost vanishing. We have reduced our dependency on Russian gas imports from 40 % of our total imports in 2021 to 15 % in 2023, and with our sanctions we have not only successfully diversified away from Russian fossil fuels, but curtailed Russia’s ability to weaponize its energy supplies, cut major revenue streams of the Kremlin and supported lower energy prices in Europe after the big boost over the last summer. Honourable Members, all that is okay, well done, but we have to continue doing more and quicker. We have to continue supporting Russian independent media, civil society and human rights activists inside and outside Russia. We have to support Russian NGOs and human rights defenders. They deserve to receive our support, and we assist Russian-language independent media and journalists. The European Union institutions and its Member States have already provided Ukraine with the quite big figure of EUR 96 billion of support. We are reaching the EUR 100 billion of support to Ukraine, and inside this figure 31 billion are military support. In addition to that, there is the macro-financial, humanitarian and other kinds of support. Some may say, ‘oh, it is very expensive to support Ukraine’, but not to support Ukraine and let Ukraine fall in front of the Russian aggression will be much more expensive for us and for the generations to come, because Russia would become a bigger threat to our security and freedom. Yes, we have to support Ukraine for as long as it takes, putting into action all our capacities – financial and military. Honourable Members, this is a good occasion to commit on continuing to uphold the human rights of all Russians, because we have nothing against the Russian people. Neither us nor the Ukrainians are in war with the Russian people. They are just defending from a regime that uses war in order to change their political system and to cancel their independency and sovereignty, and we are supporting them and offering unwavering support to Ukraine, not just because it is our neighbour but because it is our partner – one of the most important partners and now a candidate to become a member of the European Union – and its independency, its sovereignty, its territorial integrity is also part of our capacity to continue living in freedom. So please support the action taken by the European Institutions and Member States to continue supporting Ukraine and make clear that the last elections in Russia have not been either free or fair.",-,2024-04-10,19.

As a result of agreement on public security, Chinese police officers will soon begin patrolling in tourist locations in Hungary, just like they have done in Serbia. So if it isn't foreign meddling in EU affairs, then I really don't know what is. And this was willingly invited by the Orbán Government. I have to add that it is quite ironic that the government that is constantly rambling about sovereignty, pledging to protect it from Brussels, then invites foreign police forces from a totalitarian dictatorship into its territory. This problem reaches far beyond Hungary. It has serious implications on EU law enforcement and security collaboration, and also no Chinese dissident residing in the EU will ever feel safe again. Is this the Union we aspire to be? This cannot go unaddressed, so we need the Commission to put forward an EU-level strategy to counter foreign meddling, also the type that is originating within Member States.",Renew,2024-04-10,24.

Luke Ming Flanagan,"Mr President, it’s good to see such a big crowd. With regard to the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the Court of Auditors, the Court of Justice, the European Ombudsman, the European Data Protection Agency and the EPPO, as rapporteur, I will be supporting the discharge of all these institutions. I would, however, in particular, like to see more cooperation between the Committee of the Regions and the EESC. There is more that can be done – one medical service for starters. And, I have to say, I enjoyed engaging with all these groups and getting to understand them more. And I would like to be able to talk about them more but I won’t with the time. I just want to say thanks to everyone for cooperating. With regards to the Council, thanks for nothing. Nothing for 20 years. You’re doing a damn good job at aiding and abetting Eurosceptics in saying that this project is a joke. I don’t think it is, which are making it a bit of a joke. I would, however, like to focus on the European External Action Service and the genocide that’s taking place in Gaza. As you may know, I decided to withdraw my name from the file because I cannot be associated to dangerous and unsubstantiated attacks, to the backbone of the humanitarian response in Gaza and to an irreplaceable actor in the region. I’m obviously talking about UNRWA. First, there is no proof that EU taxpayers’ money has been used by Hamas following the 7 October attacks – and, by the way, history didn’t start on 7 October. The Commission carried out a review of the EU’s financial assistance to Palestine, and its conclusion is clean and positive, and I’ll quote them: ‘Through the review the Commission has preliminary screened a large portfolio of over 100 open projects benefiting Palestine, conducting a feasibility and risk assessment analysis. This analysis has not identified breaches of contractual obligations.’ Furthermore, concerning the involvement of the 12 staff members out of 13 000 employees by UNRWA and Gaza, not only have the agency terminated their contracts immediately, but the UN has also opened an investigation without delay and appointed an independent review group. Suspending funds to funds to UNRWA would mean leaving 2.2 million people in Gaza without help, despite unprecedented challenges, including access impediments and the lack of security for humanitarian workers – by the way, there’s 177 UNRWA colleagues dead at this stage – the agency staff continues to assist civilians affected by the hostilities. Over 1 million people are sheltering in the agency’s facilities across the strip, receiving vital assistance. This Parliament has already rejected, on several occasions, the request for suspension. Please let’s make sure we continue that policy. Redirecting funds from UNRWA to other partners is equal to opening the doors to chaos in the region, ignoring all the basic needs of Palestinian refugees. No other agency is mandated and has the ability to provide government-like services, including education and primary healthcare. It is about security. It is about human decency and respect for the lives of millions of people who have been subjected to years of oppression. Additionally, let me state a simple fact: this agency does not have control over EU funding in Palestine. I’ll finish by talking about the amendment for the chairperson to the Committee. The amendment, which I’m ashamed to say, passed. The amendment, which meant I couldn’t possibly support the report. This particular part of the amendment sticks in my throat: ‘Asks the EEAS to use other trusted partners in Gaza.’ Sorry, Ms Hohlmeier, but the EEAS are trusted partners. I’ll finish by saying this: casting doubt on this agency has emboldened the IDF to target all relief agencies, including those working for the World Central Kitchen, that the IDF murdered in cold blood. When you greenlight the targeting of aid workers, you leave them all open to attack. Be careful with your words. We need those words removed from that report – I certainly won’t vote for it otherwise.",The Left,2024-04-10,26.

Margaritis Schinas,"Mr President, honourable Members, Minister, as I said in my opening statement, foreign interference poses a real threat to the European Union, to our Member States, and to open societies across the globe. We are always against and take very seriously any attempts to interfere by foreign actors, any attempted threats or intimidation against the sovereign territories of EU Member States. China’s hybrid threats, including information manipulation, are a challenge to our security and we need to address them. The EU-China strategic outlook from March 2019 already reflected this, and we have raised this issues with China in bilateral meetings. We are, of course, following very closely the reports on China’s Public Security Bureau/overseas police stations allegedly established in several EU Member States. And we will continue to support these Member States to maintain law and order and safeguard internal security on their own soil. We must never, ever let any third countries threats or intimidation go without a response. Especially now, two months ahead of the European elections, I would like to take this debate as an opportunity to condemn, in the strongest terms, any attempt of any third party, state or non-state, to infect our democracies with hate and disinformation. If we want to defend our democracy and our way of life, we have to defend it ourselves. We do not need to rely on shields or umbrellas held by others.

Didier Reynders,"Monsieur le Président, Monsieur le secrétaire d’État, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, je voudrais me concentrer sur les sujets particuliers couverts par le débat d’aujourd’hui, à savoir la procédure au titre de l’article sept et la situation budgétaire. As regards the Article 7 procedure, the Commission has had the opportunity to explain on different occasions that it shares an important number of the concerns expressed by the European Parliament in its reasoned proposal that triggered this procedure in 2018. The Commission has made clear that whatever position the Council will be taking on the Article 7 procedure, it must ensure a fair handling of the proposal tabled by the Parliament. The Commission always stands ready to participate in hearings and state of play in the Council and is of the view that the procedure should be maintained as long as the issues that triggered it are not solved. As you know, the Commission also addresses the respect of the EU common values in Hungary and various work strands which run in parallel with the Article 7 procedure. As the President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, stated during the January plenary session, Hungary’s access to EU funds is also about the fundamental values that bring us together. When this Commission took office, we promised to safeguard the rule of law in the Union while treating all Member States equally. This has been a priority for us. That is why the Commission has published its annual Rule of Law Reports, and we have used all the instruments available to protect both the EU values and the EU financial interests. Our goal has always been to push for reforms in all the Member States. The Commission has relied on the recommendations from the Rule of Law Report to identify the criteria for Hungary to access EU funding. This has been notably the case under the Recovery and Resilience Facility and regarding the horizontal enabling condition linked to the respect of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. In May last year, Hungary passed a new law setting up a justice reform that addresses the relevant recommendations from the 2022 Rule of Law Report. This law strengthens judicial independence and limits the possibility of political interference in the judiciary. This was required for Hungary to meet the conditions for accessing reimbursements from cohesion policy funds. This is what we requested and this is what Hungary delivered after long and intense discussions. The decisions taken in this regard relating to the horizontal enabling conditions fall under the responsibility of my colleague, Commissioner Schmit. The Commission has kept the Parliament regularly briefed about this process and stands ready to provide updates anytime. The Commission considers that it acted in full compliance with EU law and will defend its decision of last December concerning access to certain cohesion policy funds, including before the EU court. Funding is still suspended under the horizontal enabling conditions linked to the respect of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights for concerns relating to LGBTIQ rights, academic freedom and asylum rights. Funding is also blocked under the general regime of conditionality for the protection of the EU budget, notably when it comes to issues linked to the fight against corruption and the transparency of public procurements, as well as academic freedom. This instrument is under the responsibility of my colleague, Commissioner Johannes Hahn. Finally, no regular payments can be made at this stage from the Recovery and Resilience Facility, as Hungary still does not meet all the ‘super milestones’ under its recovery plan. These funds will remain blocked until Hungary fulfils all the necessary conditions. Hungary has received some pre-financing under REPowerEU like any other Member State, as requested by the applicable regulation. This pre-financing is not subject to any condition for any Member States. As you know, the European Parliament’s reasoned proposal triggering the Article 7 procedure against Hungary covers a wide range of issues; judicial independence is only one of them. Other concerns remain, as I touched upon, including as regards corruption, freedom of expression and the right to equal treatment. Permettez-moi de conclure en soulignant que pour la Commission, il est important que le Conseil maintienne, comme cela a été annoncé à son ordre du jour, la procédure article sept jusqu’à ce que toutes les préoccupations qui la sous-tendent aient été traitées de manière satisfaisante. La Commission est prête, comme toujours, à poursuivre le dialogue sur toutes ces questions avec les autorités hongroises, au niveau tant technique que politique, afin de résoudre les problèmes qui subsistent. Je vous remercie bien entendu pour votre attention, mais je serai à l’écoute de vos interventions.",-,2024-04-10,25.

Margaritis Schinas,"Madam President, honourable Members, this debate showed that there is a high level of convergence and common ground on what we want to achieve with this reform of the pharmaceutical sector. I wish once again to congratulate the European Parliament rapporteurs for the quick progress made so far. I also heard your voices and arguments on a number of key issues where your position differs from the proposal we made. And, beyond these differences, I am sure that we can join forces and work together to achieve more for patients in the EU. To ensure that something that is an integral part of the European way of life: that wherever they live, patients must have the same opportunities to reach medicines. We will do this. At the same time, we can make the system more attractive to the pharma sector by shaping rules that are competitive, innovation-friendly so that Europe stays on the cutting edge and keeps this sector as the European champion it currently is. We will do this too. And to do this, we don’t need warnings or messages in the metro stations to tell us: we know we will do it. The reform of EU pharmaceutical rules is the opportunity to reach these objectives, which, I repeat, are not in opposition, are not antithetical. We can design a system that is more sustainable and stands for the next 20 years. I want to assure this House that we will support the co-legislators in this process. This is a reform which goes at the core of what we now call the European Health Union, which is one of the biggest success stories of the current European political cycle. A success story, if I may add, which has not been sufficiently told to Europeans. We still have two months to say so. This is a success that is not exclusive to the Commission; it belongs to all EU institutions working together, delivering for Europe, for citizens, patients and the industry.",-,2024-04-10,18.

Clare Daly,"Mr President, I voted against the pact because it’s a bonanza for the defence and arms industry, which profits so handsomely from the wars and instability that make people refugees and migrants in the first place. It’s a scam: a massive transfer of public money straight into the pockets of the security industries. It’s billions being spent on walls and drones and spy tech, on contractors and consultants and border guards, on all of the expensive, deadly trappings of pushback, detention and surveillance. Billions taken from the things we need: health, housing, education and childcare. And this deal won’t stop migration. It probably won’t even slow it down. But it will kill plenty of people who have no choice but to leave their homes because of the policies we implement. And it will murder international law and the right to asylum. So we need to organise against the elites who are taking our money and giving it to the rich, not the poor.

Long before it engaged in its genocidal attempt to obliterate Gaza, Israel had turned Gaza into an open-air prison. The Asylum and Migration Pact will further consolidate, encourage and facilitate the warehousing of asylum seekers. The so-called solidarity mechanism allows Member States to pay into a fund to strengthen borders, and to pay countries outside the EU to actively prevent migrants from entering the EU. This pact will mean increasing use of detention, even for families and children. This is the debt of the individual right to asylum as we know it. This is not how we should treat people.

Mick Wallace,"Mr President, last night we hosted a packed event in Parliament where the UN Special Rapporteur, Francesca Albanese, presented her UN report, ‘Anatomy of a Genocide’, a report that everybody should read. Analysing Israel’s patterns of violence since 8 October, Albanese concludes that the threshold indicating Israel’s commission of genocide has been met and that Israel has committed three acts of genocide with the requisite intent: killing members of the group, causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group and deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part. Israel is guilty of genocide – the crime of crimes – because we have afforded them impunity for their crimes against the Palestinians for 76 years. Words are not enough. We need arms embargoes. We need the Association Agreement suspended.

Not only no condemnation, but defence of Israel against retaliation. So last week Ecuador follows suit, sends armed heavies into Mexico’s embassy, snatching an asylum claimant – an assault on refugee and diplomatic law. Of course, the US has never respected international law. It was always one law for their friends and another for everybody else. But after six months of throwing international law on the bonfire in Gaza, something is broken. We are in freefall. Strikes on hospitals – normalised. On aid convoys, refugees, civilians – normalised. Famine as a weapon of war – normalised. All with impunity.

Never before has Europe exported more produce by volume or value, according to the EU Commission. The real culprit is plain to see: booming profits for agri-business while farmers get paid a pittance. Where is the equity? Cutting environmental measures vital for protecting nature and food security will not fix our broken food system. Passing the EU-Mercosur trade deal will certainly not improve farmers’ incomes.

Andrey Novakov,"Mr President, Commissioner, this report took me almost a year of hard work and a lot of meetings, and I’m grateful to have a chance to work with all the shadow rapporteurs and the head of DGs that I’ve met, all of them, during the process of drafting this report. At the very beginning, I was open to listening to different opinions, including the one why we need to have a discharge on Parliament – it means that the Parliament is discharging itself. And I think this is a duty of ours, because this is the utmost transparency that we can show. We are the one to grant discharge on administration and the way our budget is spent, and it’s public, and it’s available to everyone who is interested in how the taxpayers’ money is used, even during crisis. Just to recall, during COVID-19, no one had a rulebook how to behave. We didn’t know when the crisis would be over. We didn’t know that the prices of energy would go so high. We didn’t know that the war would start. We didn’t know that the transport sector, because of COVID-19, would collapse and we would not be able to travel. And, regardless of all these things, we found a way to survive, to adapt our way of functioning and not spend even one cent of European taxpayers’ money for something which was not necessary or was against the rules. And I’m proud that the leadership of the European Parliament for that period followed the rules and did not use those difficult times in a way to use the budget in an inappropriate way. So you can be proud that we manage this as a team, and those who are coming right after us in the next mandate could follow this example.

Katalin Cseh,"Mr President, dear colleagues, here we are facing yet another foreign interference scandal. There are credible allegations that Russian proxies have paid MEPs and candidates to spread their propaganda. It is beyond outrageous. But it is just as infuriating to see that our safeguards are just not up for the task. After the allegations broke, Renew Europe demanded a thorough investigation and real consequences – and I’m sorry to say, but we are not satisfied. So this is why we have tabled amendments to the discharge file to better protect the Parliament from interference, calling for an urgent investigation. We must also enhance our security culture to provide mandatory training, ensure appropriate clearance and strengthen the screening of staffers. It is just absurd that somebody can just walk into a meeting of foreign and security affairs without proper background checks. What else needs to happen for real action? Actual Russian operatives showing up at our chambers? So, colleagues, enough should be enough. Please support our amendment and work with us for ironclad safeguards against foreign interference.",Renew,2024-04-10,26.

Tony Murphy,"Mr President, State Secretary Michel, Commissioner Hahn, rapporteurs for the different bodies and honourable Members, it’s a pleasure to be here, to give an overview of ECA’s 2022 annual report. Once again, I’m very happy to be supported by my esteemed colleague, who is responsible within the court, Jan Gregor, for the presentation and preparation of the annual report. I think our annual reports hold significant importance as they serve as the centrepiece of our efforts to address the challenges faced by the European Union in terms of managing the EU budget. And they are also a key contribution to this discharge procedure, which Commissioner Hahn has said is the last one within this legislative procedure. While I have already discussed the main findings of our annual report in the plenary session last October, today I would just like to give a very brief overview of the key messages contained therein. As in previous years, we have no issues with the opinion on the EU accounts, nor on the revenue. In terms of expenditure, for the second time, we have two separate opinions, reflecting that there are fundamental differences between the budget spending under the MFF, the Multi Financial Framework and the RRF spending. Starting with the spending related to the MFF, we saw an increase in the overall level of irregularities, rising to 4.2 % from 3.0 % the previous year. Given the widespread occurrence of the errors identified, we have maintained an adverse opinion for the fourth consecutive year. The cohesion policy area continues to be the main driver of the increase in our overall error rate. It represents the EU’s largest policy area, accounting for 40 % of our audited expenditure. And for this policy area, we estimate the error rate to be 6.4 % compared to 3.6 % the previous year. Moving on to our audit of the expenditure on the Recovery and Resilience Facility, here, we also have a separate opinion, which is necessitated by the distinct delivery model of the RRF, which focuses on the achievement of milestones and targets. We assessed almost all the milestones and targets included in the payments made to 11 Member States during 2022. Our conclusion is that several milestones and targets were affected by regularity issues. We also found weaknesses in the RRF control system. Based on a combination of these qualitative and quantitative considerations, we issued a qualified opinion on the RRF expenditure for 2022. It’s important to note that unlike other EU funding programmes, investment projects’ compliance with EU and national rules is not a condition for payment under RRF and therefore not covered by the Commission assessment. However, these large investment projects, which only now begin to be funded through the facility, are similar in nature to cohesion fund investments. Considering the observed significant increase in the error rate within this policy area, a risk exists that under the RRF, the EU’s financial interests would not be sufficiently protected. As we passed the halfway point of the RRF’s eligibility period, we should acknowledge we should acknowledge its contribution to the EU’s economic recovery as detailed in the Commission’s recently published mid-term evaluation report. We also must acknowledge that only over a third of the funds available for disbursement under the facility have actually been paid out to date. In fact, three EU Member States have not yet received any RRF funding and a further two have only received pre-financing. So a portion of the loans on offer amounting to EUR 90 billion will now go unused, suggesting limited interest in such financing. Furthermore, the timeline for addressing the RRF-associated debt is also rapidly approaching. While no dedicated source of EU funding has yet been created to repay it, the budget is already feeling the strain of interest charges. They could rise to as much as EUR 27 billion for the EU’s entire MFF period, doubling initial estimates. Ladies and gentlemen, as we look to the future, I believe that we find ourselves at a critical juncture within the European Union. Amidst significant debt burdens, we also face the clear prospect of enlargement, a pressing migration crisis, with parallel energy and environmental challenges, as we strive to meet ambitious green objectives. Amidst these changes, the ECA remains steadfast in its commitment to upholding accountability and transparency.",-,2024-04-10,26.

Johannes Hahn,"Mr President, dear President Murphy, dear State Secretary, dear discharge rapporteurs and honourable Members, I would like to thank, on behalf of the Commission, the European Parliament for the highly valuable and constructive exchange throughout this discharge procedure. I would like to thank, in particular, the Committee on Budgetary Control and the discharge rapporteur, Ms Muñoz, for preparing the discharge report. Thank you very much. As this is the last discharge of this legislature, I would like to focus today on what have been our main common challenges and achievements. The Union faced a number of unprecedented crises over the past years: the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and its far-reaching consequences — the surge in energy and food prices and a new macroeconomic environment with a sharp rise in interest rates and inflation — as well as a wide array of humanitarian crises and environmental disasters. The Union budget played a crucial role in enabling the European Union to respond effectively to those challenges. So I am grateful to this House for having provided continuous support for all the different measures we proposed to mitigate the consequences of all these crises and challenges. We shifted the focus of our programming: at the same time, we set up the NextGenerationEU and the Recovery and Resilience Facility to provide significant financial support to Member States, boosting investments and reforms, and effectively supporting the economic recovery in the European Union. This inevitably put pressure on Member States’ administrative and absorption capacities. During this period, the Commission has also further reinforced the budget performance framework. In 2021, the Commission adopted its communication on the performance framework for 2021-2027. This framework comprises all the tools and procedures necessary to set objectives and measures, and monitor progress towards them. Above all, it allows us to communicate effectively with stakeholders and citizens on how the budget adds value to the lives of European citizens. Notably, under this framework, the Commission has continued to integrate horizontal priorities such as climate, biodiversity and gender equality into the budget, and important progress has already been achieved. In addition, the Commission has started to implement two large-scale performance-based instruments on the 2021-2027 period, namely the Recovery and Resilience Facility and the new delivery model for the common agricultural policy. Finally, over the last years, we have also strengthened the protection of the Union budget in several ways. I would like to thank you for Parliament’s support and cooperation to reach an agreement on last year’s revision of the Financial Regulation. The final text contains significant improvements to better protect the Union budget. One of them is the extension of the early detection and exclusion system to shared management, to strengthen our capacity to exclude from funding recipients who are in breach of EU rules. Concretely, this means that two thirds of the Union budget that were previously not covered by the system will now be covered from 2028 onwards. We will also have more transparency for the public on who gets Union funding. The improved financial transparency system means that information on beneficiaries of Union funding will, in the future, be concentrated in a single place and no longer scattered over different websites. Another very important improvement is the compulsory feed of data-mining and risk-scoring tool for audit and control purposes. It will further strengthen the detection and prevention of fraud, corruption, conflicts of interest and double-funding. I would also like to mention two other key achievements from this legislature, which are crucial to strengthening the protection of the budget. First, the entry into force of the Conditionality Regulation in 2021. Here, for the first time, the Union has a specific tool designed to remedy adverse effects of breaches of the principles of the rule of law in a Member State on the financial interests of the Union and the Commission implemented it. Secondly, the set-up of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, which started its operation in 2021. Within their respective mandates, OLAF’s and the EPPO’s activities are complementary in protecting the Union’s financial interests. Effective cooperation between OLAF and EPPO is therefore essential. More generally, the Commission has kept on closely working with Member States and other partners to implement European funds in a reasonable manner. To conclude, I would like to emphasise that the Commission upholds the highest standards of transparency and accountability. The Commission remains committed to ensuring that the European Union budget and NextGenerationEU are spent in line with the applicable rules and deliver results on the ground. The Commission stands, of course, ready to follow up on the European Parliament’s concerns.",-,2024-04-10,26.

Michal Wiezik,"Mr President, let me first thank the European Court of Auditors (ECA) for their thorough audits, as well as for the clarifications and open cooperation with joint undertakings. Tomorrow, we are due to vote on discharge for nine joint undertakings. The reports follow the ECA annual report for the 2022 financial year and the individual annual reports on the joint undertakings and present some observations to improve their sound financial management further. Joint undertakings can be set up under the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU or Euratom Treaty as public-private partnerships between the EU and industry, research groups and Member States. They play a crucial role in groundbreaking EU research, development and demonstration programmes aiming at bringing the EU to the forefront of sustainable development in the world and responding to European social challenges that are currently insufficiently served by industry. The JUs operating under the 2021-2027 MFF implement their specific research and innovation agenda in sustainable transport, fusion energy, health, circular bio-based industries, key electronic components, supercomputing and network systems. Each has a distinct legal personality and adopts its own financial rules in line with the Financial Regulation, and they operate under the Euratom and Horizon Europe programmes. On 15 November 2023, the ECA published its specific annual report on JUs in the form of a consolidated report. Overall, the Court’s audit of the JUs for the financial year ending on 31 December 2022 confirmed similar results reported in previous years. In the annual process of granting discharge, we endorse the ECA’s recommendations and conclude that all accounts of the joint undertakings are reliable, in accordance with international accounting standards, and with low risk to the legality and regularity of revenues and payments. Nevertheless, through the reports, we would also like to highlight some further improvement in the coming financial years, in particular the need for improvement in programme implementation, human resources, and management and control systems. Given the systemic errors for declared personnel costs, we asked the JUs to strengthen their internal control systems for payments, especially by those beneficiaries that are more prone to errors, such as SMEs and newcomers. Regarding the risk expressed by the ECA in relation to the costs and deadlines for the ITER project in which Russia participates, we advise to remain attentive to events that may affect the implementation of the programme and exploring alternative supply flows should delivery problem arise. ITER is truly a groundbreaking programme with the ambition to produce unlimited energy on Earth. However, since the war in Ukraine, Russia’s membership has proven unreliable and very problematic as regards the delivery of components and risk of inflated costs. Therefore, we stress that this situation presents a high risk of delays and higher costs for the ITER project, where the EU takes the lead with more than a 45% share of construction costs. To conclude, I am fully convinced that all JUs represent successful European undertakings. All of them are operating within the merits of common rules.",Renew,2024-04-10,26.

Andrey Novakov,"Mr President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, as we gather here today to address the discharge procedure of 2022, I am compelled to reflect upon the extraordinary challenges that we as a Union faced during that time. I still remember vividly the issues that we had to tackle: the consequences of COVID, the beginning of the war – everything happened back then. I kept my promise, with a well-structured report, which focused only on the work of the Parliament, having in mind what happened during that year. In the face of such challenges, it was imperative that we, as the European Parliament, demonstrated leadership and consistency. We had to navigate through the crisis while upholding the values and principles upon which our Union was founded. Despite what was happening in Europe, we had also our own problems here in the House to solve. I am proud to say that our leadership rose to the occasion, taking decisive steps to maintain trust in the European decision-making process. We strengthened the transparency, ethics and rightful conduct within our institutions. They became paramount and I commend on our efforts in this regard. As the rapporteur of the discharge report of the European Parliament, my primary goal was to provide a factual assessment of the financial implementation of the European Parliament budget for the year 2022. I aim to scrutinise how external events – such as the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis – affect our budgetary execution and how our institution responded to these challenges. Throughout this process, I have the privilege of working closely with Parliament’s administration. Their invaluable assistance has been instrumental in enabling us to fulfil our mandate effectively. Here I have to say that the structure of the report is a bit innovative, compared to the few last reports that we have on that issue before. We had a DG-by-DG approach, having in mind that each DG has specific issues, a specific approach to different challenges, so we keep it objective. Therefore, we need to express our gratitude and support for the tireless efforts of the administration. While we must continuously strive for positive reforms and improvements, we must also acknowledge and appreciate the dedication of those who serve in our institution. As a Bulgarian but also a dedicated European, I am deeply committed to promote transparency and fostering a modern democracy that truly represents the diverse views of all EU citizens. It is my firm belief that the European Parliament stands as a beacon of democratic values and principles, and it is our collective responsibility to uphold and strengthen these foundations. I am pleased to say that those values have been defended throughout the pages of my report, and I am certain that we would have a valuable final result tomorrow during the vote.",PPE,2024-04-10,26.

Malin Björk,"Mr President, I find it completely mad and even auto-destructive, the Council accepting the Fidesz government to hold the EU presidency. A country that has dismantled democracy since 2010, attacking media freedom, the independence of the judiciary, targeting NGOs, targeting academic freedoms. A government that has systematically attacked migrant rights, women’s rights, LGBTI rights. A country that is under Article 7 procedure for breaches of rule of law. However, to let them hold the presidency is also a sign. It is a sign giving in to the nationalist right. It is to give them legitimacy in their project – in their anti-democratic and very dangerous project. But I must also say it is never too late. Commission, don’t ever give more disbursement to an autocratic regime as Hungary – don’t do that. And the Council, you still have time to stop the presidency of Viktor Orbán. Why are you not acting?

Yet another Russian-inspired law has been promulgated, this time under the guise of protecting national sovereignty. Anything that could be considered as likely to violate or jeopardise the sovereignty of Hungary is now considered to be a crime, and can be punished under criminal law. Of course, the notion of sovereignty is immensely broad and vague, potentially making almost everyone is suspect in Hungary. It means that criticising the government in Hungary will now be dangerous, as it will officially make you, in legal terms, a traitor. Once again, civil society activists, journalists and political opponents are under threat and the president of the so-called Sovereignty Protection Office has already officially spoken of broadening the scope of this law, as well as the targets.

Pernille Weiss,"Madam President, thank you all so much for the debate. Thank you, Commissioner Schinas, for your closing remarks – very appreciated – and also thank you for saying that the Parliament took the proposal from the Commission. We preserved what was strong and good in it, but we also developed and made more value into the Commission’s proposal. Thank you for acknowledging that. That’s very much appreciated. I said a couple of times in my first intervention, I used the word ‘ecosystem’ in my speech, and I use that very, very precisely. I also invite more colleagues, more commentators, more stakeholders to acknowledge that healthcare in Europe really is a very complex ecosystem. We can expect and we must expect a lot from the pharma package. But it is not the only legislative package that can make healthcare in Europe develop in a more innovative and a more citizens- and patient- and family-friendly way. I really appreciate the colleagues who mentioned that in your interventions. My dear colleague Vistisen from Denmark, the Spitzenkandidat from ID, has left the room. But before he did, and in his intervention, he actually took the work we have made, and where his Group has also been a part of that, and tossed it into the bin – also saying that if it was stood to his opinion, this House should not touch the pharmaceutical legislation because we don’t know what we are dealing with. That stands in contrast to the comments we have already received from commentators and stakeholders that what we are now about to vote is something that is much more coherent, much more pragmatic and much more liveable for the future of this file going now towards trilogue. I thank you again, all colleagues who contributed. I am not running again, so this file will not be a part of my future. But I will watch what you do with this file going forward.

Johannes Hahn,"Mr President, thank you for this final exchange of views before the vote on the discharge on the budget implementation 2022. I also would like to thank the Court of Auditors, namely the President and the Rapporteur, Jan Gregor, for the excellent cooperation. I can confirm we are not always agreeing, but I also agree that we have different roles and at the end of the day, there is a very large agreement about fundamentals. We pursue and follow the same objectives, meaning to respect and to guarantee the correct use of taxpayers’ money. So on this we are both quite successful. The discharge process allows us to learn from the past in order to improve for the future, not least thanks to the thorough exchanges of views organised almost constantly by the Committee on Budgetary Control under the leadership of Monika Hohlmeier, or, in the words of John le Carré, ‘tomorrow was created yesterday’. Therefore, it’s important to look into how we performed in 2022, in order to learn for 2024 and 2025. Clear and simple rules remain the best way to guarantee the sound financial management of European Union spending. The Commission has therefore continued its efforts to simplify rules and raise awareness of beneficiaries with communication campaigns, workshops and guidance. We need, however, to do more to extend the use of simplified forms of funding. The Commission will also continue working together with its partners, especially Member States and national authorities, on the shared management to address the weaknesses identified and take preventive measures, such as sharing good practices, providing guidance and training to the management control and audit structures in Member States. Because for the future, we need to be even more reliable on the performance and work of the respective institutions and bodies in Member States. So therefore whenever necessary, the Commission will not hesitate to have recourse to corrective mechanisms. Concerning the Recovery and Resilience Facility, the Commission will continue to involve all relevant stakeholders for a successful implementation of the Facility. We will also maintain close engagement with the European Parliament and the Council all along the implementation of the Facility. I would like to reassure you of the Commission’s continuous commitment to work together with the European Parliament in ensuring adequate protection of European Union financial interests and values. The Commission stands ready to follow up on the European Parliament’s concerns. Finally, I have to say and to stress again that I am grateful also on behalf of my team, be it in the Cabinet or in the DG BUDG General Directorate, for the cooperative, constructive and positive spirit between the institutions involved in the discharge debate.

Seán Kelly,"A Uachtaráin, I’m coming from Ireland South, an awful lot of our jobs are farmer jobs, and they invest hugely in the economy. And for that reason, I was delighted that the original proposal by the Commission to reduce market protection from eight to six years was not accepted because it would have driven a lot of the research out of Europe. For every research project that’s successful, there are nine, ten, maybe a lot more that aren’t successful – so they need that protection. That’s good. Also, I welcome the streamlining of the approval process at EMA level, because this then should make medicines available to those who need them right across the European Union in a much quicker and more efficient manner, and also in a cheaper situation. So this is a very good package. I think it will work well both for the industry and, above all, for patients right across the European Union, and I think a good job was done.

Your Majesty, it was a pleasure for me and my colleagues to celebrate the 70th Anniversary of the European Parliament together with you last year in Laeken. This year, it is a privilege for the European Parliament to welcome you in our Brussels hemicycle, while Belgium holds the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union. Brussels – the centre of Europe – is the host of many European institutions and the home of the European Parliament. We are grateful to be here and thousands of Europeans serving Europe are proud to call Belgium home. Belgium – a founding European member – has played a leading role in developing our Union, always protecting European ideals and advocating for European values. Last January, the visit of Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo to this Parliament was an opportunity to outline the importance of the Belgian Presidency. It closes off an intense five-year legislative cycle marked by unprecedented challenges. I am proud of how the European Parliament has stepped up to meet them. Indeed our Parliament still has an intense workload here today – and until the very last plenary sitting of this legislature – in order to continue to deliver, as we have already done, on what European citizens expect from our European Union. In 60 days from today, the people of Belgium – including for the first time those aged 16 and 17 – will be invited to vote for the 22 Members of the European Parliament that will represent their interests and steer Europe for the next five-year term.

We have discussed, colleagues, for years, the CAP proposal. For years. And we approved it as a Parliament, by the way. You approved it as a Parliament. We Greens voted against the CAP because it’s an unjust and unfair system. Therefore, we do understand the protests of the farmers, because it is true that the current economic system is unfair to our farmers. The profits are with the big agrochemical industry and not the farmers. Therefore, we have seen fundamental problems in our agriculture system. Over the last 20 years, one third of farmers have disappeared in Europe because of a failing economic system. These proposals will not solve anything and the Commission knows: there is no impact assessment; there is no legal assessment yet.

AMR is a suicide killer that can cause the next pandemic. Resistant pathogens threaten us not only directly, but also indirectly.

Therefore, it is a step forward to support research and development of new antibiotics. However, AMR is one health topic.

Margaritis Schinas,"Madam President, honourable Members, today we’re here to discuss an important reform – the reform of our European pharmaceutical legislation. This is the most important reform in almost two decades. It is a long overdue reform, because in the last 20 years, many things have changed. The world has changed. So we need to adjust. From the very start, our objective for this package was clear: to ensure timely and equal access to medicines for all Europeans, regardless of where they live in the Union, whilst at the same time fostering innovation and competitiveness for our industry. Contrary to certain arguments that these objectives are antagonistic or do not combine, I want to take this opportunity today to say that we think that they are both compatible and perfectly feasible. We can respond, with this reform, both to the needs of the patient and the expectations of the market. Indeed, our pharmaceutical sector, our pharmaceutical industry is a European champion. The EU is the second largest market in the world for pharmaceuticals, and pharma represents the biggest single contributor to our trade surplus. So having a robust regulatory environment matters. It matters a lot. Coming now to patients, we also have inequality and difficulties there. Patients in bigger and wealthier Member States get their medicines first and faster whilst, at the same time, waiting time for patients to have access to new medicines varies from a few months to up to two years across the EU. This has to change, and it is precisely these objectives are what are driving our reform. These two arguments are two sides of the same coin. We are reforming legislation having in mind three main priorities: first, wider access to medicines through incentives to reward innovation and supply; number two, cheaper medicines through earlier availability of generics and biosimilars; and number three, faster rules, faster procedures, simplification so that the EU and its industry will remain globally competitive. This is not a theory. This is something that will bring concrete, tangible change on the ground. New medicines will reach 70 million more patients in the EU, especially in areas where treatments are lacking, like rare diseases and paediatric cancers. For the industry, this would entail savings between EUR 500 million to EUR 1 billion over the next 15 years. This is a win win situation. Honourable Members, I would like to commend this House, the rapporteurs, the shadows, all those involved, because you gave this file all the priority it deserves, and you delivered so quickly. The main elements of what we proposed have been retained, in particular the set-up of an incentive system that is modulated and geared towards results. Other elements of our proposals have been further developed, like the notions of regulatory sandboxes or incentives for priority antimicrobials, and new ideas have been introduced on joint procurement, on Hera, for example. Some of these proposals raise questions about effectiveness, visibility, red tape, sustainability of health systems. Still, all your thoughts and ideas form a basis for sound interinstitutional discussions. In the Council, Member States have not yet developed a mandate, so the Commission will reserve our position, but we are sure that we can look forward to the next steps and hold honest negotiations based on facts. By the end of this month, we will launch a coalition to address a collateral but yet connected and burning issue – the one on how to avoid shortages of the most pressing medicines. This will take the form of a Critical Medicines Alliance, under which we will mobilise all stakeholders for the benefit of society. In concluding, let me reiterate that we are now facing a great opportunity to create a single market for medicines and one that is fair, future-proofed and globally competitive. Let’s seize this moment. Let’s take this opportunity. This is what Europe knows best – smart, proportionate and effective regulation.",-,2024-04-10,18.

It’s one of our most important industrial sectors. It employs directly more than 840 000 people in Europe and invests over EUR 40 billion annually in research and development. These figures are significant, but the pace of growth and investments in comparison to regions such as Asia and the United States are significantly higher. It means that incentives for pharmaceutical and development research and new innovations in Europe must be increased. Otherwise, there is a risk of new investments increasingly flowing to other parts of the world.

The pact definitely contains problematic elements, risks and weaknesses and it is dishonest to deny that. But it is equally dishonest to claim that this pact is the end of the right to asylum, or that, in itself, it will lead to more violence at the borders. The violence today is not the result of the existing law, but of national policies and the absence of enforcement. I can defend the new Reception Conditions Directive without any hesitation, and those standards (which I had the pleasure to negotiate) will apply across the package. And if I had written the pact, it would look very different. But there will not be any fresh proposals on the table or a better negotiation result. It is false to create that impression and our job does not end here. We have an even bigger task in overseeing implementation and enforcement, and the best guarantee for European values is a solid majority of European liberal democrats who stand tall for human rights.

Malin Björk,"Madam President, I have heard many arguments today, but the one I’ve heard most is: we have to have a deal. We just have to have a deal. But a deal must be judged on its contents. I repeat why we in The Left will vote against this deal. There is no solution to solidarity. There is no shared responsibility to receive asylum seekers. There is no stop to the death in the Mediterranean. Nothing. There will be systematic detention in the borders of Europe. The right to asylum will be dismantled. And there will be more deals with dictators and anti-democratic regimes. Just hear those arguments. So, in The Left, we stand for fundamental rights. We also stand with all those organisations that are demonstrating now outside this building. But they are also working every day to save lives, to demonstrate what it is with solidarity. Look at them and listen to them, please. People here like to say that we are anti-European; I would say you are anti-European. We defend a Europe that stands up for fundamental rights. What do you think people want in the future? What do you think the young people of Europe want? They want a Europe that stands for democracy, human rights, solidarity and fundamental rights. They want workers’ rights and they want climate justice. That’s the Europe they want to build, and they are not okay with us taking decisions that dismantle that future. You say we play into the hands of the far right. I would laugh if it wasn’t so serious. You are walking in their shoes. You are following on their leash, in their narrative, pitting people against each other, pitting migrants and refugees against workers, against young people, against families. You must stop. Instead, start to defend people’s rights – all people’s rights – because that’s the future that we have promised to build together for this Europe: a Europe that protects people, that doesn’t deny them rights.

Tomas Tobé,"Madam President, Commissioner, I think it is clear for everyone that is watching what is happening on the ground today, and they understand that we need to have a new European migration policy. We have horrific numbers of people dying in the Mediterranean Sea. We still see that the majority of people coming to Europe are irregular migrants. We see that we have a lack of trust between Member States, and we also see that we have a lack of trust also from citizens towards governments, towards European politicians. Now, finally, we have something on the table. We have something that is truly negotiated, and we have an opportunity now to find a constructive majority in this House to vote in favour of this migration pact. For years, this House has criticised the Council for not making up their mind, for not being ready to negotiate. Now, finally, we have the Council ready to adopt this and move forward towards a true European migration policy. Should it then be this House who rejects it? Who shows that we are not mature enough to take decisions that would actually mean that we will stick to our European values? Yes, we will have a more controlled migration policy than we have today, but we will also make a choice that we will prioritise the people in need of protection and we will decrease irregular migration. Finally, we will also open up to cooperate more within the Union and together with countries outside of Europe. This is the right path forward and I do hope, colleagues, you will please be responsible today. Please vote in favour of the Migration Pact.",PPE,2024-04-10,"17.

Margaritis Schinas,"Madam President, honourable Members, four years ago, before presenting our proposals for a new pact for migration and asylum, the situation in Europe was full of images that we didn’t like – Lampedusa, Mória, Calais, the Canaries. But contrary to those who tried to craft the argument that all this was the result of Europe’s making, we were very clear from the start that everything we didn’t like about migration was the direct consequence of the lack of Europe. This was the cost of non-Europe and this is what we are correcting today. The package that we have agreed with Member States and with the political groups is a delicate, balanced outcome. I can hear from your passionate contributions in the debate today that not all of you are happy with the result. That’s okay. That’s a good thing, because these arguments clearly point out to a balanced outcome that leaves many people in agreement, but leaves other people in the fringes, disagreeing. This is what European democracy is all about. Actually, the thing we are about, which you are about to vote on today, is the only thing that we didn’t try on migration policy in this political cycle; we did all the rest but having a regulatory framework for migration. We did crisis management. We defended our Member States against the instrumentalisation of migration flows by authoritarian neighbours. We ran from incident to incident, crisis to crisis, ship to ship. We did everything but one: to have a policy. And we are now nearing this moment. This is indeed a make-or-break moment. We are about to open the door to a new House, a packed House, which will be founded on the respect of fundamental rights and the dignity and the values we represent. Not a fortress Europe, but a well-guarded House with more secure external borders and clear rules on who is entitled to enter. A House that will provide shelter to those fleeing persecution, war and violence. A House where all asylum applications will be processed duly and fairly. A House that will also make sure that those who do not have legal rights to be under our protection should be returned to the countries of origin with speed and dignity. And these effective rules – clear, cohesive, holistic rules – will also help us make EU solidarity the new normal. Honourable Members, we are now about to vote. You are about to vote. And this is a major moment for responsibility. This is a unique chance because, frankly, it is not enough for some of you to say that we don’t want porous borders and do nothing about it. It is not enough to others to say that we want to protect the sanctity of asylum at all costs, but voting down this package. And it is not enough to say that you want to improve the rights of refugees and migrants, but stand against the legal texts that are precisely meant to do that. So this is the moment of truth. Perfection is always the enemy of progress. The pact that you have in front of you is not rebuilding the Parthenon. We never claimed to do so, but we are making a marked, tangible improvement after many years of failures. We today have a non-system for migration in Europe. This might be good for those who want to win votes from the fact that Europe cannot sort out our migration problems, but it is not good for the rest of us. It is not good for citizens. It was not good for Europe. So a vote against the pact is a vote against the Europe of solutions. I personally felt privileged and honoured to be able to accompany this historic process from day one to today. We are now about to cross the Rubicon on migration and asylum policy. We are about to show to everybody that the EU can deliver on the issues that matter to our people most. Let that be the one, single and resounding message voters will need to take when they go to vote next June.",-,2024-04-10,"17.

Seán Kelly,"A Uachtaráin, I think most people in Europe are sympathetic to the plight of migrants and asylum seekers and they welcome them. But they expect it to be done in a fair and equitable manner. Up until now, that was impossible because we had different systems across Europe. So I welcome this package. I think it will bring coordination in line with our obligations under the international treaties and conventions and will ensure that there is a cohesive and proper manner in which asylum seekers are assessed. This notion that everybody can come to Europe – legal and illegal – and stay here indefinitely; that upsets people and that’s understandable. They expect it to be done, and now we can do it in solidarity. I think once we do that and every Member State plays its part, we will help to have a proper structure and also break the power of the people smugglers who have got away with exploiting the most unfortunate people in the world for too long. Now I think we can get it done properly and fairly and show that Europe is compassionate and works in solidarity. (End of catch-the-eye procedure)",PPE,2024-04-10,"17.

Pedro Marques,"Madam President, Commissioners, colleagues, it may be easy to come here and criticise the Migration Pact. It is obviously not perfect, but it is a compromise – a moment in which Europe stops dragging its feet on migration – and therefore it is a positive moment. The Pact will establish effective procedures to manage our borders, but never giving up on huge solidarity with the refugees. That’s why the far right hates it. It will overcome national selfishness that left alone our border countries in the Mediterranean, introducing a binding solidarity mechanism between Member States. That is also why the far right hates it. It addresses the need to cooperate with origin countries. If the EU really wants to manage migration, it must cooperate on the stabilisation and development of these countries. That is also why the far right hates it. Imperfect as it might be, this is one of the milestones of these five years. The far right hates it because they will have to live with the fact that we deliver for Europeans, and, yes, we will deliver today. Catch-the-eye procedure",S&D,2024-04-10,"17.

Pernille Weiss,"Madam President, dear colleagues, today we will vote on the Parliament’s position on the revision of our general pharmaceutical legislation. A revision which is vital for patients, the industry ecosystem and our wider society. With today’s vote, we take a step towards addressing current and future challenges, as well as opportunities of our healthcare ecosystems. Europe is increasingly falling behind other regions in pharmaceutical research and development investments. Novel technology is challenging the existing legislative framework, and the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the need for timely and equitable access to medicine, which should have already been obvious to all of us. Our report on the pharmaceutical directive proposes mandatory measures to increase access to medicines across Europe, while recognising that the availability of medicine is not depending on industry decisions alone. It proposes a more efficient regulatory framework while preserving quality, safety and efficacy standards and strengthening the protection of our environment. And it proposes a framework for incentives which, like a magnet, attracts products to Europe. This shall ensure that Europeans will always, also in the future, see medicine offered as soon as possible on our markets and developed to meet our needs, namely those needs which are not met today. In less than a year, Members from all different political groups and parts of Europe came together to form this position in the midst of election season and heightened political polarisation, no less. I would like to thank all colleagues involved in bringing this file here today, namely my co-rapporteur, MEPs Wölken, for the pharmaceutical package together with me, the shadow rapporteurs across all groups, my EPP Group colleagues who negotiated the regulation, MEP Sokol, and all our colleagues and our indispensable advisers who otherwise contributed with good suggestions and debate. Everything bricks making it possible to make good legislation in a professional and empathetic atmosphere. I need not remind any colleagues of the widespread doubts regarding the Parliament reaching today’s vote. The true measure of our success lies, of course, not in this legislative milestone, but in the real impact our work will eventually have on patients’ lives. Still, and very importantly, I look at the Council and hope that they will take note not only of our ambition for a swift adoption of the final legislation, but also our commitment in this House to collaborate, inspire and eventually reach a compromise that benefits the entire health care ecosystem in all corners of Europe.",PPE,2024-04-10,18.

Balázs Hidvéghi,"Madam President, dear colleagues, today I want to talk about the real essence of the whole migration debate, because it has never really been about helping refugees – we all want to help people in need. This debate, however, in its essence, is about whether or not we are able to preserve our European identity, our way of life, norms, culture and traditions. The promotion of mass migration threatens all that. It is, in reality, a social transformation project that is imposed upon the European people without, in most cases, ever asking them about their opinion and consent. Illegal mass migration leads to the disintegration of society. It breaks down European norms. It destroys public security. The first signs of that horrible disaster are already visible in many Western European cities. Think of just France, for instance, and the brutal, horrendous murders that have become part of French life. Public safety is deteriorating. The state is losing control. Public authority is slipping out of its hands. We in Hungary haven’t given up on defending our way of life, our security and culture. The Hungarian people have been asked about this issue and they have repeatedly rejected illegal mass migration. This is why we firmly reject this Pact.",NI,2024-04-10,"17.

Tomas Tobé,"Mr President, Commissioners, today, we have an historic opportunity to finally put in place a common European migration policy. After migration crisis after migration crisis, after political failure after political failure, we can finally deliver to the European citizens. Most of us understand that if we have a common external border, we also need more common migration policy. The EPP Group will support the migration pact. We think that it is crucial that we start to take back control from the smugglers, because we need to decide who will actually enter the European Union. We need to strengthen our common border, because only so can we also ensure that we move towards a policy when we can give protection to those in need and not to irregular migrants. We also, in the migration pact, finally acknowledge that we need to cooperate also with third countries if we want to manage migration in a better way in the future. Finally, and perhaps even more important: in the migration pact, we make it clear that we need to cooperate better within the Union. It cannot be so that this comes to responsibility for a few Member States, where we try to find different ad hoc solutions. Now we make it clear that it is a responsibility for everyone to contribute. This is basically about building trust: building trust between the Member States, but also building trust from the citizens that the European politicians actually can deliver also when it comes to migration. Yes, the negotiations have been long – and let’s be honest, they have been hard, even within this House and together with the Council. But from the EPP Group, I would like to thank for the cooperation with the S&D Group and the Renew Group, and also with some responsible delegations in the ECR Group. But I still hear many colleagues in this House now that are ready to do whatever it takes to stop the migration pact. And I would like to turn to The Left Group and the Greens Group. You very often give speeches about the far right, but the truth is today you want to stop the migration pact together with Le Pen and AfD. That is the truth. You should instead vote in favour of the migration pact because then we could put a stop to the horrific numbers of deaths on the Mediterranean Sea. Don’t leave this in the hands of the smugglers. Colleagues, today we have an opportunity to send a clear message: Europe can agree also on divisive issues. Let’s move away from the political deadlock. Let’s move forward to a migration policy that actually works for everyone and that will, for certain, work better than what we have today. Vote in favour of the migration pact.

It is even more important today because developments in Hungary have provoked the creation of a new law – so-called ‘the sovereignty law’ – inspired by Russian, similar laws, of course. This new law will be further criminalisation not only of activists and journalists, but of many citizens – and just for you to have an idea, the president of this new institution working on sovereignty made an interview and some of his words were a threat directly to some of us. Tomorrow, those Hungarian MEPs in this room that publicly advocated for conditionality of funds in their own country will be considered unloyal to the sovereignty of their country, and they could be punished even for jail. Not only that, but we need a last legacy from this Parliament after five years of very hard work. It is expected by Council, most of our Perm Representation and the Commission. And just to finish, I want to recall to everyone that at the end of our term, presidency will be held by Hungary and we need to have a very clear statement coming from this Parliament in these conditions.",Greens/EFA,2024-04-10,15.

Sophia in 't Veld,"Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, big majority of Europeans want a humane and controlled European migration policy, and that is why we have to end years of chaos and inhumane circumstances, because we will not be able to explain to our voters that we end this term in chaos. We’ve witnessed in recent years the total collapse of trust between the Member States. We’ve seen pushbacks and violence at the external borders, inhumane reception conditions and asylum seekers sleeping on the streets of the richest countries on this planet. Over the past eight years, we’ve worked tirelessly for a package that is in line with our values, while the political climate is getting chillier by the day. Compromises have been reached just before Christmas with great difficulty, and I find it tragic that this House found itself defending European values against the Council because, regretfully, many governments are not upholding those same values, and they will aim to deny as many asylum claims as possible and put as many people in indefinite detention as they can, including children. That is why the European Commission needs to be tough and enforce the law that we’re going to vote today. The European Commission will have to do a lot more to convince us that it will actually enforce the new pact, because in recent years it allowed human rights violations to happen and it didn’t lift a finger, I’m sorry to say. Dirty deals with Tunisia, colleagues, cannot be considered a confidence-building measure either, for that matter. But this House also has a responsibility. We will have to hold the European Commission to account, and we have not done so for the last five years. If we’re criticising the Commission – and I am criticising the Commission – we also have to acknowledge that we let the Commission get away with it for the past five years and we didn’t lift a finger. Today in the vote, the far right will be showing its true colours. It will vote against because it doesn’t really want solutions. It wants chaos and misery to continue because that’s what they feed on. There are also colleagues who will vote against for understandable and legitimate reasons, and I share many of their concerns. But I still think that we should endorse the package because we have a responsibility as politicians – because if we reject the pact, there will be nothing in its place. There’s not going to be a better alternative, but we’ll end up with a situation where no single rule will be respected anymore and we’ll end in a race to the bottom and the end to the right of asylum in Europe. We cannot, unfortunately, legislate away an ultra-right majority because even if you reject the package, that majority will still be there and it may actually be bigger in the next term. And are you going to entrust the next Parliament with the elaboration of our asylum policies? Well, not me, colleagues, not me. With regard to my own file – the Reception Conditions Directive – we’ve obtained many guarantees and safeguards for asylum seekers, especially for the most vulnerable. We have ensured a legal representative for all unaccompanied children from the day they arrive. We made sure that the detention of children is the absolute exception and only with judicial authorisation. We’ve guaranteed asylum seekers access to education and language courses and quicker access to the labour market. We ensured specific attention for vulnerable groups like women, children and LGBTIQ people, and the standards laid down in the Reception Conditions Directive will apply to the entire package, and upholding all of these elements in the implementation of the pact is crucial, because it can only work if it has the trust of everyone. The weakness lies not in the legal text, colleagues, that is quite clear. It lies in the implementation by the Member States and enforcement by the European Commission. So today we need to prove the cynics wrong and show that asylum is a European matter requiring a European response in line with our European values – and we take responsibility.",Renew,2024-04-10,"17.

Ylva Johansson,"Mr President, honourable Members, migration is about human beings. It’s about men, women and children. When our migration policy fails, human beings pay the price. It’s time to fix our broken migration policy. Our citizens expect us to protect people fleeing war and persecution. They expect us to welcome people who come legally for work or study. But at the same time they expect us to prevent irregular arrivals and deadly journeys, and to swiftly return those who don’t have the right to stay. This is what the Pact on Migration and Asylum is all about. The Pact will help us to protect people, to protect our borders and manage migration in an orderly way. I would like to thank all the rapporteurs, the shadows and your staff. The political agreement on the table is an amazing achievement. It’s a true compromise for sure. I would especially like to thank the EPP, the S&D and the Renew Groups for your intense efforts. Thank you for the courage to compromise. It’s essential to show that courage also today in the vote. The vote will be a close one. This is a now-or-never moment. This moment will not come back. History is watching and our voters are watching. Today’s vote is about four years of intense legislative work. No, it’s in fact about eight years of intense legislative work. When we presented the Pact four years ago, no one was really passionate about it. But no one fully rejected it either. And this same truth holds today. After the four years you have worked on these proposals, you have improved it. The agreement on the table once again shows Europe can deliver for its citizens. And now it’s time to take responsibility. Four years ago the blockage was in the Council. Now the decision is in your hands. And it’s an all-or-nothing decision. All files must pass or no files will pass. The last four years we have met so often here in the Plenary to discuss our EU action on migration challenges. Shipwrecks with massive loss of life. Catastrophic fires in Lipa, in Moria. Sudden increase of arrivals in the Canaries, in Lampedusa. Every time the conclusion was: we need a European response. Every time we thought it couldn’t get any more difficult, it suddenly did. COVID. Lukashenka’s attempt to create a crisis by instrumentalising migrants. The Taliban takeover in Afghanistan. Humanitarian admissions and resettlement of people most at risk. Russia’s war of aggression – we are now hosting more than four million Ukrainian refugees. We did not let these crises overwhelm us. And you know what I realised? The more challenging the crisis, the more European our response. We did not allow these crises to distract us. All those years your patient work of lawmaking continued. The Blue Card – unblocked after many years. The Asylum Agency – unblocked. Forty-four trilogues on the negotiations on the Pact – and I attended almost all of them. Now we finally have on the table a comprehensive European approach on migration, with uniform EU rules on asylum procedures, screening at the border, quicker protection for those likely to be granted asylum, and quicker returns for those who don’t have the right to stay. New safeguards to protect vulnerable people, especially minors and families with children. Clear rules to prevent overcrowded reception centres. New, robust and independent monitoring mechanisms to uphold rights at the border. And for the first time ever: mandatory solidarity. Support to Member States under pressure will no longer be optional or improvised. In a few hours you will vote. This is your moment. You are the legislators. Our citizens are watching. A vote for the Pact will bring real change for the better. It shows Europe can compromise, Europe can manage also huge challenges. If the vote on the Pact fails, we all fail. The world is also watching. Whenever I go to third countries, they say, ‘So you come here to discuss migration? Why don’t you put your own house in order first?’ Now we can put our house in order. In February, I attended the Munich Security Conference. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Filippo Grandi, was asked, ‘If there is one single thing you can wish for to be implemented next year for better migration, what would that be?’ He answered, ‘The Pact’. Europe is watching. With the Pact we can manage one of Europe’s biggest challenges – migration – in a sustainable way, based on our values. Now I will ask you to take the final and vital step, and vote for the Pact. As some of you know, I like football very much. So let me put it like this. We are in the finals. Everything is at stake. We are not watching from the stands – we are on the pitch. The ball is rolling. Now is the time to come together as a team and to score for Europe. It can take years until we are in the final again – if ever. We have this one opportunity and we have to take it.",-,2024-04-10,"17.

Tineke Strik,"Madam President, Commissioners, we had the chance to fix a broken system – a system now in which border states bear the brunt of the responsibility, fundamental rights are flouted and impunity is the norm. This pact was our chance to share responsibility, end pushbacks, uphold the right to asylum and make reception human again. I acknowledge the improvements. I am glad that we stimulate resettlement and that for the first time Member States must offer solidarity. But I urge them to fulfil this obligation in the only meaningful way, by offering relocation. But I am extremely worried that these rules systematically lock up asylum seekers – even families with children – at the external borders, for months on end. This law erodes the rights and safeguards of asylum seekers and risks dangerous deportations. It allows for undermining the common standards, which is exactly the opposite of what we need. We need to foster a common policy based on mutual trust. So we are far from fixing the asylum system. Let us indeed take responsibility to finally get it right.",Greens/EFA,2024-04-10,"17.

Elisa Ferreira,"Madam President, honourable Members, the debate today illustrates how Russia follows a consistent pattern of violations of international law. Russia’s war against Ukraine is a blatant violation of international law – including the United Nations Charter, goes against the European Union’s objective to strengthen the multilateral rules-based order and is a threat to all countries, not just to Europe. Russia’s political leadership must be held fully accountable for the violations of international law and international humanitarian law it has committed. As long as Russia continues to wage a war of aggression against Ukraine, there can be no return to normal relations. And trying to address in particular the comments made by honourable Member Traian Băsescu and honourable Member Maria Grapini, that in the meantime left, I would like to underline in my initial words a sentence in which it was said that while the topic of Romanian treasures continues to be a bilateral issue between Romania and Russia, the European Union stands ready to support the Romanian authorities’ efforts to obtain the full restitution of its national treasure, if they so request. So, in a nutshell, the basic messages are that the European Union remains open to support Romania on the matter of restitution of its national treasure and archives by Russia. But at this moment, policy dialogues and mechanisms of cooperation with Russia are suspended following the war of aggression against Ukraine. But we are ready to take up the issue of restitution of Romanian national treasures in the future, when the situation allows. So in a very open and frank way, this is the message that the Commission can at this moment, unfortunately, give to the Parliament, thanking again the Parliament for this debate and this initiative.",-,2024-03-14,5.

The European population is ageing rapidly. The number of Europeans aged over 65 will double in the next 50 years, and the number over 80 years will treble. With a shrinking labour force – no longer able to provide for the needs of the growing number of older people – it is clear that Europe’s current attitudes towards ageing and retirement are unsustainable. Older people can and do contribute valuably to our society and the workforce. The EU needs to support social services to shift from institutional care to home and community care. By enabling older people with care needs to stay in their homes for as long as possible, their quality of life can be significantly improved, and we enable them to continue to contribute actively to their communities. They can have purpose and feel needed and we can have ikigai in Europe. Finally, I think I’m not a bad example myself of ageing actively and, hopefully, gracefully. I’m an ikigai!",PPE,2024-03-14,13.

Sara Matthieu,"Madam President, dear colleagues, for one out of five Europeans, life has become a series of painful choices. As the cost of living pushes people to the edge. They have to be careful using public transport due to the high ticket prices. They have to choose the cheapest food, or they cancel their health insurance for themselves or for their children. Going on holidays, going to a concert, that’s really out of the question, so it’s all about managing everything the cheapest way possible or even going without. And it’s youngsters, it’s women, it’s people with disabilities that run the highest risk of getting trapped in poverty and social exclusion. But the good news is, dear colleagues, we can change that. Poverty is a political choice, it’s not a natural state, and soon we will welcome the Social Summit in La Hulpe. I’ll be there, of course, to take this as an opportunity to embark on the Union’s social ambition, because if we’re serious in the fight against poverty, we need a directive on adequate minimum income, just like the Parliament has demanded. And Commission, of course, we also look forward to your legislative proposals in the next term on the right to disconnect, on mental health at work, on the right for workers for education and training.

Elisa Ferreira,"Madam President, honourable Members, people across Europe are living longer and healthier lives. At the same time, birth rates are in decline, putting pressure on our workforce. We should embrace the challenge to mobilise the older generation to make a meaningful contribution to our economies and societies where they can. This is also about giving citizens the freedom and the choice to live dignified lives because older citizens have a lot to offer: from knowledge and skills transfers in the workplace to building community and social cohesion. We should avoid reducing seniors to their purchasing power and narrowly focusing only on end-of-life issues like pensions or care, because longevity acknowledges not just ageing, but the significant shift in life length, compelling us to exploit the flexibility and capabilities of age. This is about ensuring that these extended years are healthier, that they are productive and that they are fulfilling. In order to have healthy longevity, we must promote health across the life cycle. We need to work together with social partners to adapt work practices and harness the full potential of technology to this end. We must tackle stereotypes about different generations and fight age-based discrimination. In a longevity society, we also need to recognise the needs of older people. The COVID-19 pandemic hit the European Union’s ageing population especially hard. It saw higher rates of severe illness, mental health issues and loneliness. Loneliness carries a stigma and makes it hard to tackle effectively. This is why the Commission’s Joint Research Centre has launched a data collection effort to give us a stronger knowledge base on how to prevent and how to cope with it. The Commission supports lifelong disease prevention and active ageing under the Healthier Together – EU Non-Communicable Diseases Initiative. To that end, we work with Member States on health issues relevant for an ageing population, like healthy lifestyles, prevention of non-communicable diseases, mental health and dementia. Through the EU4Health programme, we have made substantial support available for action on cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and other non-communicable diseases. By 2030, we can expect 13.4 million people to suffer from dementia in Europe. In order to mitigate its impacts, we are supporting Member States and stakeholders through a coordinated approach to prevent and manage dementia. Moreover, we have a comprehensive approach to mental health, which focuses on involving vulnerable groups like our elderly and addresses loneliness through the transfer of best practices in Member States. But we should also encourage flexible retirement schemes and workplace adaptations that recognise the value of older workers. Increased investment in lifelong learning and reskilling programmes will ensure that our ageing population remains dynamic. Additionally, urban planning must evolve to create age-friendly cities that are accessible and inclusive, promoting intergenerational interaction and community cohesion.

Seeing your savings disappear because of rising prices on basic goods and vital services, no longer being able to turn up the heating on your home because of the impact of electricity bills, no longer being able to feed yourself properly or look after your home: these are all serious concerns for people, particularly the elderly. So we can’t discuss health without discussing social inequality. And we cannot do this without recognising the economic crisis – part of which was fuelled by our suicidal response to Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. Rather than working for a diplomatic solution, we have instead penalised ourselves. And when the Pope calls for reason and rationale and dialogue, he’s vilified and demonised. This madness has to stop. We need a Europe that is suitable for all. (End of catch-the-eye procedure)",The Left,2024-03-14,13.

And what I would like to share with you is our gratitude for this discussion and to reinforce our shared commitment to improving our citizens’ health in a longevity society. I think this mutual commitment is clear. We are delivering on that commitment through concrete and ambitious actions, together with Member States and stakeholders, but with your support also. If we put healthy and active ageing and lifelong prevention higher on the political agenda, it will make a real difference in people’s lives. And let me just add a small detail of my own, bearing in mind what I have as a competence and responsibility. Cohesion policy has a lot of instruments and is being used exactly also to create conditions for this better quality of life in all regions of Europe, in all countries of Europe – trying to reply to some of you that mentioned it. We must in fact turn our ageing society into a longevity society, as put forward in the Commission’s demography toolbox. We must build a longevity society that values longer lifetime spent in older age, that empowers older citizens, and that nurtures the welfare and well-being of all generations and all society and all regions across Europe. That is how we achieve a more inclusive, sustainable and healthier society in which people of all ages can thrive and live life to the full.

Any chance that they might return that, because it is needed for humanitarian purposes in Afghanistan? We have also had UK banks who have stolen money from Venezuela.

Nicolas Schmit,"Madam President, indeed, millions of European citizens have seen their living conditions deteriorating. They have been the victims of the financial crisis. The COVID pandemic has affected them in their daily lives, followed by inflation fuelled by energy and food prices. And for all these fellow citizens, the main question is how to make ends meet every month. And this affects those people at risk of poverty. But, more and more, it also affects the so-called middle classes. And that’s why it is important for this House and the European Union to show that we really take these concerns seriously. This is important also for Europe. Poverty remains acute in Europe. It has not significantly declined in the EU over the past few years, and citizens are quite rightly concerned. In particular, child poverty, affecting about 20 million children, has even increased over recent years. Some groups remain more at risk than others. This concerns young people women, ethnic minorities and migrants in particular. Obviously, the economic and social strains we face due to the multiple crises have negatively impacted households all over Europe, leading with the increased cost of living and the reduced purchasing power and available income. We know that lower-income households are mostly affected by increases in prices, such as energy and food prices. A rising number of people have fallen into energy poverty. Almost 1 in 10 Europeans is unable to keep their home adequately warm. On top of that, housing affordability is an increasing challenge in the Union in almost all Member States. In 2022, almost 1 in 10 persons lived in a household where total housing costs represented more than 40% of their income, with a significant increase since 2020. Obviously, although housing is not directly an EU competence, there is a strong demand now, also from Member States, for the EU to take a stronger role in tackling the European-wide housing crisis. We cannot turn a blind eye to the problem of the working poor in the EU. This is why wage policies and the legislation on adequate minimum wages that the EU has adopted and Member States have now to implement are of key importance. It’s also about part-time work imposed especially on single parents — and when I say single parents, I mean, in most cases, single mothers — that cannot rely on affordable childcare and therefore cannot have a full-time job and decent pay. We have seen how statutory minimum wage policies have been successful in protecting the purchasing power of workers with lower incomes in many Member States, and that’s why the implementation of the Directive on Adequate Minimum Wages is key. By the way, there are a lot of good examples that increasing minimum wages quite strongly does not destroy jobs. We see that in the European Union now that those countries who have done that, they have even seen their unemployment rate reduce quite dramatically. Real wages significantly dropped in 2022 and to a lesser extent in 2023. Furthermore, upward wage convergence has been stalling. While in 2024 real wages are expected to somewhat rebound, they would remain well below pre-pandemic levels for most countries. And in this context, it is crucial that euro area countries support wage developments that mitigate purchasing power losses, especially for low-income earners. Furthermore, it is essential that Member States promote collective bargaining on wage setting and ensure an effective involvement of social partners. We frequently forget that wages represent a very important part of our internal demand. And precisely this internal demand in the EU has remained rather sluggish in recent years. This also explains why our growth is now quite low. Given the repeated shocks and crises, effective policies and exceptional social transfers have helped prevent a major worsening: job protection during the pandemic, namely through the SURE instrument, resilience of employment, as well as increases in statutory minimum wages and income support measures have helped mitigate the negative social impact of the pandemic, high energy prices and inflation. But no significant progress in reducing poverty and inequalities has been achieved, notwithstanding a recent high employment rate. This is why we need to step up our efforts towards our target of reducing, by 2030, the number of persons at risk of poverty or social exclusion in the EU by at least 15 million, including at least 5 million children. To sustain these efforts, this needs to be complemented by reaching the targets on employment and particularly skills. Technological change creates skills shortages. Companies are complaining about these skills shortages. That is why it is absolutely important and urgent to invest more in human capital and, finally, to give everybody an equal opportunity precisely to get the right skills and the right educational level. We should also further tackle inequalities, not only to ensure better cohesion within our societies, but also because high inequalities have a negative impact on economic growth. We need holistic approaches that combine social and economic policies as well as fair taxation. Wages are generally much more taxed than other sources of income. We must live up to our commitments. Strong welfare systems and quality jobs are needed to fight poverty and address these new challenges. In line with this, we need to put a larger focus on social investment policies and reforms. This has been the spirit of the RF and will also be the spirit of the fiscal structural plans under the revised economic governance framework, as also discussed during Tuesday’s Ecofin Joint Council Meeting. Social investments and reforms, complemented by well-functioning social protection systems, thus have an important role in mitigating social risks and promoting upward social convergence. Tackling poverty and social exclusion is at the centre of the European Pillar of Social Rights and its action plan. I just mentioned the European Child Guarantee, the Directive on Adequate Minimum Wages, the Council recommendation on adequate minimum income, the European Platform on Combatting Homelessness, and so on. These need to be fully implemented now. We also support Member States by providing guidance through the European Semester and with EU funding, especially the ESF which, for example, invests EUR 45.5 billion in social inclusion. The actions we have put in place have set in motion our joint undertaking to make Europe fairer and more inclusive, but we need to be consistent in the implementation and do more to ensure our social cohesion. Social cohesion is essential. Social cohesion is essential also for competitiveness, to strengthen Europe, to make it stronger in a dangerous geopolitical context. We have to have strong solidarity between European Member States as well as inside our Member States. We should leave nobody behind. This is also about jobs, but not just any jobs: good-quality jobs with high productivity, with fair wages and good working conditions. We share a common goal that precariousness, poverty and social exclusion should be eradicated in Europe. And that is, finally, the objective of our social market economy system.",-,2024-03-14,6.

Liudas Mažylis,"Madam President, Commissioner, colleagues, robbing cultural historical treasures is a very usual behaviour of Russia since Tsarist times. For instance, exhibits from Lithuanian museums were taken out to Russia in the middle of the 19th century and are still not returned. Important historical documents are robbed by Russia too and are secretly kept without possibility to even be acquainted with them. Exactly the same was done by Bolsheviks with Romanian national treasure, including almost 100 tonnes of gold. Totalitarian regimes in Russia change, but the will to return treasures to their owners does not appear. Now the same continues on the Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia. The task of the occupants is far from only getting financial value. They also seek to humiliate neighbouring countries and to break down their national identity. Russia refuses to follow corresponding UNESCO and other conventions. Anyway, at least one precedent is already created.

Elisa Ferreira,"Mr President, I’ll be speaking here on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Stella Kyriakides. In 2020, the Commission announced that, by 2023, it would revise the European Union’s animal welfare rules and consider options for animal welfare labelling. As part of this revision, we announced, in 2021, the intention to propose rules to phase out and eventually prohibit the use of cages in animal farming. This was in response to the European Citizens Initiative ‘End the Cage Age’. By now, the Commission has established a vast range of policy options for these future rules. These options are supported by the fitness check of the current rules, several external studies, and 11 scientific opinions delivered by the European Food Safety Authority. And in 2021, we began a thorough impact assessment of their economic, social and environmental impacts. This is still going on. As you know, on 7 December 2023, the Commission adopted two major animal welfare legislative proposals. The first one is a revised regulation (after two decades) on the protection of animals during transport. The second one is a new regulation dealing, for the first time, with the welfare and traceability of dogs and cats. The work on proposals to revise European Union rules on the welfare of animals at farm level at the time of killing and on establishing harmonised rules for animal welfare labelling is still ongoing. Work is also still ongoing in relation to the follow-up to our response to the ‘End the Cage Age’ initiative, where we are carefully assessing important aspects to ensure that the transition to cage-free farming is also sustainable for the agricultural sector and for our food systems, in order for the said proposals to be holistic and solid. More consultations are also needed on the costs, on how long the transition periods should be, and relevant measures at import. The strategic dialogue on the future of EU agriculture started on 25 January 2024. It should be a good place for these discussions. We are all aware that farmers are looking for a level playing field. Some of them are not satisfied with the scattered landscape we have on animal welfare standards across the European Union. They have to consider many different and constantly changing national requirements and private schemes for animal welfare. It is therefore our responsibility to provide them with long-term stability and clarity about what will be considered acceptable when it comes to animal welfare. Of course, reforming animal welfare implies costs. We have to take them into account and identify solutions. But reducing the fragmentation of the internal market would allow farmers to invest in their farms and profit from the market opportunities that come with animal welfare improvements. For all these reasons, we are continuing to look at the best course of action in these areas, keeping in mind stakeholders’ views and of course, the views of the European Parliament.",-,2024-03-14,4.

Elisa Ferreira,"Madam President, on this topic, I’ll be speaking on behalf of the High Representative / Vice-President, Josep Borrell, who is at the moment at the United Nations. Honourable Members of the European Parliament, you have invited the Commission to speak on the return of the national treasure of Romania. Romania’s national treasure was transferred to the tsarist Russian Empire during the First World War for protection but was never returned in its entirety to Romania, neither by the USSR nor by the Russian Federation. This remained a recurrent topic on the agenda of the Romanian-Soviet and then Romanian-Russian bilateral discussions. The treasure includes the National Bank of Romania’s gold reserves, Queen Mary’s jewels, archives and other historical and cultural valuables, and exposes yet another violation of international law by Russia. While the topic continues to be a bilateral issue between Romania and Russia, the European Union stands ready to support the Romanian authorities’ efforts to obtain the full restitution of its national treasure, if they so request. This will be a long-term endeavour, as currently there is not a sufficient level of trust between the European Union and Russia to suggest that we could get any meaningful outcome from Russia. As a consequence of the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and Russia’s illegal, unprovoked and unjustified full-scale war of aggression against Ukraine since 2022, the policy dialogues and the mechanism of cooperation between the European Union and Russia have been suspended. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine marked a fundamental turning point in relations between the European Union and Russia. As long as Russia’s illegal war against Ukraine continues, we’ll continue calling it out for war crimes and for blatant violations of international humanitarian law. We will maintain our political, military, economic and humanitarian support for Ukraine and will continue applying restrictive measures against Russia, which already include the largest sanctions packages in our union’s history. At the same time, we continue to support Russian civil society, human rights defenders and independent media who speak out against the regime.",-,2024-03-14,5.

Elisa Ferreira,"Mr President, honourable Members, I am speaking here on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Helena Dalli. In fact, lack of access to safe and legal abortion can affect several fundamental rights, including human dignity and the right to equality and to the physical and mental integrity of the person. The European Court of Human Rights has recognised the lack of access to abortion services as a violation of the right to family and private life. When it comes to competence on that matter, Article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides that health care, including sexual and reproductive health care, falls within the Member States’ competence. Member States are thus responsible for the definition of their health priorities and the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care. The Union’s competence is limited to encouraging cooperation between Member States and, if necessary, lending support to direction. However, when making use of their competences, Member States must respect the rights enshrined in their national constitutions and comply with their commitments under international law. The Commission considers that everyone across the European Union should have adequate access to quality health care and treatment, and that sexual and reproductive health rights are at the core of gender equality. The Commission therefore supports regular exchanges between Member States and stakeholders on these matters under the Mutual Learning Programme in Gender Equality. The Commission also continues to fund civil society organisations working on gender equality, including sexual and reproductive health and rights through the Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values programme. Furthermore, it provides support to Member States’ efforts in implementing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals relevant to women’s health, universal access to sexual and reproductive care, family planning, and education. Regarding the inclusion of the right to abortion in the Charter, Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union confirms that the rights, freedoms and principles set out in the Charter have the same legal value as the Treaties. An amendment of the Charter would accordingly follow the procedure to revise the Treaties set out in Article 48 of the TEU. A revision of the Charter requires a common accord of the conference of representatives of the governments of all Member States. The revision would then be subject to approval in each Member State in accordance with national constitutional requirements. The Commission is determined to do everything within the remits of its competence to advance fundamental rights. Thank you very much for your discussions and attention.",-,2024-03-14,3.

Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield,"Mr President, it is time for feminists, for progressives and for citizens to ask for what is needed. And in 2024, enshrining sexual and reproductive rights in the heart of our European text is a necessity for the well-being of people and specifically the safety of women. There is no healthy democracy without women’s rights and gender equality. Last November, this Parliament voted to have the inclusion of these rights in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and it is good to reaffirm it today. But why be less ambitious? We have to reclaim the entirety of our rights and to counter the narrative of the far right and those who want to make us live in fear. Bodily autonomy comes with contraception. Bodily autonomy comes with sexual education. The health of women can no longer be less of a priority for academics and doctors. Ignorance has always been a poison used to control a population. Of course we need abortion. Abortion gives women the power to choose their own lives. This is not a discussion. There are still too many women at risk of dying, or having to flee their country to find a solution, or seeing their life dramatically impacted by an unwanted pregnancy in the European Union. Yes! But this is a societal and democratic issue, not a woman’s problem. All people, no matter what their sex and gender, should know their body. So this is how to protect it. How to heal it.

Marc Angel,"Madam President, dear Commissioner, dear colleagues, for many years, European citizens have been asking for a revision of the EU animal welfare legislation. Some 84% of Europeans believe that the welfare of farmed animals should be better protected, and 90% consider that farming and breeding practices should meet basic ethical requirements. And at the same time, millions of signatures have been collected for the Citizens’ Initiatives ‘End the cage age’ and ‘Fur-free Europe’. And the message that these citizens are sending us is very clear: the current EU animal welfare situation must change, and it is regrettable that the Commission has failed to implement such important instruments of participatory democracy, and that it has given priority to business interests. The way we treat animals mirrors the kind of humans we are. Animal welfare is essential for a civilised, healthy and sustainable society, and the European Union needs to push for the highest possible standards. Time is running out. It is time for the Commission to deliver on their promises.

But equally, we also have to accept that Ireland, specifically, is an island nation and to have access to the single internal market, it does have to transport animals off the island, so we need to ensure that the transporters are of the highest quality, in terms of ventilation, temperature, lifetime, satellite tracking, veterinary oversight, feeding systems in place and ensuring that there is quality.

So putting time limits, arbitrary time limits, especially for countries like Portugal and Ireland, makes absolutely no sense.

Europe needs a robust system that meets the expectations of society, including animal welfare concerns, which is not fully the case today. At the same time, we have to give farmers the predictability and stability they need for their animal welfare investments in order for our animal welfare endeavours to be successful. Any new rule that has to come with tailored transition periods and appropriate supporting policies, including financial support.

Recently there was a manifestation in Brussels calling for a ceasefire. But I heard nobody talk about the atrocities committed by Hamas, and that view is becoming more and more mainstream in our media. We must not forget what ignited this horrible situation for ordinary Palestinians. The Hamas assault on Israel, in which it killed, raped and tortured over a thousand men, women and children and took at least 240 people to Gaza as hostages. Calling just for a ceasefire is, to a certain degree, saying to Hamas, ‘Well, you can try it again tomorrow.’ Dear colleagues, I am strongly convinced that there will be no prospects for peace, security, stability and prosperity for Gaza, as well as for Palestinian-Israeli reconciliation, as long as Hamas and other terrorist groups will play any role in the Gaza Strip. I support the continuation of humanitarian aid entering Gaza by road, air and sea, and stressed that it must reach those civilians in need, not Hamas, not UNWRA. The disbursement of aid has to be organised in such a way that chaotic scenes and Hamas taking over aid convoys and redirecting aid to its own fighters are prevented. EU funds, which in the past were provided to UNWRA, should in the future be given to the UN Development Programme, UN Refugee Agency and the World Food Programme.

Gripped by a long-overdue crisis of conscience, the US and the EU make great play of airdrops, maritime corridors and calls for Israel to open new humanitarian routes. What is the logic here?

Andrey Novakov,"Madam President, dear colleagues, dear Commissioner, somehow I’m attracted to history by reading a lot about the Roman Empire, and I know that before they establish a village or a city, first they build a road, and I think they have very good reasons to do so. This helps me understand why, when we build an airport or a highway to a given place in Europe, we are not just absorbing EU funds, we are not just using EU programmes: we are keeping a whole region alive. If you visit an average small or medium city somewhere in Europe and ask the average citizen there what Europe can do for you, I bet my hat that most of them will reply, ‘Help me bring more EU funds to my place. We would like to attract more tourists. We need research and development facilities or centres. We would like to see a new factory improved here with EU funds. We would like to have safer and cleaner modes of transport thanks to EU funds.’ Nobody will ask about any other dimension of the Union, and yes, of course, our Union is probably the greatest achievement of humankind because of this almost a century of peace.

And this is Hamas, Hamas, Hamas, and additionally, the Iranian regime triggering all of this, and global Islamist terrorism generally. We have to say the truth this time for different reasons. First, Hamas is responsible because it has not undertaken only many, many attacks against its neighbour state – which is not a neighbour state since Hamas is not representing a state – against its neighbour, Israel. But also this incredible terrorist attack, the largest of all times, on 7 October last year. And Hamas is stealing goods, food, aid, stealing it every day for its own purposes, and to put it on the market, not even to put the rest of it to starving people, but to put it on a so-called market. Hamas is responsible, and we have to tell the truth, because otherwise, after this war, we will again have conspiracy theories against Israel, we will again have antisemitism, and we will again have terrorism. The same terrorism that’s threatening us in our cities, in our rural areas, in our urban areas within Europe, threatening Europeans. It’s the same terrorism, Israel is fighting against; it’s also threatening us. So, I can only claim time and again, what we need is demilitarisation of all Palestinian territories. What we need is the creation of a civil society of education, of fighting antisemitism, of economic self-responsibility; not that money must be poured in from all the world all the time, for decades, in that region. Then, maybe one day, a two-state solution can appear if there is a security guarantee for Israel. So let’s blame Hamas, and let’s help the suffering people.

Monika Hohlmeier,"Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, at the beginning, I would like to thank all my colleagues first; Nils Ušakovs is my colleague who has worked together with me as Co-rapporteur excellently, thank you very much, and all the shadow rapporteurs. The Financial Regulation is a single rulebook for budget implementation and can be considered one of the backbones of the EU budget. The recast of the Financial Regulation was necessary to provide more flexibility, offer simplified cost options, reduce administrative burden for small and medium-sized companies and grant applicants, and build on the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic. We also saw that there is a strong need to increase transparency about beneficiaries, and lay down the foundation for an IT system that allows the tracking and tracing of EU funds appropriate for the 21st century. It also was the time to expand the level of protection to shared management, making sure that criminals and fraudsters cannot easily apply in one Member State and then try it in another one. The negotiations were not easy at times, and may I say thank you very much to the Commissioner and to General Director Stéphanie Riso who supported strongly the Parliament and the negotiation team to get to finalise the talks. Let me go a bit into the detail of what we have achieved. First, it is the interoperable IT system. The first step is the mandatory data feeding of ARACHNE in an interoperable IT system for targeted data search, tracking of funds and risk assessment for programmes. The use of the system remains voluntary; however, many Member States are already using the system, so in a few years they will provide the required data for the practical reasons. The administrative burden on Member States’ authorities will decrease a lot, bringing transparency up and allowing the Commission to effectively track beneficiaries. Simplification was a second goal, introducing a very low value grant up to EUR 15 000 with simplified documentation, and reducing significantly documentation for small grant requests. We are asking the Commission to implement it quickly. Then the EDES system, a targeted extension of the EDES system to shared management as of 1 January 2028. It was astonishing that the Member States were so reluctant to support this idea. Secondly, the next point was increased transparency in Article 38 by expanding the financial transparency system, explicitly stating the respect of the values of the EU Charter Article 2 in the horizontal principles, in Article 6 when implementing the EU budget. While this should be an obvious point, it has been missing from the Financial Regulation. Then, the last point – recital on ‘gold plating’ – we have so much bureaucracy created by Member States because they are overregulating and their over-bureaucratisation. On a final note, I want to stress that some of these changes will only apply from the new MFF onwards. But it is really a good step in the right direction. Thank you again to the Commissioner and Stéphanie Riso for the support and for the really qualitative, very good work.",PPE,2024-03-13,18.

Elisa Ferreira,"Madam President, dear Chair, cher ami Younous Omarjee, dear Andrey Novakov, dear honourable Members of this Parliament, I want to thank you for your engagement throughout the mandate. I think we wouldn’t have a better way to close a session if we didn’t have such an interesting report that, as you mentioned, Mr Omarjee, was agreed with unanimity by all the members of this important committee, the REGI Committee. I took note of everything that you said and I would like just to make a couple of comments. The first one is, in fact, to thank you and also to note the diversity of cases that you are bringing forward. Good examples but also difficult problems to be addressed. You mentioned border areas, you mentioned rural areas, you mentioned the outermost regions, mountainous areas. I think the most important conclusion that we have to make is, in fact, that this is a policy that has to be built bottom-up and reflecting and fine-tuned to the diversity of situations we have to face. So, the character of a place-based policy that involves the agents on the ground, the stakeholders, the trade unions, the mayors, the civil society; everybody has got to participate because the quality of the vision for the region determines the success of the policy. A second aspect I would like to underline is that it is not only for cohesion policy to promote cohesion. It is important that the value that cohesion brings from a political and from an economic angle is shared by the Member State and by all the actors on the ground, including the regions that have the internal imbalances that some of you have mentioned. The purpose of the cohesion policy is not to keep financing the regions forever, it is to give the support that is used in such a way that the region can participate in the internal market without, in the future, ideally receiving any support. It is the capacity to grow by itself that has got to be stimulated and not a permanent transfer of funding. From this perspective, I would like to underline something that was also said here, that is when a region grows, it enlarges the internal market. It gives opportunities for investment – private investment, public investment – and selling for all the countries in Europe. When you look at the regions and countries that joined the European Union after 2004 enlargement, they had a GDP per capita of 52 % of the average. Now they have 80 %. This means a lot of people wanting to buy products, a lot of opportunities for investments, a lot of new jobs that can be created. It is with the quality of the analysis and proposals that we can change the disparities inside Europe. This is the work that has got to be shared by all Member States and taken into account in the horizontal policies. All policies have asymmetric impacts on the different regions. So, I urge you to continue this debate, including the presentation of the 9th Cohesion Forum. I would like you to be present in the meeting that we have foreseen for 11 and 12 April, and I think for the future, when we are thinking of enlargement and all the things that are changing – greening, digital and unexpected events – we need a strong cohesion policy to make all these challenges an advantage. I encourage you to share your reflections, to share your discussions, but also to come forward, to come outside the group of people that know the policy and to share with citizens in general and with other actors – ministers in your country, prime ministers and other colleagues – how important it is for Europe to progress, to develop, to have an even stronger cohesion policy. Thank you very, very much for all your work.",-,2024-03-13,19.

Elisa Ferreira,"Madam President, dear rapporteur Andrey Novakov, honourable Members, first of all, thank you very much for this report. I find this report extremely timely and appropriate because in fact, on one hand, it provides evidence that cohesion policy works and demonstrates the value of a place-based policy. My particular thanks to the rapporteur for highlighting the results of cohesion programming during the period that is now finishing. The report also identifies the challenges ahead, in particular demographic change, climate change and continued geopolitical instability, as well as areas of improvement and modernisation of the policy to be able to respond, to give the adequate answer to these challenges. So, I think this report makes a vital contribution to discussions on the future of the policy. Indeed, your report, I would like to underline four elements in this report, in relation in particular to the role that we all have to address of modernising cohesion policy. First, enhancing the performance of the policy and a related second area that touches directly simplification and the ease of implementation, which by itself requires improved administrative capacity so that you can have another mode of managing the policy. We see potential to increase effectiveness at the same time as accelerating implementation and you build on lessons learned from other European instruments, such as the Recovery and Resilience Facility funds and plans. But of course, there are certain elements that we cannot disregard or change in cohesion policy and this is the identity, main principles, long-term objectives of the policy – and they have got to be preserved. A third aspect: enhanced links with reforms, better governance, administrative capacity need, in fact, to be seriously considered. As the report points out, some Member States’ regional and local authorities, as well as other stakeholders, lack sufficient capacity to design, plan, implement, and this capacity is a precondition for performance-based programme management. Moreover, to maximise impacts, investments must in fact be combined with reforms. Reflections should cover the scope of the reforms needed, the role of the European Semester and how Member States can play their part, their role. A fourth element: we are considering increased flexibility for emerging challenges. Different challenges affect each region differently and cohesion policy intervention during recent crises has been indispensable. Otherwise, there would have been the collapse of a lot of regions and countries. From the emergency response to COVID-19, to the STEP initiative, we have shown that Europe is close to the citizens, is in a solidarity mode with the citizens also in times of crisis, or in particular in times of crisis, while promoting European competitiveness in a fast-changing world. As you know, together with you, all of you, we have done our utmost with the policies’ long-term objectives not being shifted or changed to balance the policy and to adjust the policy to give adequate responses to this crisis. We continue to support long-term investments. It’s are the key drivers of economic convergence, get regions out of development traps, make sure that in fact and in reality, no person is forgotten or feels forgotten. In the coming weeks, the Commission will publish the Ninth Cohesion Report. This will raise key questions for the future, providing solid data, solid information, which is also an important basis for discussion. So, your contribution is absolutely essential. Thank you very much for it and I look forward to the exchange that will follow.",-,2024-03-13,19.

Nils Ušakovs,"Madam President, we have made significant efforts towards the revision of the Financial Regulation and achieved decent results in our fight to make the spending of European money more transparent, honest and effective. Still, we will be facing a number of challenges ahead. The Financial Regulation needs further improvement, as well as the way European money is spent. A main concern in the future will still be the inability to absorb available resources, inability to select suitable projects, and inability to implement sophisticated large-scale projects. 75% of funds are managed under shared management, and we all know that the ways national authorities select projects and ensure their adequacy differ from country to country. In Latvia, on one hand, they are concerned that a significant part of EU funds – up to EUR 500 million may just go unspent. This is a failure of the Latvian Government and the respective Ministries, and this also means huge missed opportunities for Latvian people. On the other hand, we have examples like Rail Baltica, a high-speed rail project connecting European countries in the Baltic region, the largest European project ever in the Baltic region, worth billions of euro. And we still don’t know precisely how many billions that will cost at the end of the day. And here we see another failure of the Latvian authorities that may result in another type of risks: the new railroad skipping Riga, the largest and central city in the region. At the same time, there are numerous examples of infrastructure projects related to construction and innovation, and renovation in the middle of nowhere, having zero or minimal effect. Parliament has undertaken considerable effort to improve the way European money is spent. Much more will have to be done in the forthcoming mandates of the European Parliament.",S&D,2024-03-13,18.

Johannes Hahn,"Frau Vorsitzende, honourable Members, once again, a big thank you for all your efforts and contribution in reaching this final agreement. We would have not made it to the finish line without Parliament’s strong support, flexibility and cooperation, and willingness, I have to say, to compromise. I would like to extend my thanks to everyone involved in the process, who made reaching the agreement possible. I truly believe that we were able to find excellent compromises that many EU citizens, beneficiaries and implementing partners will be able to benefit from. We had a common goal, which we were able to reach. The Union budget will be more agile for times of crisis, more transparent and better protected against fraudsters. I must also mention that the Commission has made a formal statement in relation to the data mining and risk scoring tool, and the publication of data on recipients of EU funds. This statement will be sent to Parliament’s services for inclusion in the verbatim record of this debate. Once again, thank you, and let us not do this again any time too soon, please! But if necessary, it has to be done.

Mick Wallace,"Madam President, with this semester document, the EU has missed a golden opportunity to reform its own fiscal rules. The deal, struck in December 2023, maintains the Maastricht Treaty’s 60 % debt and 3 % deficit ceilings, and this, I think, is a mistake. Take, for example, how the current fiscal rules work in Belgium. To comply with the current rules, the Belgian Government will have to save EUR 4 billion a year for seven years, or EUR 7 billion a year for four years. This means a total of EUR 28 billion will be removed from the public spending powers and taken out of the Belgian economy up to the end of the decade. This amounts to an attack on democracy and a hollowing out of the welfare state. It’s madness that the fiscal rules imposed by the Maastricht Treaty are essentially undermining public spending still. While we encourage Member States to spend more and more on defence, we allowed the fiscal rules to reduce state support for citizens that most need them.

Katalin Cseh,"Madam President, dear colleagues, as we stepped into this Parliament in 2019, the EU’s anti-fraud framework seemed like a water pistol against the forest fire, designed to address small irregularities but simply inadequate in the face of systemic corruption, like what we witnessed in Hungary. Many claimed it was impossible to change anything, but we rolled up our sleeves and got to work – and we did make breakthroughs. Creating the rule of law mechanism stands out as a crucial reform. It shows that the EU is finally taking up a fight, and this financial regulation also improves things in the right direction. We’ve boosted transparency by improving our database of final beneficiaries, and we reinforced the EU’s blacklist, which shockingly did not cover funds jointly managed by Member States – and now it does. But of course there is more work ahead. Take the blacklist, for instance. It remains still too narrow in scope and too slow. It should automatically include applicants where the EU’s investigations unveil fraud – and colleagues, this is the fight we are going to have in the next mandate.

Johannes Hahn,"Mr President, rapporteurs and honourable Members, first of all, I would like to thank you on your great cooperation and flexibility for reaching political agreement on the revision of the Financial Regulation. It was really a team effort, and we should be proud of what we have achieved. It was not always an easy road, but in the end we reached this goal together and it was set by the two rapporteurs. In that particular so-called trilogue there was an unusually close cooperation between Parliament and the Commission to convince very often the Council on what is necessary, what is possible, what is feasible and what is finally necessary in order to make things happen and to improve also the situation when it comes to financial matters. Therefore, I think we should take a moment to look at the major advances that were agreed. The Commission proposal contains several hundred changes to the Financial Regulation and finally we managed indeed to find common ground on most of them. The final text contains very important improvements for EU citizens, beneficiaries and partners of the Union budget. We will better protect the Union budget because one of the biggest achievements, and it was already mentioned by Monika Hohlmeier, has been reached due to the extension of the early-detection and exclusion system – the famous EDES – to shared management starting from 1 January 2028. This date is definitely a compromise. It is not the date we wanted to have, but we have to accept it. The 70 % of the Union budget not covered by this protection tool today will also be protected from going to beneficiaries convicted for fraud, corruption and other serious misconducts. We closed a very important loophole of the old system. Another very important achievement is the compulsory feeding of the data-mining and risk-scoring tool for audit and control purposes as from 1 January 2028. The improved data-mining tool significantly reinforces the protection of the Union budget. However, let us not forget the next step for taking this protection to an even higher level to also make the use of the improved tool compulsory in the next MFF. We will have more transparency for the public on who gets Union funding, because our improved financial transparency system means that information on beneficiaries of Union funding will no longer be fragmented over different websites, but concentrated in a single place. This ensures that citizens will be able to easily find information on the use of the Union budget. There will be less administrative burden for beneficiaries of Union funding and implementing partners. We achieved a lot of simplifications for grants and direct management. One such achievement is the introduction of a new category of very low value grants, following the Parliament’s request. We will have clear rules for handling financing in crisis situation. Public procurement rules in cases of crisis will allow us to react more quickly, including on behalf of Member States, and rules to avoid professional conflicting interests make our procurements more credible. We have also replied to many of this Parliament’s requests. For instance, the financial regulation will include a clear reference to respect EU values and new definition of non-governmental organisations is added. And we also agreed to include new references to gender and social rights in the context of programme performance. There are many other important achievements, such as the agreement for deducting from competition fines that are confirmed the compensation to companies seeing a competition fine annulled by the European courts. We also have a clear legal framework for Union participation in global initiatives in areas such as health, climate and education. So once again, my services are already working to ensure that everything will be ready once the recast will enter into force. And on this particular file, again, I would like to thank the Parliament for its extremely dedicated cooperation in this issue and the things we have achieved finally together.

Nils Ušakovs,"Mr President, dear Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since the beginning of this parliamentary mandate, we have been preparing the work on this file and eagerly awaited this moment to finally adopt a revised Financial Regulation. Let me be clear: this revision was long overdue. It is remarkable that it took so much time. Parliament was united and ready from the very beginning. The multiannual financial framework is in place. We see substantial increase in funds, Corona reconstruction funds, NextGenerationEU. That is why our vision on what is needed to be done was so clear: transparency spending such large sums of money. However, despite our clear commitment, we have encountered hesitation from Member States, it seems, when it comes to strengthening the control of these enormous funds, expanding special control systems like the early-detection and exclusion system to be fully applicable to all funds without exception. Member States are reluctant both to empower the Parliament to fulfil its role as budgetary and budgetary control authority, and to trust the Commission, who is in charge of the implementation of the programmes. This needs improvement, and I can assure you that Parliament will keep insisting on being granted a role in structuring the EU budget, but also for obtaining full control over how funds are allocated. Despite several points of contention with the Council, we could significantly advance in this legislation. One such achievement is emphasis on decent working conditions and the protection of workers’ rights. Social standards in the Financial Regulation are a novelty and a monumental step forward. Now any entities seeking funding from EU programmes must uphold the right to decent working conditions in accordance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. To put it simple, businesses that fail to respect workers’ social rights will not receive any money from Europe. You pay wages in envelopes. No EU money. We do not tolerate grey economies at the expense of taxpayers and their welfare, and we refuse to support shameful labour practices with European taxpayers money. This is a new general standard applicable to all European funds and not just specific programmes. There are millions of working people across our Union earning hard their money, and protecting their rights should be equally important as environmental or economic goals. Another significant step forward in strengthening our financial framework was to ensure alignment with the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation. By aligning with the Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation and emphasising the importance of respecting Union values and fundamental rights, we are reinforcing our commitment to accountability, transparency and the rule of law. We aim for a legislation that is uniform and loophole-free to maintain the trust of our citizens in a democratic European Union. Through the revised Financial Regulation, we send a clear message: whoever fails to comply with rule of law conditionality will face consequences. We do not give money to those who do not respect our values and fundamental rights. I would like to close this address with gratitude to my co-rapporteur Monika Hohlmeier. It was really fantastic experience. I would like to thank Commissioner Hahn for the work you’ve done as an honest broker, getting us with the Council and Member States and getting this revision done. And, of course, thanks to your fantastic team and to the director. I would like also to express gratitude to the Spanish Presidency, which is not right now in the plenary, but we managed to do this.",S&D,2024-03-13,18.

Elisa Ferreira,"Mr President, I’m speaking here on behalf of the High Representative / Vice-President, Josep Borrell, who is on mission to the United Nations. We are in the fifth month of this terrible war between Israel and Hamas, which has taken tens of thousands of lives and brought so much destruction across Gaza. The tragic events that we continue to see every day critically remind us about the absolute urgency to end the fighting, massively increase humanitarian aid and free the remaining hostages. The European Union has fully supported the negotiations for another humanitarian pause, leading to a sustainable ceasefire and release of hostages. The European Union has repeatedly stressed the right of Israel to defend its citizens in the face of the horrible and indiscriminate terrorist attack of 7 October. These rights must be exercised in line with international humanitarian and human rights law. This means that the protection of civilians must remain a priority. We have witnessed horrific images, such as those of 29 February in the northern part of Gaza, where over 100 Palestinians were killed while trying to access humanitarian aid deliveries. Another 700 people were injured. People in Gaza are starving. The health system is in a state of collapse. We are very concerned about the humanitarian consequences of a possible ground operation in Rafah. The international community needs to take action to protect civilians from both starvation and violence. All those concerned about the situation in Gaza should put pressure on the Israeli Government to grant unimpeded humanitarian land access without blocking convoys. Other options are not enough. Airdrops are good, but insufficient. Sea corridors are needed, but take time. And time is of the essence. The European Union will continue supporting the United Nations and other humanitarian actors, sparing no effort to contribute to alleviating the humanitarian disaster for the Palestinian population. In addition to the EUR 125 million for humanitarian assistance in 2024, the European Union recently agreed an additional EUR 68 million to support the Palestinian people across the region. We will work with key partners, such as the Red Cross and the Red Crescent. We will also continue to support UNRWA in its central role in Gaza and elsewhere in the region. And we have just paid the first EUR 50 million of the 2024 envelope.

The repression continues, as we have seen over the weekend with the arrest of yet another of Machado’s party members, this time in the region of Barinas. Today we are discussing the cases of Rocío San Miguel and General Hernández Da Costa. Let me start by recalling that the European Union has been firmly and actively committed to promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the protection of human rights defenders in Venezuela and the protection of European Union citizens in the country. Rocío San Miguel is one of them: a Spanish Venezuelan citizen. She is the president of the NGO Control Ciudadano and a renowned human rights defender who has been imprisoned since 9 February without access to her lawyers. She is currently detained in the headquarters of Venezuela’s intelligence service, known as ‘El Helicoide’. Four other relatives, including three Spanish-Venezuelan citizens who were arrested with her, have been released on condition not to leave the country or speak to the media. Regarding General Héctor Hernández Da Costa, he has been detained since 2018. His family and lawyers have in vain requested to obtain access and to provide the necessary medical assistance. Honourable Members, the European Union continues to call on the Venezuelan authorities to guarantee political and civil rights, and ensure the protection of human rights defenders. We will continue to monitor closely the situation, including by promoting access to human rights mechanisms in Venezuela. The European Union deeply regrets the decision of the Venezuelan authorities to suspend the activities of the technical office of the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights. The European Union commends the significant work of the office in Venezuela, engaging with the authorities, political actors and civil society, and calls for its prompt reopening and resumption of activities. The European Union calls for the immediate and unconditional release of those individuals unjustly detained, for respect of due process, for the protection and safety of detainees to be ensured at all times, and for them to be allowed immediate access to their lawyers of choice and family visits. The European Union remains convinced that the repression of human rights and political freedoms needs to be addressed through a peaceful and democratic solution to the political crisis, including inclusive and competitive elections. We hope that the forthcoming presidential elections to be held on 28 July will reflect the democratic aspirations of the Venezuelans. The European Union will continue working with Venezuelans and the international community to foster dialogue and to foster democracy, and to promote the respect of the rule of law and human rights in Venezuela.",-,2024-03-13,"20.3.

Elisa Ferreira,"Mr President, I’ve been listening carefully to what you have been saying, but the Commission would like to underline that it has already taken the necessary steps in order to address most of the recommendations in the European Ombudsman’s special report. The Commission regularly revises existing administrative practices and is developing new IT tools in order to adapt to the reality of the 21st century, also taking into account the relevant case-law of the European Union courts. While the Commission notes that certain delays occur at the confirmatory stage due to the increasing number, complexity and sensitivity of the requests, it would like to reiterate that the overall numbers indeed confirm the timely handling and high standards of the Commission’s implementation of Regulation 1049/2001. While Regulation 1049/2001 on public access to documents remains the legal instrument for the handling of applications for access to documents, I would like to reiterate that two legislative proposals to recast this regulation have been pending for quite a long time. The Commission does not see, for the moment, the willingness from co-legislators to engage in a revision process, but it stands ready to support further legislative and political discussions.

Cyrus Engerer,"Mr President, I’ve taken transparency quite strongly here since I’ve been a Member of this House and I must say, I’m very disappointed in the failure of the Commission to provide timely access to documents. Everything is delayed, everything is late, sometimes they don’t even arrive these documents. This transparency is very crucial for public scrutiny and it is very crucial also for trust that our citizens must have in our European institutions. But it is not only the Commission. I must urge also governments in the different Member States to take transparency seriously. It is unacceptable to have journalists being denied freedom of information requests and then needing to go in front of the courts to get public documents that should be everyone’s. I would like to highlight the wonderful job of the European Ombudsman O’Reilly for keeping the pressure on the Commission and for providing us with figures, but also for the introduction of a fast-track procedure by the Ombudsman to deal with so many complaints in this field. It is crucial for citizens, but also for journalists to be provided quickly those accesses and this is important for the well-functioning of our democracy. So Commission, Member State governments, delaying so much public access to documents is not only unacceptable, we need to make sure that transparency...

EIOPA eventually sent me a heavily redacted version, citing commercially sensitive information as a doubtful reason. Why did EIOPA really withhold information? Might it be the fact that Superbet, the company standing to profit from the liquidation of Romania’s last motor insurer, is chaired by the Commission President’s own brother? The Euroins Romania case is a shocking reminder of Weber’s words and of the Commission’s colonisation by private and business interests.

Tineke Strik,"Mr President, Commissioner, this is an election year. How can citizens judge the performance of Commissioners in charge if their right to access to information is denied? Unjustified secrecy hampers to address corruption, violation of fundamental rights and simply hurts democratic scrutiny of the EU. The Ombudsman’s examples of delayed access to information in its special report relate to issues that are of extremely high public concern: human rights violations at the borders; the spending of billions of euros from the Recovery Fund; COVID vaccines; sanctions against Russia. I want to ask the Commission, are you satisfied with the status quo? Are you alarmed by the Ombudsman’s findings? And most importantly, what are you going to change in order to make substantial progress on transparency in the next five years? Will you commit to: proactive transparency; disclosure of all documents unless there are real justified grounds not to do so; more staff and resources to treat applications; and preventing Commission and agencies from charging legal fees to civil society or journalists trying to access documents in the public interest?

Sophia in 't Veld,"Mr President, Madam Commissioner colleagues, I very much welcome the special report by the European Ombudsman, but it is unfortunate that it had to come to this. I don’t know about you, but I have been here for 20 years now. I’m probably one of the MEPs doing most access to documents requests, and I think never once did I get my documents on time. Never once! If you can find me one instance where I got them on time, I’m going to buy you a drink. But that says everything, apart from all the official figures. The problem here is not just – as the European Ombudsman has flagged up – a lack of capacity, but there is a lack of political will. It is clear that the current Commission is not just disinterested, but actively reluctant to provide more transparency. But without transparency, there is no scrutiny. Without scrutiny, there are no checks on power. Without checks on power, there is no democracy. The Commission will have to do better, and this House will have to do better in holding the Commission to account.

Elisa Ferreira,"Mr President, I’ll be speaking on behalf of Commissioner Vĕra Jourová. And I’ll start by thanking you for the possibility to speak about the time the European Commission takes to deal with requests for public access to documents in accordance with Regulation 1049/2001, in view of the vote on the motion for a resolution submitted by the LIBE Committee at the plenary session. As you know, transparency is one of the objectives of the von der Leyen Commission and underpins any action that the Commission undertakes. With respect to statistics and delays, the Commission provided detailed elements in response to the European Ombudsman’s strategic inquiry on this matter. The Commission indeed receives the highest number of applications for public access to documents among all the institutions. This trend is confirmed in the latest annual report for the year 2022. The number of initial applications received by the Commission in 2022 reached 7 410. As regards confirmatory applications requesting a review by the Commission of the initial replies fully or partially refusing access, their number reached 418 in 2022, which reflects an increase of almost 17.8% in comparison with 2021. The Commission welcomed most of the Ombudsman’s recommendations, which largely correspond to its current practices. The Commission acknowledges the importance of the timely handling of requests for access to documents. It is striving to ensure that requests are processed within statutory deadlines, and notes that most requests for access to documents are handled effectively within the deadlines provided for by Regulation 1049/2001. In this respect, the Commission would like to reiterate that the European Ombudsman’s findings of maladministration concern the confirmatory stage of the access to documents procedure, which represents only a limited part of the total applications received by the Commission: 4% in 2021 and 5% in 2022. Moreover, the statistics confirm the strict interpretation of the exceptions by the Commission, as the requested documents are fully or partially disclosed in more than 77% of cases at the initial stage, and that wider or even full access was granted in more than half of the cases reviewed at the confirmatory stage in 2022. This data not only confirmed the openness of the Commission, but also the commitment of the institution to the right of access to documents as part of its overall transparency policy. In any event, the Commission has taken action in this matter. Firstly, the Commission has reinforced the team in charge of confirmatory applications, which should bring tangible results in the medium term. Secondly, the Commission proactively publishes a wide variety of legal, policy, administrative and other documents on different websites and registers. The Commission has taken additional steps in improving its systems for proactive publication and request handling, such as the updated version of the Register of Commission Documents, which became operational on 17 May 2021. Also, the EASE portal was launched in September 2022 to facilitate public access to documents and interaction with requesters. It is part of the Commission’s effort to improve its systems for proactive publication and request handling, and allows citizens to submit initial and confirmatory applications, see their ongoing and closed requests, receive replies electronically, and search for documents disclosed to other applicants. It additionally constitutes a new case management system, allowing Commission staff to handle the applications for access to documents. Finally, the Commission duly notifies the applicants regarding the available remedies. It is noteworthy that in 2022, the European Ombudsman found instances of maladministration in only two of the 44 inspected cases. In the same vein, in 2022, the General Court handed down 26 judgments or orders in proceedings to which the Commission was a party in relation to decisions concerning access to documents, and it ordered the full or partial annulment in only three cases. This further confirms the high standards of the Commission’s implementation of Regulation 1049/2001, in all circumstances, including in the unprecedented pandemic and geopolitical situation which characterised the past years.",-,2024-03-13,22.

Against this surge of violence and discrimination, the European Union never hesitated to act to combat hatred and to put equality at the centre of all its policies. While we made important steps forward, the ongoing backlash is a reminder that progress towards LGBTIQ equality is fragile and hardly irreversible.

I don’t feel insulted, I’ve got better things to do with my life than making other people miserable. Last month, Greece adopted equal marriage. That is objectively a great step forward. But the real test for Greece is now. In 2018, the Zak Kostopoulos was attacked by a homophobic mob in Athens. He was also beaten by police officers and he died while in police custody, yet the police officers went free. Last week, two trans people were attacked on the streets of Athens by a transphobic mob. This time should be different. The first reactions of the authorities now seem to be more adequate in 2018, so let’s hope it will be better.

Elisa Ferreira,"Mr President, honourable Members, I’ll be speaking on behalf of Commissioner Dalli. Honourable Members, thank you for bringing to the forefront the recent assaults targeting two 21-year-old LGBTIQ people in Thessaloniki. According to local news, a crowd started shouting abuse, proceeded to throw bottles and chased the two individuals, all because of their sexual orientation. My heart goes out to the victims of these abhorrent attacks, as well as to the broader LGBTIQ community. These alarming incidents within our Union pose a direct threat to the very fabric of our societies founded on principles of equality and respect. In recent years, we have witnessed a disturbing rise in hate speech and hate crimes targeting LGBTIQ people as well as organisations advocating for LGBTIQ rights, both globally and within the European Union. According to the latest data, trans and intersex people continue to face disproportionate levels of stigma and violence. The Fundamental Rights Agency’s 2019 LGBTI survey found that one in ten LGBTI respondents in the European Union reported experiencing physical or sexual attacks because of their identity. Trans and intersex respondents faced even higher rates of violence. The European Commission remains steadfast in its commitment to ensuring that you can be who you are, love who you want without fear of discrimination or violence. Four years ago, we took a determined step forward with the adoption of the first ever Commission LGBTIQ Equality Strategy. This comprehensive strategy combines targeted initiatives with the mainstreaming of LGBTIQ equality across all policy domains. Under this strategy, the Commission acted to address fragmentation in the criminalisation of hate speech and to ensure effective protection of all victims of hate speech and hate crimes across the European Union, including LGBTIQ people. In December 2021, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council decision to include hate speech and hate crime in the list of European Union crimes in Article 83 of the Treaty. After more than two years, the Council has not yet reached the needed unanimity to adopt its decision, which is necessary for the Commission to be able to propose a common legal framework to criminalise hate speech and hate crime. I thank the European Parliament for its commitment in support of this initiative. The Commission also called for a swift adoption of the proposal in its joint communication that we called ‘No place for hate’, which represents a strong commitment to reinforce the European Union policy response to hatred in all its forms, including against LGBTIQ individuals. Moreover, the Commission works jointly with the tech industry and other relevant stakeholders to counter hateful content online through the European Union Internet Forum. In 2023, the Forum published a handbook on borderline content to guide tech companies to identify such content, including when targeting LGBTIQ people. The establishment of the High Level Group on combating hate speech and hate crime in 2016 provides a platform for exchange among national authorities and focusing on victim support, law enforcement training and data collection. To face the challenges of online hatred, the Commission initiated a voluntary code of conduct with the major social media platforms. We are in the process of revising the code to ensure it enhances its preventive capacity to respond to threats of hatred before it goes viral. And that the Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values programme, the Commission continues to allocate funding to combat hate crime and aid speech while promoting LGBTIQ equality. One example is our support to a project implemented by the Council of Europe on combating anti-LGBTIQ violence and hate speech, strengthening awareness-raising and fact-based narratives. Equality bodies in the Member States, they have a crucial role in addressing discrimination. That is why we have proposed legislation to establish binding standards for these bodies and strengthen their independence and powers. The new rules will ensure that discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation falls squarely within the mandate of equality bodies in all Member States. We welcome the agreement on this legislation and your support for its swift adoption. Honourable Members, as emphasised by President von der Leyen in her State of the Union address last year, it is the moment to show in reality that we can build a Europe where you can be who you are, love who you want and aim as high as you want.

Elisa Ferreira,"Mr President, like in the previous point, I am speaking on behalf of the High Representative / Vice-President, Josep Borrell, who is at the United Nations on a mission. The European Union is deeply concerned about the deteriorating human rights situation in Afghanistan, in particular the systematic gender-based discrimination and violence by the Taliban against women and girls. In addition to restricting women’s and girls’ freedom of movement and access to employment and education, women are also being arbitrarily arrested and detained for violations of the Taliban-imposed dress code. The restrictions imposed on women and girls heighten their vulnerability to gender-based violence in public and in private. Domestic violence has increased, especially as women and girls are confined inside their homes. The lack of clarity in the legal framework on gender-based violence discourages women from reporting the incidents to the de facto authorities, preferring instead traditional dispute resolution mechanisms, which are also often not in line with international human rights law. The Taliban de facto authorities continue to implement the death penalty, with five known cases of public executions reported since 2021. The three most recent ones just took place in February this year. The European Union always condemns in the strongest terms all public executions. They are degrading and contradictory to human dignity. The European Union strongly opposes the death penalty at all times and in all circumstances. The European Union is committed to supporting the empowerment of women and girls and their equal access to work and quality education, as well as their full, equal and meaningful participation and leadership in all spheres of society. Through statements, through our delegation in Kabul and through our Special Envoy for Afghanistan, the European Union continuously calls on the Taliban to respect the human rights of the Afghan people. The European Union reminds the Taliban and Afghanistan that Afghanistan is bound by international human rights law and international humanitarian law. This means that they have an obligation to uphold human rights and are accountable for human rights abuses. The European Union supports strong monitoring and accountability mechanisms, including the human rights component of UNAMA and the mandate of the United Nations Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Afghanistan, Richard Bennett. As the largest donor to the International Criminal Court (ICC), the European Union acknowledges that the ICC investigation into the Afghanistan situation can be an important addition to ensure accountability. The European Union will continue to support Afghan human rights defenders and civil society in Afghanistan and abroad, with EUR 8.9 million, as they courageously struggle to defend the rights of the Afghan people, in particular women and girls. European Union actions include preserving and safeguarding documentation related to grievances, strengthening the resilience of Afghan human rights defenders, and contributing to maintain access to relevant and reliable information among the Afghan population, with an emphasis exactly on women and youth.",-,2024-03-13,"20.2.

Clare Daly,"Mr President, this week’s resolution on Afghanistan is a tour of force. It really is. Gaslighting, phoney feminism, weaponised concern: all the greatest hits. Twenty years of NATO war and occupation that visited suffering, death and destruction on the women of Afghanistan: according to this resolution, it never happened. The empowerment and consolidation of the Taliban from that war and occupation: again, that never happened. A reflection on the fact that the US invaded Afghanistan to save Afghan women, and that instead murdered and maimed them in their tens of thousands, and then left – and the vast, vast majority of them worse off than they were before. Forget it! The very last thing Afghan women need is more Western concern, more of the iron fist concealed in a velvet glove. Because until the West starts reckoning with the 23 years of violence and pain it has brought to the women of Afghanistan, then you’ll never be in a position to effect change.

This will mark the third year that girls will not be allowed to attend school. This is just the tip of the iceberg in the systematic process of elimination of girls and women from public life.

Seán Kelly,"A Uachtaráin, the situation in Afghanistan is alarming, with human rights violations occurring daily, including arrests, detentions, abductions, tortures and killings. Since the Taliban takeover, there has been a complete lack of accountability for these atrocities. Women and girls, in particular, have faced escalating restrictions on their fundamental rights, such as limited access to education, mobility and employment, effectively erasing them from public life. The recent public executions of three individuals, along with the Taliban’s discriminatory restrictions and harsh penalties, are deeply disturbing. The Taliban’s draconian crackdown on dissent and non-compliance with their strict dress code is a clear violation of human rights. It is crucial that we condemn these actions and demand accountability from the de facto authorities in Afghanistan. As the EU, we have a responsibility to address these continuous human rights violations and support the Afghan people, especially women and girls, in their pursuit of justice and freedom. We must fully support the establishment of an international accountability mechanism to collect and preserve evidence of serious violations in Afghanistan. This will be essential for future criminal proceedings and ensuring justice for the victims of human rights abuses.

Johannes Hahn,"Mr President, honourable Members, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Ms Kalniete, and the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive approach to the Commission proposal. The Commission believes its proposal strikes the right balance between continuing our unwavering trade support for Ukraine, while safeguarding the interests of farmers in the European Union. The proposal notably includes a significantly strengthened safeguard mechanism for the imports of products covered by the regulation, including an emergency brake for eggs, poultry and sugar, stabilising imports at average levels imported in 2022 and 2023. Furthermore, to provide further reassurance to concerns as regards the strong increase of grains from Ukraine, the Commission wishes to make the following statement on the monitoring of the imports of grains from Ukraine: Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine has disrupted pre-existing supply chains. The EU is providing support to Ukraine to resume normal flow of grain and other goods, especially through the Solidarity Lanes, and to ensure that exports of grain can reach the destination, including in particular in third countries and third markets, to support global food security. The Commission is committed to supporting Ukraine while also preserving the interests of the EU grain producers and ensuring a proper functioning of the grain market in the European Union. Given the importance of grain production and grain markets, the Commission will pay particular attention to the monitoring of imports of grain. In its regular dialogue with Ukraine, the Commission will address any issues brought to light by the monitoring. The Commission recalls that imports from Ukraine can be subject to surveillance under Chapter IV of Regulation (EU) 2015/478 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2015 on common rules for imports, which can take the form of import licensing, if the trend in imports threatens to cause injury to Union producers, and if the interests of the Union so require. In this regard, the Commission will be ready to use the tools at its disposal as needed. The Commission will continue to report regularly to the Member States on the results of the regular dialogue with Ukraine. For products covered by autonomous trade measures, the Commission recalls that the regulation also provides for a reinforced safeguard mechanism and is ready to activate it in the event of adverse effects on the market for one or several Member States. This statement will be included in the minutes of the plenary part-session. By supporting this file, the Union will send a strong message of continued support to Ukraine in these difficult times.

Nicolas Schmit,"Mr President, honourable Members, dear rapporteurs, dear shadows, let me first thank you for your very rich report. It stresses the importance of creating quality jobs with adequate wages and working conditions, fostering the right skills for today and tomorrow, fighting poverty and reducing inequalities. We stand fully behind your pledge that the European Pillar of Social Rights should remain our compass to drive actions that foster a strong social Europe. It is also a key part of the EU’s economic and social policy coordination in the European Semester. Parliament and the Commission are well aligned in underlining the importance of fostering upward social convergence in our Union. In this respect, the 2024 Joint Employment Report presents, for the first time, a stronger country-specific focus and analysis in line with the features of the social convergence framework. As a follow up, a deeper, second-stage country analysis is now being prepared by our services for those Member States for which potential risks to upward social convergence were identified in the Joint Employment Report. Upskilling and reskilling are crucial to support our economies and it is all the more important in times of big transformations and challenges, including sizeable labour and skills shortages. We will soon put forward an action plan to reinforce the labour market integration of all groups and to foster the EU’s inclusive and sustainable growth and this is also a way how Europe can improve its competitiveness. The national recovery and resilience plans include important reforms and investments contributing to addressing labour market skills and social challenges. This includes measures that contribute to boosting skills, to make Europe fit for the green and digital transitions, strengthen active labour market policies and improve social protection, including with regard to healthcare and social services. The forthcoming Semester Spring Package will also include important guidance on the mid-term review of cohesion policy programmes. In the context of the European Semester, which remains the central instrument to coordinate economic and social policies and the new economic governance, we will continue our efforts towards a strong implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights and the achievements of the 2030 EU headline and national targets on employment, skills and poverty reduction. Social policies and economic policies have to work hand in hand, as it was stressed by many yesterday at the Jumbo EPSCO-ECOFIN Council meeting. The new and more integrated approach to reforms and investments and fiscal policies in the new medium-term fiscal structural plans paves the way to factor in fiscal sustainability and fairness as part of one single policy programme. To tackle the challenges of the twin transition and to respond to the current geopolitical scenario, sizeable investment and relevant reforms are needed in the EU. This is at the heart of the European Semester and is also a key element of the new economic governance. The effective involvement of social partners in identifying policy solutions remains key to quality policy design and strong implementation and also represents a key feature of the new EU governance framework.",-,2024-03-13,12.

Alexandr Vondra,"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. It was very interesting debate. Just I noticed there were three different areas of remarks. One deals with the healthcare and the impact on the health in the cities, that this proposal, which we modified from the original proposal by the Commission, does not contribute to improving of the air quality. And that’s not true, because it introduced the stricter NOx limit for the buses and heavier cars. And this is the largest source of the problem. On the contrary, if we accept the original proposal, it would have even paradoxically devastating impact on the environment and the air quality, because the poor people, who would not have enough money to purchase new electric cars, and the automotive industry would squeeze out from the fleets the combustion cars already now, then this famous Havana effect will show up. Second remarks relates to the issue of technological neutrality, synthetic fuels, etc. Yes, I was in favour of including this, but simply there was a matter of fact that in this building there was not a majority for this. And even we had not the majority in the Council. So if you ask me as the rapporteur, I would wish to include this because I’m in favour of developing the combustion cars further with synthetic fuels and following the path of the technological neutrality. But to complete the job, we need a different Parliament. So let me conclude again that, despite all those doubts, I urge you to vote in favour of this, because this is the reasonable compromise which guarantees the balance between the environment and the interest of the industry, as well as the interest of the customers.",ECR,2024-03-13,14.

Finland is a model for many of us in many aspects. Finland is a model in terms of research and innovation, in terms of education, and Finland is globally a top-five country when it comes to defending the rule of law, fighting against corruption and defending the freedom of the press. And by the way, under the leadership of pro-European centre-right Prime Minister Petteri Orpo Finland is scoring better in defending European values than any country led by a left-wing government in Europe today. We have many things to do together. Let me choose two: security and competitiveness, two topics which the Prime Minister has touched upon. In the area of security, to protect European citizens, we will have to do more than we anticipated initially. We will have to do it faster, earlier and for a longer period of time. We will have to pool our resources together to make sure that our troops are well equipped with the most modern, most effective equipment to be able to protect the people in Europe.

And also thank you for protecting the Finnish border to the weaponised migration from the Russian Federation. Through your actions, you are protecting citizens everywhere in Europe. You are protecting a European border. On competitiveness, we need a strong economy to be able to protect our citizens. We need a strong economy to be able to safeguard our social model in Europe. We all want pensions, minimum wages, all to be safeguarded and secured. In this respect, we will have to invest in research, innovation, digitisation, free trade, complete the single market, create a framework which the private sector feels comfortable to invest in.

Europe needs to lift itself in order to stop Putin’s war policy and his policy of aggression. However, our Prime Minister is a man of softly spoken words. He says, for example, that he wants to build on the Nordic labour model in Finland, when his actions are actually dismantling it. He says that he wants to keep the Finnish carbon neutrality target, when they do no action to achieve it, neither when it comes to forest sinks or reducing emissions or promoting CCS that he says that they would like to promote. They just don’t do it. At the same time, he gave an interview to Politico last week about the far right Finns Party in your government, and you said that you have ‘moderated’ them by giving them ministerial posts. They are not far right anymore, you said. Well my question is, what party actually has changed in this government when Finland is facing unprecedented, historical strikes larger than in decades, with your labour cuts and your cuts on welfare, where a middle-income earner who becomes unemployed, a women with two children, can lose over EUR 500 a month?

Nikolaj Villumsen,"Madam President, dear Mr Orpo, normally I would be happy and proud to welcome a prime minister from another Nordic country here in the European Parliament, but sadly I have to say today I’m not. Instead, I am disappointed, sad and honestly angry to have to welcome a Nordic prime minister that is leading a charge against social and trade union rights in his own country. Mr Prime Minister, the topic today is ‘This is Europe’, and I have one thing to tell you: the Europe you represent, Mr Orpo, is not the Europe I want. And more importantly, it is definitely not the Europe citizens need. What you are doing is clearly wrong because you are undermining what makes a Nordic welfare state strong. Your government makes it easier to fire people, and at the same time you want to cut social welfare and protection. This will harm workers and their families. Yet sadly it doesn’t stop here. At the same time, you try to undermine the Finnish system of collective bargaining – a collective bargaining system we, on a European level, aim to increase, you are actively trying to suppress. I’m sad to say so, but that is shameful. As if this was not enough, you also want to limit the freedom of people to go on strike and protest your policies. But Prime Minister, when Finnish people protest you in the street, the solution is not to take away the possibility to strike. Instead you should stop, reflect and listen. Mr Orpo, the Europe you represent is clearly a Europe for the few; a Europe that does not take care of your citizens, of our citizens and the planet. Instead, it runs away from responsibility. Sadly, we have seen it before. Whenever the right governs with the far right, the picture is the same. Those that claim to speak for the common man quickly betray him. Those that say they have the ordinary worker’s interests and concerns at heart quickly and brutally betray her. And that is exactly what is happening in Finland. That is exactly what we are seeing right now. And that is the reason that people are protesting you and your government, Mr Prime Minister.

But this is the only game in town for Europe. If we do not lead this transition, China and the US will. So it is a matter of economic survival for Europe. It is not a detail of something that we can leave for later. Second: details. You say that we focussed on details. Setting ourselves the goal of climate neutrality – a detail? Regulations to reduce emissions in transport, in buildings, in energy – details? Absolutely not! What we did is focus on the bare essentials. There’s one point I agree with you on, which is that no, you cannot achieve everything through regulation. There I totally agree. But regulation sets ourselves targets and creates markets. So we need regulation. You cannot say okay, we should dispense with it. You didn’t say that, but you cannot at the same time say we need more carrots, but then we don’t want to spend money on it. I mean, what are the carrots if it is not public money? There again I see really a contradiction in doing it. If we don’t want to do it through regulation, it is going to be subsidies. That’s what the US are doing. That’s what’s China is doing. They do not do anything on regulation; they do everything on subsidies. We have a more balanced approach where we have both regulation – say ‘sticks’ – and subsidies, and that’s ‘carrots’. But if you say we need less regulation and we want less state aid, and at the same time you say we want more climate action, then something is wrong. It doesn’t work. You can’t have all this. Every study that looks at investment says we need between 2% and 2.5% of GDP extra on investment if we want to reach our climate targets. Of this, most agree that at least half should be public investment. There is no way around this. So this is a moment where we need to step up the public investment. Again, I would call on you to support these investments locally and at the European level rather than oppose them. Finally, Prime Minister, you know, I disagree with Manfred Weber on a lot of things. I disagree with Valérie Hayer on a lot of things. I disagree with Iratxe García on a lot of things, and with the far left as well. But at least we have a common base. We have a common base, and that is that human dignity is indivisible. None of us says that some human beings are inferior or implies this. And this is where I believe that people like us should never, never go into alliance with people who de facto consider some human beings as inferior. That’s what you did in Finland. I’m glad, Manfred, that your colleagues in Portugal are not going to do that.",Greens/EFA,2024-03-13,"6.

Iratxe García Pérez,"Madam President, dear Prime Minister, welcome to the European Parliament. Welcome to the House of the European democracy. The European people learned through great suffering that hate and fear are dangerous to democracy, a hate and fear that the far right has against those who they consider to be different, a hate and fear that are affecting the centre right within the European Union, where the far right has been allowed to be part of five national governments and hundreds of regional and municipal governments. Dear Members, Finland is another example of the regression and the decline represented by the alliance between the European People’s Party and the far right. Mr Orpo, do you believe that the best way to defend workers’ rights is to promote dismissals, undermine social dialogue and restrict the right to strike? Do you think that the best way to eradicate poverty and inequality is to reduce public spending on pensions, unemployment benefits, housing and parental allowances? Are you proud of your Finance Minister when she posts on social media with large scissors, expressing satisfaction at cutting people’s income and social security? Do you feel comfortable governing with a minister who declared himself a Nazi? And this person is still a minister. Mr Orpo, your alliance with the far right is the real threat to our democracy and to the European project. This is why the future of the European Union is at stake. And the question that we must ask our citizens is clear. What kind of Europe do we want? A Europe hostage to climate change denial or a Europe committed to fight against it and that makes the green transition an opportunity to create wealth? A Europe that undermines the sexual and reproductive health and rights of women or a Europe that defends the feminist cause and the achievements of women? A Europe of the elites or a Europe that protects workers in the face of the challenges posed by artificial intelligence and protects families in time of crisis, as we did during the pandemic on the war? Dear Members, in times of uncertainty and great transformation, it is not enough to simply try to resist the reactionary wave. We have to move forward. We need a European project that makes citizens proud again to be European, a project that is not guided by the fear, hate and pessimism of the right and the far right. Mr Orpo, Mr Weber, put an end to your alliance with those who want to destroy Europe. Let us continue building a Union that will be a beacon to inspire the world through its example of integration and progress; a Union with more democracy and more equality; a Union that makes the social pillar a reality with decent jobs and affordable housing; a Union that is more united and also more open; a Union at the forefront of the fight against climate change, committed to human rights, and that places people at the centre of the digital transformation. Mr Orpo, Mr Weber, your only enemy is the far right. In the last century, your political family made a mistake by opening the door to the far right, and Europe and the world paid a high price. Now, let us say no to the darkness and yes to more years of hope and progress.",S&D,2024-03-13,"6.

Manfred Weber,"Madam President, Madam Vice-President, dear Prime Minister, dear Petteri, first of all, thank you for addressing the European Parliament and as an EPP Group leader, I want to congratulate you for the trust you received from the Finnish people for being elected as Prime Minister and after your success, Alexander Stubb was elected as President of Finland. So it is in good safe EPP hands today, thanks to the trust of the Finnish people. Finland is a true EPP – European – success story, and also an EPP success story. The first country in Europe to introduce a universal election law for parliamentary elections in ‘96. In ‘97, when women had no voting rights in most of Europe, they were already 19 members in the Finnish Parliament – women, female members – in the Finnish Parliament. Since gaining independence in 1917, Finland has made an incredible journey: from being one of the poorest countries in Europe, it has become one of the most successful. And today, Finland is a European leader in gender equality, climate policy and innovation. Probably it has something to do with ‘sisu’, the special determination that defines the Finnish national character. And, dear Petteri, you and Kokoomus have definitely shown some special determination in always standing up for Finland’s accession to NATO. The Finnish Socialists and Greens changed their minds about joining NATO only after the invasion of Ukraine, while already in 2018, you were warning Europe, I quote: ‘The crisis in Ukraine, recent terrorist attacks and hybrid threats have shown that both the EU’s defence cooperation and NATO are needed and that they can complement each other.’ And that is really true EPP leadership. Finland makes both NATO and the European defence stronger. Not only do you bring the strongest artillery in Western Europe, an army capable of fighting in -40 degrees, but also the experience of guarding Europe’s longest border with Russia. Finns know what it means to have Russians as neighbours. Like the Ukrainians, you fought in cold trenches and frozen forests to stay free. The only difference is that you stood up to Stalin alone, whereas today we stand together against Putin. This means not only supporting Ukraine as long as this takes, but also stopping Putin’s hybrid warfare against the Finnish border, as you said. Finland also is currently building up a fence to protect our external border. We, as the EPP do what is necessary to do and, dear Petteri, the Finnish border is a European border, as you said. The Finnish border is NATO border. No dictator can use illegal migration as a weapon to blackmail us as Europeans. Standing together always means to build up also a competitive Europe. And when it comes to innovation, the Finns are hard to beat. Finland is today a world leader in digital infrastructure, the first country in Europe to build up a 5G network and it is already ready to implement 6G. Finland, Europe’s forest, has made innovation the basis of its climate policy. Companies are investing currently EUR 200 billion, 70 % of Finland’s GDP, in our green transition. Almost 1 in 3 Finnish employees works directly or indirectly in the tech sector. So you are proving that innovation is the way to more, to better quality jobs. And how do we do so? High quality education, investment and research and development for more than 3 % of GDP and cutting red tape. To become more innovative, Europe must become more like Finland. Dear Petteri, your leadership is making Europe stronger, safer and ready to face not only today’s challenges, but also tomorrow’s challenges. Thank you for being with us.",PPE,2024-03-13,"6.

Petteri Orpo,"Madam Speaker, dear Roberta, honourable Members of the European Parliament, fellow Europeans, it’s good to see you. Many familiar faces here today. I am happy to be here at the European Parliament – a building I have visited numerous times, previously as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Minister of the Interior and Minister of Finance. Today, I stand before you not just as the Prime Minister of Finland but also as a committed European, eager to share Finland’s vision for a resilient, competitive and secure Europe. Now we find ourselves at a key moment in history, one that calls for our courage, unity and determination. We have returned to the very fundaments of European integration: promoting peace and defending our values. The ongoing war in Ukraine is not just a conflict on our continent’s borders; it is a stark reminder of the fragility of our peace. It threatens the very principles on which our Union was built. As Europeans, it is high time for us to wake up and smell the coffee. This is the defining challenge of our generation and our continent. Finland, which shares a long border – more than 1 300 kilometres – with Russia, understands the significance of this moment. Finland has never dropped the ball when it comes to security and defence. After the Cold War, we remained committed to maintaining a credible and independent defence capacity. Our decision to join NATO is not one we took lightly; it was a clear signal of our commitment to European security. Now we are happy to finally welcome our close neighbour Sweden to the Alliance. Welcome. (Applause) The war in Ukraine has been a wake-up call for all of us. We must never again be so reliant on others for our energy and security. We must take care of our own defence. Ramping up our defence industry, improving our preparedness and strengthening our borders are critical pillars of our shared security architecture. We are living in a time where practically all policy fields are linked to our security, and without security, we cannot ensure a prosperous future for Europe. For us in Finland, the EU is the most important political and economic frame of reference and community of values. My Government is committed to a strong European Union – an EU that acts, not only reacts. We want to build a Union that takes care of our common security and works for our economy. Upholding the rule of law in Europe must remain our core principle. Today I have three main points for the future of Europe and the next mandate. First, we have to strengthen Europe’s strategic competitiveness. The reason our economic competitiveness is so crucial is simple. Europe is falling behind in productivity. Our standard of living is diminishing compared to others. The United States and China are experiencing faster growth and attracting investments. Should this trend persist, we will no longer be able to stand on our own feet. We must build our competitiveness by developing our strengths and through market-based solutions, with a fully functioning internal market at the core. This foundation will enable us to thrive in an increasingly competitive global landscape. We need to cut the bureaucratic red tape, implement sustainable fiscal policies, reform labour market regulation, and conclude new trade deals. We must foster innovation and skills, strengthen our internal market and ensure significant funding for innovation and research. These initiatives are the bedrock of long-term competitiveness. There is an immense need to finance our defence and the green transition, as well as broader competitiveness-enhancing policy areas like research and innovation. We must also utilise existing instruments more effectively. This means reforming the next MFF and seeking more financial resources from the markets, for example through the EIB and by developing the Capital Markets Union. We need a true European Investment Union. It is essential that we make investing in Europe attractive again. The urgency of reverting the State aid rules to their normal framework has become increasingly apparent. The escalation of State aid competition threatens the very core of our single market. Such competition can lead to a race to the bottom, where countries with deeper pockets can unfairly support their domestic industries. The principle of a single market is founded on equal opportunities for all, not a fragmented landscape where walls are built and financial muscle overshadows market dynamics. It is crucial that we restore the normal State aid rules. A healthy single market benefits all European citizens and business – today and in the long term. Jacques Delors, father of the European single market, would indeed be deeply concerned by the current practices regarding the relaxation of State aid rules. The dilution of these rules risks undermining the level playing field Delors worked so tirelessly to establish. When it comes to our trade policy, we must refocus on the core principles of trade policy itself. Our setbacks have often stemmed from pursuing broad-ranging agreements with noble intentions and expecting our negotiating partners to commit to them. If we want to be globally relevant, we need a better ability to conclude, ratify and implement trade deals, not a better ability to bring them down. (Applause) The European Union’s trade policy is not only a vital instrument for boosting competitiveness; it has become crucial in building partnerships in today’s global landscape. Friends, secondly, we have to improve European comprehensive security. This includes defence and border security, but also preparedness more broadly. Firstly, ramping up our defence industry is priority number one. The European Union has the regulation and the resources, and we need to use those tools. Even as a member of NATO, we think that Europe can do a lot. NATO and the EU do not exclude each other – they complement each other. Next, on border security, Russia has weaponised migration to put pressure on Finland and the entire EU. Russia is pushing third country nationals towards our eastern land border. This is not acceptable. The numbers are still relatively low, but the phenomenon is worrisome. If we can’t stop this phenomenon now, it will also become a question of numbers and a greater threat to national and European security. Security at the EU’s external borders is at the core of the EU’s existence. Safeguarding our external front lines against any form of hybrid attacks is crucial. This is why our response has been decisive. We have closed our eastern land border and are in the process of preparing new legislation. We are doing this to protect the entire European Union. A hybrid attack on our border is a hybrid attack against the whole of Europe. Therefore, we need to evaluate our existing European legislation, to see whether it is strong enough to tackle these challenges in its current state. If not, then we must consider updating it to better suit the time we are living in. We must send a clear message: Europe is resolute in its defence, agile in its response, and firm in its commitment to the safety of its borders. In addressing the security of our borders, we must also focus on the people who live in these critical areas. Tourism and all cross-border trade has stopped indefinitely. The vitality of the EU’s external border regions is crucial, not just for national security but for the cohesion of our society. The war has caused the economic base in these border areas to decline. This trend, if unchanged, will lead to depopulation and pose a grave risk to the security and stability of our Union. It is necessary that we implement EU-level policies aimed at revitalising these areas and making them more secure against external threats. On preparedness. Preparedness for crises is one of the cornerstones of security. The EU and its Member States must be better prepared for a growing number of increasingly complex crises, as we have learned from the COVID-19 crisis, the war in Ukraine and the energy crisis. It is in everyone’s interest to improve the level of preparedness of all Member States and the EU as a whole. In this context of preparedness, Finland stands ready to share our experiences of resilience and readiness. Our nation has long been recognised as a superpower in preparedness. It is a status born out of necessity and reinforced by our history and geopolitical position. We have developed comprehensive strategies that cover all sectors of society, from public to private. Our approach to preparedness includes not only physical defences but also societal resilience, which is critical in facing both conventional and hybrid threats. I believe Finland’s model of preparedness could offer valuable lessons for the European Union. By adopting similar comprehensive and forward-thinking strategies, we can enhance the resilience of the entire Union. This is why we ask the Commission to develop and publish the first EU strategy for a Preparedness Union. This should be based on a whole-of-society approach, where the needs and contributions of all political sectors are taken into account. We are not suggesting another policy document; we are calling for an innovative blueprint that ensures the European Union’s resilience in the face of complex challenges. Our third priority has to do with the environment and climate. With the right kind of climate policy, we can strengthen our security of supply, boost our economies and improve the supply of European raw materials. The Government of Finland is committed to reaching the climate goals. We think that while tackling climate change, we can also create jobs and phase out fossil fuels. We have the technology and know-how for this here in Europe. We must emphasise a clean transition that leverages the bioeconomy and circular economy. With clean energy – in the form of nuclear power, wind power, solar power and biomass – we will attract industry that can produce and export these clean solutions. We should combat climate change and support biodiversity in a way that recognises the diverse circumstances across the Member States. A technology-neutral, cost-effective clean transition will pave the way for sustainable growth. The bioeconomy and renewable natural resources are our allies in reducing emissions and diminishing harmful dependencies on third countries. As we look towards the next legislative term, it is important to admit that our environmental and climate goals cannot be achieved through more regulation alone. Regulation has been necessary and will continue to be, but our approach thus far has focused too much on the details, losing sight of the broader picture. We must have proper impact assessments. In the upcoming term, we must recalibrate our climate policy and shift away from overly detailed regulation to fostering innovation. We need carrots and incentives, not sticks and bureaucracy. (Applause) As I approach the end of my speech, I will turn back to the situation in Ukraine. I say it is our job as leaders to fight against any pessimism and to show an example and leadership. Everyone has to wake up. Russia continues to commit war crimes in Ukraine. It has shifted to a war economy. Russia is evidently preparing for a long conflict with the West and represents a permanent and existential military threat to Europe. If we, as a united Europe, fail to respond sufficiently to this challenge, the coming years will be filled with danger and the looming threat of attack. We must bolster our support for Ukraine now for it to win this war and at the same time enhance our own defence capabilities and the ability to defend ourselves. (Applause) It is also essential that we offer a credible European path forward for Ukraine. Enlargement of the EU is a geopolitical necessity and a question of security. Ukraine has demonstrated its ability to defend itself, and the Ukrainian people’s resolve remains high. Their resilience and determination pose a significant challenge to Russian interests. Supporting Ukraine is not only a moral imperative but also a strategic necessity. The cost of Russian military success would far exceed the investment required to support Ukraine. Imagine what will happen next if Russia succeeds. I say that every euro spent on Ukraine today is a low price compared to the alternative costs if Russia wins. (Applause) We have already taken significant steps, but more must be done. Ukraine is fighting, and we have the resources to support it. Ukraine deserves a just and lasting peace on its own terms. Securing the agreement on the EU’s Ukraine Facility among all 27 Member States was crucial. Next, we need to deliver on ammunition production and agree on additional funding for the European Peace Facility and Ukraine Assistance Fund as quickly as possible. Finland is doing its share: we have increased our ammunition production, and I urge all Member States to do the same. (Applause) It is crucial to recognise that Russia’s military capabilities are limited, despite its attempts to hide this fact. Russia is not invincible. We can overcome this challenge if we pool our resources together. We have the financial means, now we need to demonstrate our political commitment. Self-satisfaction is no longer an option; our collective future depends on our ability to recognise and counteract the threats posed by an aggressive and militarised Russia. Strengthening our defence is not just a matter of national security – it is a precondition for preserving the peace and stability that have long been the hallmarks of European integration and prosperity. In this light, we have to amplify the European Investment Bank’s engagement in security and defence financing. (Applause) Recognising the EIB’s pivotal role in investment financing and as the EU’s lending arm, there is an urgent call to extend its capabilities beyond dual-use projects, especially in response to the growing demands within the European security and defence sectors. Friends, more Europe doesn’t and shouldn’t mean less America. The United States is and will be our most important ally and we must strengthen our trans-Atlantic links in both defence and trade. Dear friends, let us leave this hemicycle today with a clear resolve: to strengthen our Union, to secure our borders and to support our friends in need with more than just words. Our actions today will define the legacy of our generation and shape the course of history. The time for action is now. Thank you. (Applause)",-,2024-03-13,"6.

President,"Dear colleagues, good morning – hyvää huomenta. I am delighted to announce that we have the Prime Minister of Finland, Petteri Orpo, with us today. Dear Prime Minister, dear Petteri, welcome to the European Parliament. Thank you for accepting our invitation to address this House as part of our ‘This is Europe’ series of debates. Finland is a nation I know well and one that I can say holds a very special place in my heart. But allow me now on behalf of all Members of this House to reiterate the European Parliament’s appreciation for Finland’s commitment to the European Union – over your thirty year membership – to our shared values, and particularly for your support to Ukraine and to our collective security. Thank you, Prime Minister, for your personal leadership and your resolve towards strengthening our European project, for Finland’s support to a free and democratic Ukraine, and I wish to commend you on steering Finland towards NATO membership. Having a 1 400 kilometre border with Russia means that Finland is uniquely qualified to lead when it comes to Europe’s security and defence. It also means that Finland has faced hybrid threats in recent weeks and months that have put pressure on our systems. We understand that our security architecture must be able to respond to the level of threat our way of life is facing. Finland has benefitted from close to EUR 2 billion in recovery and resilience funds that will support Finland’s economy in the digital and green transition, and RePowerEU cleantech funds will continue to support Finland’s innovation and businesses on the road to sustainable growth. This is important to underline. And it is important – as I said in Helsinki last week – that as many Finnish citizens as possible continue to help shape the future of Europe and go out to vote in the European Parliament elections on 9 June.

Dubravka Šuica,"Madam President, thank you, dear honourable Members, I have listened attentively to your remarks, and thank you for your visions and for your proposal. I can agree that we have to give children a voice. As a preliminary draft assessment, the Commission believes that such an initiative would require analysis, preparation, building on existing initiatives and already available funding schemes, in close consultation with all relevant stakeholders. But coordination is necessary. These stakeholders would include – I will repeat – international organisations such as Unicef and key children’s rights organisations. The provisions and safeguards of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child will need to underpin this proposal, with the best interests of the child at the centre. It is also important to consult local and regional stakeholders, and especially children themselves, on their priorities and their needs, which could be broader than this specific initiative. Joining forces is key to make a change in children’s lives – together with the European Parliament, with Member States, local authorities, international and civil society organisations, practitioners, the whole society and children themselves. In this vein, I also want to thank this House for your engagement and partnership in making the European Union Strategy on the Rights of the Child and the European Child Guarantee a reality for every child. At this stage, we take good note of welcoming and underlying principles, and the importance of embedding children’s rights in local realities. We also note that this initiative seems to be at a preliminary reflection stage. To conclude, we therefore invite you to analyse this proposal in more detail, taking into account existing initiatives and mechanisms. We will evaluate your proposal. And I have to tell you, on a personal note, when I was a mayor back in 2000, I established a Children’s City Council so children could elect or select their own mayor, because we know that democracy starts at a very early stage. You might have noticed that we adopted in the European Commission the Defence of Democracy package, which was announced by President von der Leyen in this House. Today, we have to defend democracy – it’s obvious, unfortunately. So where do we start? We have to defend democracy from within. It’s not only about disinformation and something which comes from different third countries; it’s also within. We have to make our children be literate to differentiate between what is fake and what is a lie. What is true? What is this information? What is genuine information? So we have to start from a very early stage and this is what we are proposing. This is very important. We established the Children’s Participation Platform, which is now operational, so children can express their views there. So I think that this is very important. I see Ms Bischoff here remembering the future of Europe. You know that we incorporated one third of youngsters into this exercise, and youngsters for us are children from 16 to 25 years old. So we know when we talk about the future of Europe, we talk about their future. So how can you talk about them without them? And we want to have them in. I think this initiative is excellent. It’s always about resources, so let’s see how we can join forces and how we can find resources. So at this stage we take good note, but it doesn’t mean that we cannot develop this initiative in the next mandate. Thank you very much for this initiative and let’s stay in touch.",-,2024-03-13,4.

Dubravka Šuica,"Madam President, honourable Members, I want to thank you for presenting this initiative. Working on democracy and demography, we have the word demos, meaning people. Our work in the European Commission also signifies taking into account the views of all generations in our democracy. When it comes to children, I want to make the point that they are our agents of change. Throughout my mandate, children have made it clear to me that they are engaged citizens and eager to participate in their democracy. Equally, making children’s rights a reality in all dimensions must take place at all levels of governance. This includes the local level, the cities, the regions. This is where we can see how we can make a difference in children’s daily lives. The European Union continues to put children’s rights at the heart of its efforts. Just three years after its adoption, the Commission has delivered on the commitments to turn the Strategy on the Rights of the Child into action. It is about empowering local and regional actors to cover all dimensions of children’s rights. Everything from health and social inclusion to services and protection against violence. I would like to single out one key issue that we have collectively tried to address together throughout this mandate, and it is child poverty. In the European Union, one in five children is affected by poverty and socioeconomic exclusion. Many of these children live in cities, it is not only in rural areas. When it comes to the implementation of the European Child Guarantee, our key instrument to tackle child poverty, cities play a crucial role in delivery of services such as early childhood education and care, education, including school-based activities and healthy lunches, and also housing, which is a key problem in Europe nowadays. So it is essential to continue investing in children. It is essential to fully implement the European Child Guarantee. Also in the next mandate, child poverty in the European Union must be eradicated once and for all. Cities are key actors in democracy. The participation of children in political and democratic life is a right, it is also a necessity to make our democracies more resilient from within – it’s not only from outside. So children want and they have the rights to be included in developing solutions to their problems. They want to be involved in decisions at home, at school, in their cities, regions, countries, but also at the European level. That is why we have launched the European Union Children’s Participation Platform, together with children, civil society organisations and the European Parliament. I also want to thank the Intergroup for children because we really cooperate, this is very good collaboration. We, therefore, learnt about your initiative to establish a European capital for children with interest. In this vein, we also need to recall that any initiative involving children needs to be comprehensive. As you are probably aware, similar ideas have been developed at the European Union level. For example, the very successful European Capital of Culture, European Capital of Democracy – the European Capitals of Inclusion and Diversity Award also recognises the role that cities and local authorities play in fostering diversity and inclusion. The objectives that you set out with this initiative are at the heart of some existing funding schemes. The European Commission Citizens Equality, Rights and Values programme fosters children’s engagement and participation. It also supports citizens’ engagement and participation in the policymaking process. Civil society and international organisations have developed initiatives that aim at supporting cities in becoming more attuned to children’s needs, and empowering children in voicing their ideas. For example, a Child Friendly Cities Initiative has been led by UNICEF with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child since 1996. All these initiatives require a thorough and complex process of preparation and management. This would also require exploring all existing mechanisms which could already support such an initiative as the European capital for children. I will end now here, listen to your remarks and then, in the end, I will express our position.",-,2024-03-13,4.

Eva Maydell,"Few actions show the destructive and inhumane capability of Putin’s war more than the forceful deportation of Ukrainian children. Russian armed forces kidnap young and vulnerable Ukrainians and thereby strip them of their identities, separate them from their families and eventually assimilate them in their totalitarian state. Letting this cruelty go unnoticed and without adequate response will only embolden Putin. When the EU, an alliance standing for human rights, turns a blind eye to the suffering of Ukrainian children, Putin will feel emboldened to commit even more heinous crimes. I must reiterate my calls for strong responses. Most fundamentally, we must support civil society organisations that can save these children. These organisations already proved that they can bring children home, as they have done with hundreds of them. However, tens of thousands of young victims remain deported in Russia – far from their schools, families, and communities.",PPE,2024-03-13,3.

Hadja Lahbib,"Madam President, dear Members of Parliament, thank you very much for your contribution to this very important debate. Thank you for your commitment to truth and democracy. These deportations and forced transfers of children remind us of the darkest moments of the last century. Children are certainly the most vulnerable victims in situations of war and conflict. Since the start of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, over 19 500 Ukrainian children have been forcibly deported and displaced from Ukraine to Russia, with only 388 children able to return home. It is to say that yes, we must, we have to do more. The fight against impunity for the deportation of children – as well as for other war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Ukraine – is a priority for the Council and, I am sure, for you as well. The Belgian Presidency is firmly committed to continuing the efforts in the Council, in partnership with the Commission, to continue to provide all necessary support to Ukraine and the ICC to ensure that justice is done. And as Commissioner Šuica has just mentioned, in addition to the four arrest warrants issued, including one against Putin, sanctions have been taken against 39 people linked to these kidnapping and deportations. We will continue to investigate and to try our best to take back home as many children as we can.",-,2024-03-13,3.

Dubravka Šuica,"Madam President, honourable Members, there is no need to repeat what has been said here this morning. But I have to say that I would subscribe all the statements this morning but one, which was really horrible, by the pro-Russian guy, who tried to disseminate this disinformation, fake news and propaganda. To hear this was disgusting. The Commission is committed to continue supporting the work of the International Centre for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression Against Ukraine via Eurojust. The Commission aims to secure long-term funding for this institution and welcomes that the US will contribute with over USD 1 million to this institution. Eurojust’s Core International Crimes Evidence Database is fully operational to support the activities of the International Centre for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine. The Commission, together with EEAS, is committed to taking forward the discussions on the establishment of a special tribunal for the crime against Ukraine. This discussion has shown the magnitude of the commitments of all of us and that all of us share the same commitments, and we have to address this issue in a much heavier manner, if I may say so. Time is ticking, and we all need to do our utmost to ensure that these children return to their families and communities. To return the missing Ukrainian children is of vital importance to us in our work, both in terms of political priority and through various initiatives that we will continue to support. We must help millions of Ukrainian children overcome the terrible trauma that has been inflicted on them to enable them to regain a sense of normality and to regain their childhood in the end. Every child matters and every Ukrainian child represents Ukrainian future. This is a sentence with which I will repeat: Ukraine cannot be rebuilt without its children. In this way, we must ensure that Ukrainian reconstruction efforts and national reform processes mainstream children’s rights and needs throughout. This is something which I’m also in charge of in my demographic portfolio. Investing in children is an investment in Ukrainians’ future, in Europe’s future and in a safer world. So it is investment in humanity. To conclude, once again, Russia must be held accountable for these horrible acts. The European Union is taking action. Sanctions have been imposed on 39 individuals for the deportations and for this forced transport of Ukrainian children. We keep drawing attention to these horrible acts also in the international fora, which is also important. And, as I already said in my introductory statement, we cooperate under ‘Bring Kids Back UA’.

Miapetra Kumpula-Natri,"Madam President, I want to be very concrete about what can we do more. I think that when we talk about the children here, there is need for the battlefield help from our side. There is need for Ukrainian society to run. There is no nation during the war if you don’t have schools and electricity and systems in place. So we have done our best to also support these 50 billion. But for the children, once you get the children back or broken families back, what can we do to help them? One idea is these rehabilitation centres that we can create to give them a safer place, if you can find a safer place today in Ukraine. I think we also can help NGOs working very close to those front line and in the society. I think we don’t only need to give more, but give our hearts for the issue and look at the eyes of the children. There has been already one and a half years ago the UN declaration on these deported children and issue. And we just hear the numbers going bigger.

We have to withstand all those pressures and to fight propaganda and disinformation of Russian lifestyle as much as we can. Otherwise we will fail. We will fail miserably. Colleagues, why do the Russian occupiers separate and deport Ukrainian people? What are the reasons? First of all, it’s a part of the systematic destruction of the Ukrainian nation. It’s Putin’s plan: a Ukraine without Ukrainians. Secondly, the Russian occupiers are trying to compensate for their human losses in Ukraine, and they suffer greatly because of their aggression they started against Ukraine. This week, it was reported that there is a special programme in Russia to ‘Russify’ and indoctrinate deported Ukrainian children at schools who are prevented from returning to their homeland.

Jaak Madison,"Madam President, dear colleagues, and dear Ukrainian friends in the Chamber who are visiting us here, first of all, we are very, very sorry for all Ukrainian children and families who have lost kids to the Russians and who are kidnapped or forcibly deported to Russia. I would like to mention – because I have few minutes here left – they mentioned some kind of statements of the Russian propaganda, what we have heard for the last two years, and I’m afraid that there are very many people in Europe, and a few people in this Chamber, who also are believing this kind of propaganda. We have heard, probably in the TV channels or in the social media, that the Russians are actually protecting those kids because they are taking them away from the war zone and keeping them alive and safe on the Russian side. And that’s why they are like the real heroes and saviours, and we should be very thankful for the Russians that they are taking those kids from the Ukrainian side to Russian side. But the problem with the Russian propaganda is that normally something like 5% of it is true, and 95% of it is absolutely false, fake news, and this is also fake news. So it means that, for the Russian propaganda, you are attacking the neighbourhood country, you are killing them, you’re trying to occupy them, or you try to force them to do whatever you want they have to do. And then you say, ‘OK, but I will take those kids, thousands of kids on the Russian side, because we are the saviours, so we are the good guys actually here’. There are people who are really believing this kind of things. The second thing about the mentality of Russia, and there’s nothing new that they are deporting the people, so if somebody’s surprised in this House – because we should have one of the highest knowledge of the information above the Europeans – there’s nothing new of the Russians that they are deporting the people on the Russian side. That’s the old tactic. I would like to remind you, in about 10 days, there is an anniversary of the mass deportation from the Baltic countries. It will be 75 years when almost 100 000 people were forcibly deported to Siberia, to Russia, and very many of them died there – and the Russian propaganda, they are still saying today that actually, it didn’t happen, and if it happened, actually, they were the bad people. They were the capitalists who were too rich and they are taking money away from the poor people. But the fact is that 80% of them were kids and women, so I really don’t believe that the kids and women are really the capitalists who are like the labour people are forcing to the job. So it’s an old tactic for the lying and using the propaganda and the problem, of course, here is, now, that we are doing too less and too late. I was listening very carefully also to the representative from the Council, and it’s very beautiful and nice that we are opening all the investigations. Yes, we are putting the legal procedures forward, it’s great. Yesterday – I hope that you have watched this already – yesterday I was watching again the best documentary movie this year, 20 days in Mariupol. I don’t know how many of you have seen this. If you haven’t seen this, you have to watch this, you have to watch this. And the problem is that all the world is seeing: they’re killing the small kids, they’re destroying the city, we are watching on the news, and then we’re saying that, ‘Yes, but we have to open an investigation by the way, we have to take legal steps’. The problem is that we are taking too little steps to give the military aid to win the war, to really push back those Russians who are the real guilty and who are doing this kind of war crimes. That’s the only solution to end this war and help these kids.",ID,2024-03-13,3.

Rasa Juknevičienė,"Madam President, dear colleagues, dear brave Ukrainian girl, Valeriia, to date, around 20 000 Ukrainian children have been stolen from their homeland and deported to Russia, with only 400 having been returned. Since 2014, estimates suggest the number of these forcibly displaced children could be as high as 700 000. Many of these children are orphans or kids without parental care. Deportation – a war crime under the Rome Statute and the Fourth Geneva Convention – is being used as a weapon against the most vulnerable. The goal of this merciless policy is as clear as it is cruel: to erase the Ukrainian identity of these children and ‘Russify’ them. I grew up in Soviet-occupied Lithuania, so I know what ‘Russification’ and ‘Sovietisation’ means. The names of children are changed; their birth certificates are altered. They are bombarded with Russian propaganda and forced to attend Russian military processions. Their forcible deportation is not merely a violation of international law; it is a calculated act of cultural and national genocide, aiming to extinguish the very essence of Ukraine’s future. We call on the EU to condemn these actions and to recognise them as part of a genocidal policy against the Ukrainian people. We also urge the EU to establish a dedicated team and provide sustainable, well-funded support to assist Ukraine in identifying, returning and rehabilitating these children, and to continue supporting organisations like Golosy Ditey, which are crucial in these efforts.",PPE,2024-03-13,3.

Petteri Orpo,"Madam President, thank you for your attention and contribution. Thank you for the excellent European and domestic debate. A few comments on your remarks. First, Mr Weber, thank you for your strong support. On NATO, you mentioned it is important that today in Finland we are united. Almost all Members of Finland’s Parliament support our membership of NATO, and together in Finland we are building up a strong NATO in Finland at this moment, and I’m proud of it. Ms García Pérez – and for many others also – there are no far-right parties in my government. The Finnish Government is pro-rule of law; it’s pro-democracy; it’s pro-equal gender rights; it’s pro-Ukraine; pro-European Union. Many of you were worried about the reforms we are doing in Finland. But we have to do those reforms, because in 15 years our economy has not grown and we are going to lose our welfare in Finland. That is why we are reforming our economy. We are reforming the labour market, the social security system, taxation, because our target is to create 100 000 jobs for the Finnish people, so we can take care of all Finnish people and take care of our welfare state, education, healthcare, etc. This is clear. Ms Hayer, thank you for your strong words on our common security. The Arctic is a very important issue. Mr Lambert, thank you for your very wise words. There is a strong link between growth and climate. It is clear. The green transition will provide opportunities to our businesses. We do need regulation, but we need better regulation. And I want to also mention that we use EUR 1 billion to develop and research more in this period, because we need new innovations because of climate. Viro ja Suomi ovat hyvin läheiset naapurit, ja yhteistyömme Itämeren alueen turvallisuudessa, rajaturvallisuudessa, energiassa, monissa kysymyksissä ovat meille hyvin tärkeät. Vi har ett fantastiskt samarbete med den svenska regeringen och vi har reformerat våra arbetsmarknader till den svenska modellen. Eero Heinäluoman ehdotus ja tuki komission puheenjohtajan Von der Leyenin aloitteelle puolustuskomissaarista on erinomaisen hyvä, ja Suomi tukee sitä. Dear colleagues, to my conclusions. My main messages for this Chamber are clear and urgent. Firstly, we cannot afford to hesitate. The situation with Russia is not just a momentary crisis; it is a test of our resolve and our foresight. If we do not act decisively against the aggression now, we are effectively inviting future challenges to our borders and to the very ideals we hold dear. President Putin’s ambitions will not be curbed by inaction. He will be emboldened by it. Secondly, time is of the essence. Our words must now be matched by tangible action. We need to accelerate our defence production capabilities immediately. All these efforts require time – time that is slipping through our fingers even as we speak. The time to act is now. By working together, we can multiply our effectiveness. Naturally, bilateral help is needed, but the EU must also work collectively. The unity displayed by the European Union has been commendable. However, it is now imperative that we embark on the next phase of our collective journey. Our security cannot hinge on the outcomes of elections in the United States. Thirdly, and perhaps most critically, this effort requires substantial financial investment. As politicians, we are acutely aware of the numerous important and valuable demands on our budgets. For the past three decades, European nations have enjoyed the luxury of securing their defence at a relatively low cost. Regrettably, that era has come to an end. The stark reality we have faced today is that our safety and the preservation of our democratic values come with a higher price tag. This is not merely about allocating funds for defence. It is about ensuring the robustness of our continent’s economic foundation. Fourthly, Europe needs to be stronger on the world stage. The European Union, our way of thinking and our values are essential in the current geopolitical landscape, as democracy and authoritarians compete over dominance. The EU needs to show its strength globally, especially as China and Russia are bringing forward their own ideas and narratives. We need a stronger European foreign policy and we need to make it more effective, using qualified majority voting in important areas. Dear friends, a strong economy is the bedrock of our security. It enables us to invest in the advanced technologies and capabilities needed to protect our citizens and uphold our way of life. Moreover, a vibrant economy enhances our global influence, allowing us to shape a world order that reflects our values and our interests. Only when our economic base is healthy can we efficiently protect the climate, improve our security and defend ourselves. This is why we need strategic competitiveness. This means building our long-term competitiveness by focusing on our own strengths, deepening the internal market, boosting innovation and focusing on market-based solutions. This is a critical moment. We must be willing to make the hard choices that safeguard our future. Investing in our defence is not just a matter of national security; it is a commitment to the stability and prosperity of our Union. It is about ensuring that Europe remains a beacon of hope and freedom in an increasingly turbulent world. Let us, therefore, approach this challenge not just with the seriousness it demands, but with a sense of shared purpose. Our collective future, the legacy we leave for the next generation, depends on the decisions we make today. Let us invest together in that future, in our security and in the enduring strength of our European Union. (Applause)",-,2024-03-13,"6.

Dubravka Šuica,"Madam President, dear friends from Ukraine, dear honourable Members, dear minister, a generation of Ukrainian children has experienced more than a year of fear, loss, tragedy and violence. They had to leave life as they know it behind them. Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine is having a devastating effect on all Ukrainians, but especially on children. The European Union is not silent in light of Russia’s unlawful deportation or transfer of Ukrainian children. This is a terrible crime inflicting unimaginable suffering. The perpetrators of these crimes must be held accountable. These children must return to their families and to their communities. To achieve this, the European Union fully supports a number of different initiatives. The European Union participates in the Ukrainian initiative to bring kids back to Ukraine, supported by President Zelenskyy’s office. This initiative will unite the efforts of the Ukrainian authorities, foreign governments and international organisations and works on returns, on accountability and on prevention. In Kyiv, the European Union is part of the Group of Friends on Children and Armed Conflict in Ukraine with other foreign missions. The European Union will also continue to support and engage with the UN’s children and armed conflict mandate, and welcomes Russia being included in the ‘list of shame’ for the first time this year. We welcome the launch of the International Coalition for the Return of Ukrainian Children on 3 February this year. The European Union will continue to follow the work of the coalition closely and is currently assessing how it can best support the coalition and its activities. The European Union is also fully committed to take all necessary efforts to ensure that those responsible for the crime of unlawful deportation or transfer of Ukrainian children are held accountable. Seventeen Member States have so far opened investigations into international crimes committed in Ukraine, and the European Union is supporting these national investigations through strengthening judicial cooperation via Eurojust. Six Member States and Ukraine are members of the joint investigation team, to which the ICC and Europol are participants. In this vein, we warmly welcome and support the issuing of arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court. The fact that the court singled out the acts of unlawful force, deportation and transfer of Ukrainian children as the war crimes as a base for the first arrest warrant since the start of Russian invasion illustrates both the urgency and severity rightly attached to the issue. The European Union has so far supported the ICC with over EUR 10 million since the beginning of the invasion. The court is a key actor for consistency and enforcement of the international criminal justice system. The European Union has been and continues to support the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine to strengthen its capacities to investigate and prosecute international crimes committed in Ukraine. This also includes support for the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group together with the US and the UK. We have financed the IT advancement of the Prosecutor General’s Office with EUR 4 million. We are furthermore dedicated to support national investigations opened into international crimes committed in Ukraine. In addition, the European Union is committed to improving the coordination of various support efforts to the Prosecutor General’s Office through the international platform of the dialogue group.

Nicolas Schmit,"Mr President, first, thank you for this rich and important debate. Our exchanges today show that the European Semester remains at the core of the EU’s economic governance, providing integrated policy solutions, taking full account of the economic and social dimensions, while keeping a clear common sense of purpose in relation to the challenges of today and the ambitions for the future. I just want to say that, besides the coordination of our budgetary policies, we need indeed a better coordination of our economic policy. This was a point that was always asked by Jacques Delors, who always insisted on the need for better and stronger coordination of our economic policies. Now, policy efforts are importantly complemented by EU funding that supports Member States reaching these common policy priorities and ensuring upward economic and social convergence. The revised Economic Governance Framework should further support an integrated way of designing policy solutions, supporting sustainable and inclusive growth. So a number of speakers have mentioned one of the major social crises in Europe – the housing crisis. Your report mentions that adequate and secure housing is becoming unaffordable for many in all Member States of the EU. Indeed, this critical social issue has an impact on income, on labour markets, on poverty. At a recent conference, Madam Minister, organised by the Belgian Presidency, there was a large consensus among Member States that the Union has to be more active to tackle this housing crisis. It is a key priority for us to ensure that the European Pillar of Social Rights and housing is also a principle – it is Principle 19, if I remember well, of the Pillar of Social Rights – that features prominently among the common EU priorities that will inform such an integrated approach. Due attention will continue to be paid to upward social convergence. Let me also stress that, going forward, the continuous dialogue with this House will remain a particularly important element of the European Semester. Only with our joint efforts and commitments can we ensure that our European social market economy continues to be successful, both in Europe and on a global scale, and also in the context of the green and digital transformations and inspiring ideas of inclusiveness and social progress in other parts of the world.",-,2024-03-13,12.

Loránt Vincze,"Madam President, the agreement on the directive on asset recovery and confiscation had very broad support in the Parliament in all the phases of negotiations. Allow me to highlight some elements of this new tool in fighting organised and cross-border crime. The new confiscation framework of assets deriving from criminal activity targets the core motivation of organised crime: financial gain. Their profits are estimated at EUR 150 billion in the EU. Yet currently only about 1% of proceeds from organised crime are confiscated. Why is this so? We cannot confiscate if we cannot find out swiftly what assets criminals possess. It is difficult to confiscate assets the criminal origin of which is skilfully concealed, and cross-border exchange of information, even within the EU today, is limited and slow. The negotiated text will change the situation on all these fronts. Asset recovery authorities will have almost immediate access to all the relevant national asset databases, and they will be able to freeze criminal assets before they dissipate. Loopholes used by criminals to avoid confiscation will be closed by non-conviction-based confiscation or confiscation of unexplained wealth linked to criminal activities. Asset recovery offices will be mandated to swiftly exchange information with their counterparts in other EU Member States, and victims’ rights are now also better protected.

Bas Eickhout,"Mr President, colleagues, Commission, thank you, we are standing here for a pretty disappointing deal, to be very honest. We all know that the most effective way of dealing with pollution is source policies – making sure that at the source, we are reducing it, and we are hardly doing that in this deal. First of all, and this is a question to the Commission on the cars, or the light duty vehicles: it is the same as Euro 6. So can you not just now already say that you are not going to use Euro 7and just call it what it is? It’s Euro 6. If not, then probably we need your green claims proposal because it will be greenwashing by pretending that we are cleaning up the cars more, although they are not. So let me be very clear on that. But secondly, by failing at the European level with these very efficient source policies, we are pushing all the responsibilities to local communities and to local governments. In the cities, they will be forced to act on it, because it is the people that are breathing bad air in those cities and it is partly because of road transport. And this means that we are now pushing the responsibility to the local governments to put in ‘Umwelt zones’ and all that. And then, of course, the same politicians here agreeing with this will start complaining about it. But that is the result of complacency here, we are pushing the responsibility to there where they can hardly act. And that is a failure of this proposal. So the Greens will vote against it.",Greens/EFA,2024-03-13,14.

Elisa Ferreira,"Mr President, dear rapporteur Alexandr Vondra, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I am intervening in the name of my colleague Thierry Breton, and I want to share with you that the adoption of the Euro 7 Regulation by Parliament and Council in this cycle is crucial to reduce pollution from motor vehicles and to give industry planning certainty for their investments. The automotive industry is in a huge transformation process towards the zero-emissions vehicles. Uncertainty on emission rules would have affected investments, and our cities and our citizens have been waiting for updated rules to reduce air pollution from road transport given the strong impact on health. Regardless of the different positions of political groups on certain elements of the regulation, there is a broad consensus on the objectives. Euro 7 needs to contribute substantially to improving air quality, while maintaining the affordability of vehicles and the international competitiveness of our industry. Therefore, the Commission is pleased that Parliament and Council found a provisional agreement at the end of last year. While the agreement is less ambitious than the Commission proposal regarding the exhaust emissions of cars and vans, it will overall provide a robust framework for the future. Euro 7 will notably reduce significantly the exhaust emissions of lorries and coaches, for which the potential for further air-pollutant emission reductions is particularly high. The European Union has long been a global leader with regard to emission standards, providing our automotive industry with an important advantage on the global market. With the rapid shift towards electrification, non-exhaust emissions from brake and tyre abrasion will soon represent the lion’s share of road-particle emissions in Europe. Euro 7 contains future-proof rules for emissions from brakes and tyres that will remain valid for zero-emission vehicles. The introduction of tyre abrasion limits is also essential to reduce microplastics in the environment. Euro 7 also introduces minimum performance requirements for battery durability, and this is important for the confidence of consumers in electric vehicles. I welcome the strong support from the Parliament on all these future-proof elements of the Euro 7 Regulation, as well as on the technology of the on-board sensor, in order to improve compliance of vehicles over their full lifetime. The agreement gives us a tight deadline of 12 months to deliver all the relevant implementing acts for cars and vans. I can assure you that Commission services are fully mobilised to deliver on this secondary legislation on time. Once again, I would like to thank the Parliament for your commitment and constructive approach during the codecision process.",-,2024-03-13,14.

Alexandr Vondra,"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today’s vote is an important milestone for the automotive sector, an industry that has always stood as a pillar of innovation and economic prosperity in Europe. Almost 17 months ago, the Commission published its original proposal. In short, it sets the common standard for approving motor vehicles, engines and related systems, components and technical units, but unlike the earlier EU regulations, covers light duty cars, vans and heavy duty trucks and buses, all within a single legal framework. Its purpose was to streamline the rules governing vehicle emissions, tighten requirements on the tailpipe pollutants and, for the first time, add rules that will also affect electric cars, for example on the brake oppression and on tyres that release microplastics, as well as requirements concerning battery durability. I ordinarily welcome efforts to improve the legislation. However, as a parliamentary rapporteur, I strongly oppose the Commission’s initial draft. My main concern was the potential impact both on industry and customers. The Commission-proposed changes, particularly to vehicle testing requirements, would increase manufacturing costs and raise prices for small budget cars, which are essential for working people and rural communities. Higher prices would result in the market withdrawal of specific models and potentially in a ‘Havana effect’. This could lead to people postponing new purchases or only buying second-hand vehicles, and would be disastrous for everyday consumers and the automotive sector. It would also paradoxically redirect investment away from electrification. For that reason, it was crucial to find a good balance between the environmental growth and manufacturer and social interest. This was largely achieved with the adoption of Parliament’s first reading mandate, following constructive and fruitful negotiations with the EPP, Renew, ECR and ID groups. Thankfully, the Council shared my concern and adopted a negotiating position close to that of Parliament. An agreement was reached at the end of the Spanish Presidency – a deal that, in my opinion, represents a fair, reasonable compromise. For passenger cars and vans, it maintains the Euro 6 exhaust limits for buses and trucks, and introduced the stricter NOx emission limits, a key pollutant affecting air quality in towns and cities. Crucially, however, Parliament and the Council recognise excessive costs that would be imposed on the sector if the existing testing conditions for vehicles were revised, as originally specified by the Commission. Therefore, the testing parameters for light and heavy duty vehicles are unchanged from the Euro 6. The deal sets brake particle emission limits for cars and vans, and introduced the tyre abrasion limits in line with international adopted standards by the UN. It also sets the minimum performance requirements for batteries. The deal contains stricter lifetime standards up to 200 000 km/10 years, guaranteeing the better result, return of investment. Importantly, it also includes the phased implementation plan, providing the sector with credible and cost-effective lead-in times. I believe that the interinstitutional agreement we have reached is a triumph of common sense over the entrenched ideology, and I urge you, my fellow parliamentarians, to support this deal.",ECR,2024-03-13,14.

Nils Ušakovs,"Mr President, a couple of words about the walls at the borders and the European Union budget. In Latvia, the second largest city of Daugavpils is located roughly less than 30km away from the Belarussian border. Likewise, major cities like Ludza, Krāslava or Dagda are located within the same proximity to the Russian border. Building walls or any other military or border control infrastructure will definitely increase security, but that comes at a cost. That will bring the level of investment in this region – the region of Latgale – basically down to zero. You cannot build walls, you cannot dig rows or put anti-tank defences and expect economic growth at the same time. It just doesn’t work that way. And that clearly means we need a stronger, proactive role of the European Union and its budget.

This fund pays a monthly income to every Palestinian and their family who commits a terrorist act. The more people the terrorist kills, the more money the Palestinian Government pays. If we as the EU continue to finance that, we are idiots. If we are brave enough to freeze funds for EU Member States such as Hungary and Poland we must also be ready to be tough with the Palestinian authorities now and say either the Martyrs Fund ends now, or EU funding ends now.

Andrzej Halicki,"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Commissioner, at the very beginning, I would like to thank Victor Negrescu, who was the rapporteur, for the very good cooperation and the job, which was really a teamwork. And this is very good for ECAS, for the future, because it is the first step on the way to adopt the budget. But this first step is really done as a teamwork together with a very good – I think – result because the report is balanced. The result is also unique because not one amendment was tabled from the main political groups. We have a lot of amendments from the radical left, radical right, radical right wing, but I think generally they are out of scope. So if we will go this way, I feel that we will have the opportunity to work together after the elections to adopt the particular budget for the next year. This is a very important year because not only the first one after the elections, but also the year of the Polish Presidency, so I have in my heart also Polish priorities, and I have to say thank you, Victor, once more, that these priorities are also included. We have very tough times, so of course, security is number one, and we have a lot of wording on that, including even military mobility. This is something completely new. But I would like also to emphasise from my Polish experience, our Polish experience, very important paragraphs focused on the rule of law: without rule of law, democracy doesn’t exist. So the special programme dedicated to NGOs, citizens’ rights and values – I was the rapporteur of that – is also emphasised in this report, which is very important. Of course, many of the priorities are mentioned by Victor during his speech. I would like to, in the end, also say that we have to be very careful for the farmers’ expectations. We have to have in mind that the many expectations from the citizens we have to fight also with the high cost of energy. A lot of things are mentioned in the end.

Johannes Hahn,"Mr President, honourable Members, first I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs and the Budget Committee for the draft guidelines for the 2025 budget. The 2025 budget will fully implement the recently adopted revision of the multiannual framework. So let me again stress how important the first ever revision of the MFF ceiling was. It provides a stable framework for support to Ukraine and provides reinforcement for the priorities identified, as well as a solution to the financing of the costs of the NGO borrowing. Thanks to the Ukraine facility, we will continue providing a response to the constantly changing circumstances by supporting the suffering Ukrainian people while also preparing the country’s reconstruction in preparation of the EU accession. Overall, an additional EUR 21 billion was agreed to finance our common priorities. To mitigate the impact of the revision of the MFF on national budgets, it was agreed that the increases will be partly compensated by redeployments and reprioritisations within the Union Budget. We have already presented the first step of the implementation of this revision: the proposal for the draft amending budget No 1 for 2024, adopted on the same day the MFF revision entered into force. However, we will only be able to present the full impact of the MFF revision with the draft budget accompanied by a detailed financial programming for 2026-2027. There you will see how we propose to operationalise the MFF revision by programme, budget, line and year. Looking ahead, next year’s budget comes at a very challenging time for the Union. While the MFF revision has secured substantial additional funding for most of the Union’s priorities and also increased the availabilities for special instruments, the room for manoeuvre to respond to unforeseen events is still very limited. High inflation and persistent uncertainty and risks mean that we all must remain vigilant and cautious. At the same time, we must ensure adequate resources for existing priorities to continue work on long-term projects, notably to strengthen the Union’s strategic competitiveness and enabling the green and digital transitions. The Member States should swiftly make use of the available funding, both under NGEU and under the MFF, to deliver on the ground. The Commission will focus the draft budget 2025 on the most effective and efficient use of our limited resources. Therefore, all institutions should very carefully assess their needs for 2025 and respect the rules, especially for non-salary expenditures, for which increases should be kept under 2% – and of course to respect the stable staffing principles. I would say reassessment and reallocation of resources are key words in that context. I have noted that both the European Parliament and the Council in the guidelines stressed the need to ensure an adequate level of payment appropriations. I can assure you that the Commission monitors the needs on a permanent basis, and that an adequate level of payments will be proposed in the draft budget, taking into account the stage of the MFF cycle. 2025 should be a year when we finally reach cruising speed on all our programmes. Let me now turn to our next steps. In the first trilogue on 9 April, we will discuss the calendar for the budgetary procedure for the financial year 2025. The Commission aims to adopt the Commission’s statement of estimates on 12 June and to submit the full draft budget, of course in all language versions, on 8 July. Honourable Members, we have succeeded over the past years to agree on many groundbreaking files that have changed the Union’s budgetary and financial landscape, and therefore I trust that with our continued cooperation, dialogue and willingness finally to compromise, we will reach a timely agreement on next year’s budget.",-,2024-03-13,13.

Valdis Dombrovskis,"Mr President, colleagues, in the last few years Europe has endured one shock after another. Nonetheless, the European economy has shown remarkable resilience. Unemployment reached a record low, and employment stays at the highest level ever recorded. Europe’s strong and coordinated policy response has been effective. Yet it has not been easy. Growth has lost momentum last year in the context of high inflation, high energy prices, disruptions in supply chains and tighter financing conditions. While a moderate uptick is expected this year and next, challenges remain. This year, the European Semester cycle will continue to focus on the most pressing policy issues in the economic and social area. It will provide analysis and advice to Member States to improve their competitiveness against the backdrop of green and digital transformations, as well as current geopolitical challenges. A continued close interaction between the European Semester, the RRF and other EU funds will be ensured to facilitate consistent policy-making, considering country-specific challenges as well as common EU priorities. Also, the mid-term review of the EU’s Cohesion Policy will ensure that our investments will remain focussed on the most pressing needs for the economic and social development in each and every region. Finally, a swift implementation of the new EU fiscal rules, which I hope this helps to formally approve in the coming weeks, will be a key pillar on our policy coordination going forward. This will continue to take place within the context of the European Semester, which will remain a central tool for economic and social policy coordination in the EU.

I also take note of the public announcement by the European Public Prosecutor’s Office that the EPPO are also investigating the matter given the alleged criminal element and potential link to EU funds. The main thing I can say today is that we await the outcome of this investigation. It is important that we let the investigators do their work at this time, so that they can shed light on whatever fraud, of any kind, was committed against Union funds in the case we are discussing today. The European Commission continues to follow the matter closely and will report any information that can be useful to the investigations, as we always do. We remain in touch with the relevant authorities and stand ready to support their work as needed. The European Commission has zero tolerance for fraud. It is key that any suspicions of irregularities or fraud are properly looked into. Protecting the Union’s budget means protecting the money of European taxpayers and protecting our future as Europeans. No sector area of activity is safe from corruption risks. To further address corruption risks, the Commission presented a new anti-corruption package in May 2023 and I really welcome the statement of the minister that the Belgian Presidency will do its utmost to finish these negotiations still during its presidency. This package includes a proposal for a directive on combating corruption that will provide police and prosecutors with better tools to fight corruption. It will also map corruption-related risks in high-risk sectors by the end of next year. The Commission reports annually on developments regarding the prevention of and the fight against corruption in each Member State, while issuing concrete recommendations within the Rule of Law Report cycle. The fifth EU Rule of Law Report will be published in July 2024 and the fight against fraud is very much a joint effort from all levels, from citizens to public authorities, be they local, regional, national or European. I always greatly appreciate the steady interest and support by this House for the protection of the Union Budget and together we will make the best barrier against fraud of any kind and thank you so much for raising this issue today and be reassured we are tough on it.",-,2024-03-13,11.

Siegfried Mureşan,"Mr President, dear colleagues, corruption needs to be investigated everywhere, not hidden. And those who are investigating corruption, they need to be protected, they need to be supported, not threatened or intimidated. This should be valid everywhere, in every single corner of the European Union. Now let me say very clearly that the European Parliament is very concerned with the recent developments in Spain and the dangerous direction that the current Spanish Government is taking. Firstly, the amnesty law. The amnesty law is an attack upon the rule of law and it is also a breach of an electoral promise made by the government. And secondly, this new corruption case. Three top government officials very close to the Prime Minister are involved in accusations on misuse of European funds. And let me say very clearly that the European Union has zero tolerance for corruption and zero tolerance for misuse of European funds. To the Spanish people, I say very clearly that the European Union understands that you are disappointed. The European Union understands what is happening, and the European Union is concerned about the recent developments in Spain. The people of Spain should say loud and clear that they do not accept the use of their own money. While the European Union was fighting since the beginning of the pandemic to help Spain, while the people of Spain were making sacrifices, the government was misusing the funds. This needs to be clarified. It is right that the European Commission will be investigating the amnesty law, and it is right that the European Public Prosecutor’s Office will be investigating this corruption case. The misuse of EU funds, the misuse of all taxpayers’ money, is unacceptable and should be investigated.",PPE,2024-03-13,11.

Andrey Kovatchev,"Mr President, dear colleagues, the left part of this Chamber – Socialists, Greens, Communists – are using every opportunity they get to attack EPP governments about perceived breaches of rule of law and misuse of power and positions. However, Portugal and Malta, which are governed by socialists, as well as these recent revelations about the Spanish Government, are the latest example of blatant corruption and disregard of rule of law coming from within your ranks, colleagues on the left. Corruption allegations within a socialist Spanish party and a proposed amnesty law are two very alarming developments. We are confronted with the misuse of millions of euros paid on ill-gotten commissions during the pandemic. Some of this might have even come from European funds. There are allegations of conflict of interest all the way up to the Spanish Prime Minister, the dismissal of officials cooperating with the judiciary, and the questionable bailout of an airline, as well as a secret meeting and exchange of 40 suitcases between a former Spanish minister and the Venezuelan Maduro Vice-President Rodríguez, who is subject of EU sanctions since 2018. These all are unacceptable acts of misuse of power and must be investigated. I call on the EU to investigate these grave allegations.

Some of you have wondered whether it is appropriate to hold such a debate in the European Parliament. Others stressed the importance of close cooperation with the European institutions in corruption cases such as this one. I strongly believe that this debate is essential, and I repeat, it is essential to protect European investment and to fight against all forms of corruption. The Council remains firmly committed to carrying out efforts in this direction, whether on the legal framework for criminal offences, as well as the development of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office.

Dragoş Pîslaru,"Mr President, dear Executive Vice-President Dombrovskis, dear Valdis, dear Commissioner Schmit, dear Nicolas, dear Minister, as we move towards a renewed Parliament and Commission, we must think about the legacy that we leave to our colleagues. The European Semester is a cornerstone of what the European Union does good for citizens. It monitors the progress of the Member States and issues recommendations in order to achieve economic and social convergence, territorial and social cohesion, and, in general, a better life for our youth and children, for our citizens across Europe. This year in particular, the report on the European Semester was written in the context of the review of the EU economic governance mechanism, and we tackled many challenges in this mandate and we made innovative steps in terms of European financial instruments. Therefore it was only a question of time before adapting the economic governance to the new realities. The same has to happen with the European Semester. The report that I am presenting I am presenting on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and I want to thank very much my colleagues. We really acted as a team this mandate. We delivered for our citizens, and together with the Commission and the Council, we set important steps in order to implement the European Pillar of Social Rights. We are not there yet. A lot of many things to do, but let us go first on how to understand the current challenges in the context of the Semester. First, how the uncertain economic outlook influences the cost of living, how the ongoing geopolitical conflicts are exacerbating poverty and social exclusion, how the green and digital transition can have a significant impact on the environment, economy and the people. How demographic trends such as ageing and brain-drain magnify disparities and contribute to skills and labour shortages. So this is the context that we are talking about. Second, the Semester can help through concrete and specific recommendations, and it is clear that we need the modernisation of several aspects of the labour market, as we have right now skill mismatches, labour market shortages, as well as great potentials and risks of the twin transition. Therefore the European Semester should look more specifically at innovation, in up-to-date monitoring, the data of the labour market and supply and demand for skills, creation of good quality jobs and implementation of retention strategies – as these are the best way to attract a skilled workforce, improving access to quality employment in society – especially for those groups at high risk of poverty and social exclusion, and further EU action to protect workers and ensure a decent level of income and the need for technical support – in particular for SMEs and start-ups – for training and recruitment of new skilled and qualified employees in line with national policies and capacities. Third, the Semester needs and we are talking about adapted financial instruments, and how can we ensure that all these recommendations can be put into practice if we don’t have the increased funding that we have been advocating for, dedicated to social objectives and promotion of future-oriented investments. It is necessary that all financial instruments at all levels must become less fragmented in their management, less bureaucratic and more blended and bundled. It is time to think about the introduction of social conditionality in the allocation rules of EU funds, as part of the Financial Regulation covering the EU general budget, and also the possibility to design more flexible individual adjustment paths for Member States, allowing them the fiscal space to undertake social investments and reforms needed for socially fair, green and digital transition. And last but not least, we need a democratic, a more democratic, accountable, transparent European Semester. We welcome the social convergence framework, an early warning system used for the first time in the 2024 multilateral surveillance procedure. And this can encourage the correction of risk related to social convergence. We need to fully integrate the framework into the Semester process from 2025. I will conclude with a final call for the future: we need a bigger role for the European Parliament in the European Semester. We launched the possibility to create a special working group in the European Parliament that should ensure dialogue with representatives of Member States, regional and local authorities, as well as stakeholders who should be also essential actors in the European process.",Renew,2024-03-13,12.

Valdis Dombrovskis,"Mr President, Madam Minister, Commissioner, honourable Members, first of all, I would like to thank our rapporteurs for the two reports that cover the key relevant issues for the coordination of economic and social policies in the EU. The European Semester plays a central role to coordinate Member States’ policies in those areas. It has been proven to be an effective and agile instrument throughout the recent challenging years. Its four dimensions – productivity, fairness, macroeconomic stability and environmental sustainability – remain fully relevant. The regular dialogue with this House is a crucial moment within the European Semester cycle and I am glad that in the context of the provisional agreement reached on the new economic governance framework, the dialogue with the Parliament has been further reinforced. This year, the semester will have a particular focus on addressing long-standing structural problems, including weak productivity, demographic issues – including ageing – and challenges linked to the green and digital transitions. If left unaddressed, these challenges may drag on growth, competitiveness and social cohesion for years to come. It requires tackling a variety of bottlenecks, more private and public investment, as well as structural reforms, amongst others, to make it easier for companies to finance themselves, to ensure that education and training systems equip workers with the right skills needed in the labour market, to make product services and labour markets more efficient, to improve business environments for companies, including by reducing the administrative burden. This year’s European Semester, with a deeper analysis on territorial and social disparities, will also inform the mid-term review of the cohesion policy funding expected by next year. This will provide an opportunity to assess the cohesion policy programmes and tackle areas where there are pressing needs and emerging challenges. It will also pay attention to complementarity between the RRF and cohesion policy and maximise their synergism. With public debt levels having risen substantially over the past years, and in the context of still high inflation, ensuring fiscal sustainability remains crucial. Debt and deficit levels need to be gradually reduced. As demands on public finances have simultaneously increased, particular attention should be paid to the efficiency, composition and quality of public finances. In particular, Member States should prioritise investments that support sustainable and inclusive growth. The recent provisional agreement reached between co-legislators on the new economic governance provides a strong anchor for Member States’ fiscal and structural policies. It focuses on improving debt sustainability, as well as on promoting sustainable and inclusive growth, contributing to the achievement of common Union priorities. Its swift implementation is now a key priority. A final word on the Recovery and Resilience Facility, which will continue to be closely tied to the European Semester. A full and timely implementation of recovery and resilience plans remains key to address structural challenges. Our recent mid-term evaluation shows that the RRF is helping to make our economies and societies more sustainable, more competitive and more resilient. It also shows how the RRF has produced a step change in the implementation of the country-specific recommendations and key EU priorities thanks to the combination of reforms and investments. At the same time, the mid-term evaluation has uncovered some areas for improvement and lessons to be learned, on which we need to reflect further, also with Parliament’s help. Thank you, Nicolas will complement this and other aspects.",-,2024-03-13,12.

Billy Kelleher,"Mr President, it seems that some groups have used this European Semester report to try to undermine the work done on finally reaching an agreement on the new economic governance framework for the EU itself. And this is clearly very disappointing. I actually believe that this is quite a good agreement, in the sense that it gives flexibility in terms of spending and ensures that we have sustainability and prudence as part of that particular package. So the European Semester itself should not be used for that purpose. From an Irish perspective, we did need to have flexibility and the economic governance framework to ensure that we were able to address a few fundamental challenges that are inherently causing pressures in the Irish economy. They are, namely, the issue of housing in terms of supply of housing, building, but also soaring rents. And these are two significant issues that do need state intervention to stimulate our housing market, to ensure that we can house our people. So I honestly believe that those that are making the argument to undermine the agreement that we have on the economic governance framework are doing it for reasons I simply cannot understand, other than playing absolute politics with it. But from my perspective, the Irish Government has an opportunity with the flexibilities in this economic governance framework to address the serious challenges of housing, both in terms of delivery and building, and also ensuring affordable rents for people.",Renew,2024-03-13,12.

Wopke Hoekstra,"Madam President, thanks to all the Members who have taken the floor to – if that is the way to phrase it – enrich this debate. There are four things I want to share with Parliament, Madam President, if I may. The first one is that I, of course, fully acknowledge that the debate is, and every debate is, almost by definition, not meant to be nuanced. And I’m also very much aware that it is campaign season. But I do feel compelled to once more state the obvious, and that is that we are facing a clear and present danger. It manifests itself every single year and certainly every single summer. Don’t take my word for it, but take the word of the citizens who experience the droughts, the floodings, every single year, and particularly every single summer again. Talk to them and listen what they require us to do. Secondly – and that is the bit of good news – there is something we can do about it. We need to do much more in the domain of mitigation, and clearly we need to bridge that with a just transition and with enabling competitiveness. We spent a lot of time also in the conversations we are having here on mitigation. But adaptation is, if you will, underappreciated, underdeveloped, and there is something we can do about it. It touches upon the concrete and the here and now, and I would hope that we will be able to unite on doing more on this particular part of the equation. Third – and I’m saying that to those who might have expected even more concreteness and even more actions in this plan – is this communication the end of it? Is it the beginning of the end? No, clearly it isn’t. It is at best the end of the beginning on our quest against adaptation. It is a direction of travel. It is not an implementation plan. What we do do is we highlight what we feel is necessary in terms of the governance, in terms of the tools, in terms of the policies and in terms of financing. I feel that at this stage, given where we stand, this is absolutely the right way forward. Will we be back? Absolutely. And I would be the first to advocate that there should be paid more attention by the next Commission also to the domain of adaptation. Fourth, and finally, let me get to one specific point that Catherine Chabaud – who, by the way, I admire from all she did in her previous walks of life – which she asked. Because she basically said, okay, out of all these things that are in here, what would you, what would I, what would the Commission think is most effective, most actionable? I think the fair answer to it, and the first part of my answer, would be that in order to really judge that I would want to have the dialogue with the Member States, because in the end they are the best judges of what they can most easily copy, implement and use together. But if I were now to articulate what the Union could do, I would probably go for the fourth pillar, which is mainstreaming the financing we do through the RRF, through cohesion money, and through all the money we are going to spend, and make sure that every single euro we’re going to spend in the future is actually climate-proof. If that is something we would do, it would matter a lot in terms of resilience going forward.",-,2024-03-12,"15.

Dorien Rookmaker,"Madam President, Commissioner, is this climate risk assessment report a call to action? First, let me say I’m happy that the EU made a small beginning with a risk assessment. But I’m worried about all the essential elements that are missing. This is a risk identification report rather than a risk assessment. It’s very high-level, very top-down, like the way the EU is organised. It is far too generic to be a basis for sound policies. And yet the simple fact that it is discussed today creates a dynamic of its own, which creates risk instead of containing it. This risk assessment has to be embedded in a risk-management framework so we’ll be able to choose the right strategy and policies to contain the risk we are facing. With any type of risk the key question is whether to avoid, transfer, mitigate or accept the risk we are facing. And this question needs an answer before we jump into the action mode.

Seán Kelly,"Madam President, the EU’s climate risk assessment report is a stark warning that Europe is the fastest warming continent in the world. For the EU, this should also be seen as an opportunity. It is now clear that our decarbonisation efforts are good for our economies and good for our consumers. Across the Union, the days on which we have the most wind or the most solar on the grid are the days when electricity is cheapest. By urgently accelerating the switch to a renewable-based system, not only do we cut emissions, we also make energy cheaper, we boost European competitiveness, we drive investment into European manufacturing and, critically, we end our dependence on external energy sources. There is no country better placed to contribute to this than Ireland, with our vast renewable sources and cutting-edge electricity market that can already operate with 70% renewables at any one time. We can be the powerhouse of the decarbonised electricity grid if the right strategies are put in place. I call on the Commission to set out its ambition to deliver a fully renewable energy system as soon as possible and give the needed signals for investment to the market.",PPE,2024-03-12,"15.

Billy Kelleher,"Madam President, this EU risk assessment indicates quite clearly the challenges that we face as a continent in addressing the climate change. My country, Ireland, has already declared a climate emergency and we have to act with urgency, both in terms of mitigation and also adaptation: mitigation in ensuring that we move to carbon-free electricity generation, wind, solar and also nuclear energy across Europe as well. And we must have interconnectivity across the entire continent so that our electricity generation systems can complement each other at varying times. We also need to have this debate based on science, based on research, ensuring that we unlock the creative innovation that’s on this continent. And that can only be done by ensuring that we have investment, both public and private, to underpin the advances that will be required in the area of generation of electricity. From an Irish perspective, we have a lot of work to do in increasing the grid to ensure it has capacity, to transport electricity across the island and to export it, to ensure we have investment in ports, in skill sets, and ensuring that we unlock the lethargic bureaucracy at Irish level in terms of applications for planning and ensuring that projects get the go-ahead to ensure that we can meet our climate targets and we can complement Europe in meeting them as well.",Renew,2024-03-12,"15.

I’m very happy that so many of you are convinced of the importance of labour migration and legal pathways for Europe and for our businesses – and so am I. The Single Permit Directive is a step forward to attract talent and better manage migration, and we show that the EU can manage migration in a comprehensive way. Unfortunately, there is no agreement yet on the long-term residents file, but negotiations will continue. Patient work and building trust will bring results in the same way that we found agreements on the Blue Card and the Pact, which not everyone believed possible. Of course, we are doing much more to attract the talent we need. We will continue to build talent partnerships with key partner countries: Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, Pakistan and Bangladesh. We are establishing the EU Talent Pool to match employers in the EU with jobseekers from third countries. We are simplifying and accelerating recognition procedures of the qualifications of third-country nationals, addressing the very high over-qualification rate of third-country nationals in the EU, which is currently at almost 40 %. Step by step, we need to make the EU more attractive to talent from outside the EU and to boost mobility within.

Ylva Johansson,"Madam President, Honourable Members, I would like to start by thanking the Parliament, the rapporteurs and the shadows, as well as the Spanish and Belgian Presidencies, for all their work on this file. I especially congratulate Javier Moreno Sánchez and Agnes Jongerius for this important achievement. This will help Europe attract the talent we need, building on all we have done during this mandate, such as the agreement on the revision of the Blue Card, which has fully applied since last year, making it easier to recruit highly skilled talent. To increase opportunities for regular migration, we need to decrease irregular migration, and for that we need to counter smugglers and step up on returns, and we need the Pact on Migration and Asylum. In December, you reached a historic agreement with the Council. The Pact will give us a solid foundation to protect people and to protect the external borders in a comprehensive, integrated and European way. The Pact also recognised the need for regular migration. 74% of small and medium—sized companies tell us they cannot find the people with the skills they need. Europe needs people of all skills, not only doctors and software developers. We also need bricklayers, carpenters, truck drivers, nurses, electricians, cooks, bus drivers, and many, many others. We need skilled people to support the green transition and a digital revolution. The need will only increase as Europe gets older. Europe’s working—age population will drop by about one million people per year due to demographic change. The old age dependency ratio is getting worse. Today, three working people support one pensioner. In 2050, it will be two to one. Firstly, reskilling and upskilling are an important part of the solution, and we need to be more inclusive. We need more older people and women to work, and work full time; we need to make it easy for people with disabilities to work; we need to give young people opportunities to enter into the labour market more quickly. However, this won’t solve all our challenges. We also need well—managed, regular migration in the framework offered by the Pact. That is why this agreement on the Single Permit Directive is so important. Today is a moment for celebration for the Single Permit Directive, but also to celebrate Javier Moreno Sánchez. A combined permit for residence and work, the new and improved Single Permit Directive offers better safeguards for migrant workers and better protects them from labour exploitation. The new Single Permit Directive will help us attract the skilled workforce we so desperately need in the EU. Today, once more, my warm congratulations on this achievement.

Tineke Strik,"Madam President, Commissioner, the Single Permit Directive is mutually beneficial, both for migrants who seek safe and legal pathways into the EU and for the EU wishing to attract skills and talent to its workforce. But in order for this law to be truly a win-win situation, we must ensure that migrants don’t end up as the losers. Too often, they are trapped in horrible situations of dependency and exploitation by shady employers. We now break this chokehold of abusive employers, and we empower the workers to enable them to change course. Single permit holders will have stronger rights, including a new right to change employer. They will be entitled to legal stay during unemployment and with three months extra for victims of violations or exploitation.

Cyrus Engerer,"Madam President, Commissioner, more efficient, simpler and harmonised migration rules are essential for the whole system to work. Malta, like the rest of Europe, is more and more relying on workers coming from abroad. Rather than hysteria and scaremongering from the far right that we have witnessed during the past years on irregular migration, we should really focus on legal and fair migration routes as part of a holistic migration policy. We must offer a safe alternative to smugglers and the dangerous routes that they use. I very much welcome provisions in this text which give more freedom to workers towards choosing new jobs and therefore new employers, and the improvement on equal treatment in relation to housing. These are key social victories for workers. When we strengthen the rights of migrant workers, we are strengthening the rights of our European workforce too – and this is very important to understand. It is completely incomprehensible how some Member States, like France, have blocked the recast of the Long-Term Residents Directive, echoing the words of the far right. I hope that this text today will improve the conditions of all people seeking to work legally in Europe, and I hope someone like Kusi Dismark would benefit from those provisions, that we would not witness again the shameful situation he had to go through in Malta.",S&D,2024-03-12,16.

Bas Eickhout,"Madam President, first of all, thank you, Commissioner, for your presentation and also for the communication. I think it’s a good summary of the EEA report of yesterday. So it’s great that the Commission has made that summary. But to be very honest, I would have expected a bit more of a political document from the Commission as a response to the EEA’s report. But maybe I was having the wrong expectations. Maybe just to put down some of the key conclusions of the EEA report: Europe is one of the fastest warming continents in the world, so climate change is hitting Europe harder. What is also clear from the report is that the social and economic cohesion of Europe is at stake because it will be the most vulnerable, suffering the most. And it is also very clear that the current policies in place are insufficient to manage almost 90% of the key risks identified. So these are all very serious conclusions from the report. So then I would expect the Commission to reply to that. For example, on agriculture – we always come to that. The EEA report is also very clear that the current CAP proposals are insufficient and are making it even worse. So I’m looking forward to the communication of the Commission this Friday, when they’re going to do something on the CAP provisions. But if I’m well informed, you will even simplify CAP provisions, making it even worse if we talk about what we need to do to address climate change. But maybe I’m not well informed and you can correct me. And maybe, finally, the Commission will take action on the CAP to make sure that it will improve the situation instead of worsen. Just a last comment: please, Commission, if you conclude your communication by saying ‘we will continue to work with the Member States’, we need a bit more action if the concerns are that serious.",Greens/EFA,2024-03-12,"15.

For many years, we’ve focus our policies on mitigating the effects of the climate change. We were convinced to have enough time to avoid drastic consequences. We did not pay enough attention to the consequences that climate change was already having, and the need to address them. With the Green Deal and the related legislation that we have adopted so far, the EU is leading the world in the fight against climate change, but mainly on mitigation. However, science is showing us that what we have done so far is not enough. Mitigation must continue, but we must adapt more rapidly, especially in southern Europe, islands, coastal areas and outermost regions. Phenomena like extreme heatwaves, intensive floods, severe droughts are intensifying their frequencies.

Věra Jourová,"Ms Kalniete, you got me to the situation when I have to admit I don’t have the figures here. But I can tell you that between 2015 and today we are increasing the budget of the External Action Service, which is dealing with the collection of data and analysis of the data of foreign interference, especially focusing on Russia through the East StratCom Task Force, which has collected, exposed and counted around 17 000 cases of pro-Kremlin information manipulation. In 2023 alone, this EUvsDisinfo system reached over 20 million people via its website and social media channels. And East StratCom Task Force alone, for example, directly engaged with well over 10 000 people last year via a number of trainings conducted by us, including to journalists, visitors, groups hosted, speeches given, and so on. I don’t want to fill in the time after admitting that I don’t have the money and the figure here. But I want to illustrate that over time, between 2015, when we already were under big Russian manipulation depicting Ukrainians as the fascists and narkomans and so on – the campaign started, and you know it very well, already after the invasion of Crimea – we increased the number of staff in our External Service. We increased the money through different programmes, like Horizon, or these training programmes. We increased also, in our Member States, the capacities. I would say the more we go to the east of Europe, the more capacities are used or deployed to counter the Russian propaganda. More than money and our own sources is maybe the fact that we managed by legislation to push the big digital players to take action against these well-coordinated and well-designed disinformation campaigns against our citizens or happening in our information space. The action which the digital platforms now have to take is invaluable, because it’s about hundreds of millions of euro, which they have to invest in taking care of the content in the sense of especially fact-checking. So, if you count all that – what we are doing, what we pushed the platforms to do, what the Member States are doing, what the civil society is doing, through the EDMO structures – I think that we speak about very big resources, which are increasing over time, because it has to correlate with the increased pressure from Russia, which we see every year.",-,2024-03-12,"14.

Cristian-Silviu Buşoi,"Madam President, dear Commissioner Hoekstra, dear colleagues, indeed, the European Climate Risk Assessment identifies policy priorities for climate change adaptation and for climate-sensitive sectors. It shows also that societal preparedness is insufficient as policy implementation, and is lagging behind the rapid increase in climate risk levels versus adaptation policy development. We have all witnessed in this mandate the shift towards addressing climate change. We have elaborated the Green Deal Fit for 55 package. You saw a strong commitment of the European Parliament to do our part. We have the 2030 target and our common objective to reach climate neutrality. We even today voted the last part of Fit for 55. But sometimes we are too euphoric and sometimes too dogmatic. We need to understand that to reach these targets and maintain support from citizens, we need to work, and we need adaptation policies – ones that take into account the reality of the Union, that take into account the underdeveloped regions that are still reliant on some energy sources, to take into account that we need to be resilient in the face of health crises or financial crises. We need to talk about adaptation policies that protect people and increase our competitiveness. This is the moment that we need to start to discuss how to turn Green Deal closer to people, in the benefit of people, for a prosperous and resilient Union. And here competitiveness is key. That’s why I believe that we need an industrial deal that will complement the Green Deal. I am happy to see Commissioner Hoekstra being not only determined to fight climate change, reach our strategic targets, but also understand the challenges that we face and the need to build a real Green Deal as a deal for our citizens, but also for industrial sectors, for our autonomy and for our security.",PPE,2024-03-12,"15.

Wopke Hoekstra,"Madam President, Honourable Members. First of all, let me start by extending my thanks for the work done on climate resilience and adaptation in this House, in particular in the years that are behind us. Droughts, heatwaves and floods have been parts of the lives of all generations, certainly also of the generations before us, but what is deeply worrying is that they are increasing both in frequency and in severity. The science is crystal clear; the first ever European Climate Risk Assessment Report, published yesterday, confirms this once more. Climate impacts will continue to get worse before they get better. It is inevitable and it might actually feel overwhelming, as climate impacts are inevitable. But if there is a bit of a silver lining, it is probably that we can and do and should do more in terms of managing it. That is precisely what we are setting out today in this piece of communication. We’re showing how the European Union and its Member States can better manage the growing climate risks that are claiming more and more lives and are challenging our prosperity and economic competitiveness all over Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, what we’re doing today is, if you will, a direction of travel. For the first time, we are presenting an overview of what we view as potential and possible solutions, and we already have many of the instruments available to ensure we become more climate resilient. Even in the best-case scenario, we need to prepare for a temperature rise in Europe of at least three degrees, even if we manage to limit the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees globally. Here’s the good news though – we do have the tools to reduce the damage caused by climate impact. The first tool, and the tool we most talk about, is mitigation, reducing our emissions. Today’s communication is about the other side of the equation; it is about the less discussed part of climate action, which is adaptation. What we’re talking about here is building climate—resilient societies and economies. It seeks to make sure that the European Union and its Member States can maintain people’s livelihoods and businesses’ competitiveness. I’m absolutely convinced we can do this if we work together. It is therefore essential to have clarity on who owns the risks so that we can act effectively, because in this way we can better prepare at EU, national, regional and local levels. With the strong data that we have – and I am sure we will further improve these data in the years to come – we can effectively help our Member States, we can help regional authorities and local communities to plan better. This communication is very much about knowledge. It is about insight; it is about analysis and putting this into practice. Take, for example, the Galileo satellites. In 2025, we will deploy the Galileo Emergency Warning Satellite Service. This will enable us to allow alerts messages to reach directly the populations of areas threatened by disaster. Interestingly enough, this will even be the case when no network is available. Ladies and gentlemen, climate risks impact all sectors,- from natural ecosystems, water and food to health, the economy and clearly also infrastructure. Everything and everyone are affected by climate change, and what we need to do is limit the cost of damages and basically invest smartly. It is better to anticipate risks than to keep responding to disasters. Just to give you a few numbers, the total economic damage of the 2021 floods in Belgium and Germany alone was roughly around EUR 44 billion, and the damage in Slovenia following the floods last year – and we have just recalibrated the number – amounted to 16 % of GDP. And if you find it difficult to calibrate these numbers, let me assure you that this is truly huge. Therefore, the risks should not be underestimated in public budgets. Citizens, businesses, we all gain from building resilience to a changing climate. Of course, this requires public and private investment to manage climate risks. For that, we do need to make sure we explore how to better mobilise the finances available. Ladies and gentlemen, I’ve talked about Europe because that is the continent that the report and our communication focus on. It is a continent, which – as I’ve said before, and this is very worrying – warms faster than any other place across the globe, but climate resilience doesn’t stop at our borders. We’re getting many questions from our friends from abroad, and I want to assure you that we will continue our conversations with our partners to make sure we exchange experiences and seek to help out in every way we can, including on our own continent. Global action to address climate resilience in parallel with reducing emissions is simply vital for future prosperity. Honourable Members, 2023 was once again the hottest year on record. This is a first call, but there will be more in the coming years, and more work needs to be done on resilience at a European, national, regional and local level. We can get prepared. Managing climate risks need to be stepped up and we need to do it right now. It is a duty for all of us simply to make sure that our people and our businesses of today, but also future generations, can prosper in a changing climate.",-,2024-03-12,"15.

Věra Jourová,"Well I think that we are quite awake already. And when you look at the pieces of legislation, indeed, you are right that we use the legal basis of the single market, be it Digital Services Act, be it AI act or the Defence of Democracy package. But at the same time we are doing a lot of other things which seek to make us stronger in the external action field. We have very intense communication with our partners within G7, but also with the African countries, with our partners in Indo-Pacific area. We are strong defenders of our system. We have had to defend strongly our system and democracy as the well-functioning method of governance. In COVID time you remember the big attack from China spreading the information in the EU that democracy cannot solve a problem like COVID. And you saw that we managed together, in unity. So we have the external action, we have a lot of funding, which supports our civil society, also humanitarian aid abroad. I could speak about all the things which we do to be more resilient in the economic sphere – definition of the critical infrastructure, critical raw materials, being more assertive in our trade; there are many different things which altogether should make us stronger. But at the same time, the legislation we speak about, which you say we should not base it only on the single market, it seeks to make us stronger inside of Europe. And I insist on the conviction that this legislation, when it comes into force, will make us stronger. And, as to the last question, I would like to ask the audience, because we didn’t speak about our citizens and how difficult for them it is to sort out what to believe and what not. I think that we should all be aware that not everything we read online or in the social media is worth believing, and that in the future we will have to do more to increase the critical thinking and media literacy and understanding of what’s going on. So this is the invitation, rather than mentoring: we will all have to do something to be more resilient, especially against the foreign interference and disinformation.",-,2024-03-12,"14.

Věra Jourová,"Thank you very much, Mr Castaldo. Well, I have nothing else to say, or I agree with you that we live in the times when some political forces simply abuse the uncertainty and fear of the society, and they sometimes do not hesitate to fly on the Russian propaganda. This is the reality in many, many Member States. I would like to say that we will not help it, or change or improve the situation by lamenting that they are abusing the information space for Russian propaganda. We should ourselves be able to explain to citizens what’s going on, and to also explain why we need to support Ukraine. That’s why what you mentioned, the unity of the Member States, is absolutely key, because for the prime ministers and for the ministers, for the national leaders, it might be more and more difficult to support Ukraine because the society is under permanent pressure from the Russian propaganda, which wants them to stop the support. On the transparency register, well, this is a very important piece of work. We have it for the European institutions. I have to say that for me it was never a problem to register those who I speak to, the visitors, those who try to convince me to do this or that, and I even found it as a kind of my protection, because when you look at sometimes very demanding pieces of work and our decisions which influence big money and big things in reality, I think that we also need to say yes, we have been lobbied by these entities, but at the end we decided like that. So I always was a big promoter to see the transparency registers also at the level of the Member States, because it’s not only fair that we disclose who we speak to and what we do and on which basis, but it’s also a good source of our own protection.",-,2024-03-12,"14.

Věra Jourová,"Yes, I agree with you that this is a serious combination of different, very dangerous things which are happening on our territory. On the army of bots, I think that we make very clear also in the AI Act – and in many different things we are doing – that the artificial intelligence bots, the robots, they do not have the freedom of speech. It’s here for the human beings. And that’s why I always speak to the digital platforms and to those who are running the information space that they should approach it like that. Because if the human beings will be attacked by the army of bots and robots, we will not have any chance. And especially when these AI products will be tasked to spread disinformation. This is what I call disinformation on steroids. That’s why we have to protect the information space, especially before the elections, against this phenomenon. And that’s why I am really glad that digital operators are taking it seriously. On the spies, we are, of course, following the situation in our Member States. However, here I have to say that this is for the Member States to react on it because it falls under the national security rank. In some Member States, they are equipped in the criminal laws to address the spying as the criminal offence. In some of the other Member States, they are more tolerant, but I regret to say that this is for the Member States to take it seriously and to address it in their national legislation and in the proper action. Coming back to what you said at the beginning, I also have to say that Russia is winning the information war in Africa, in South America and in the Middle East, and that we have to accelerate our counteraction to also distribute our way of thinking, our narrative, and our vision of the world, because this is serious.",-,2024-03-12,"14.

Věra Jourová,"Yes, Mr López Aguilar, this is again very relevant question. We don’t have many certain things in current life. One of them is climate change. And then the second thing I would mention, the almost absolute certainty, is that there will be foreign interference into our electoral campaigns, stronger or weaker per member state. Russia especially is the master in analysing where to attack which narratives through which allies, domestic proxies – I would even say useful idiots because they have very good mapping of the situation, and they know very well where it is effective or efficient to attack through which means. As for the sanctions, we have to build it on our current legal framework. So the sanctions vis-à-vis or covering the foreign actors, yes, we can add them on the sanctions list in case we have sufficient evidence that they were the originators, the producers of the concrete campaigns. As for the sanctioning of the domestic proxies, the citizens or the entities who belong to European society, who am I to tell you? You are a lawyer, so you know very well how we can or cannot sanction the distributors of disinformation. Disinformation is mainly covered by the freedom of speech. Here I have to differentiate between hate speech, terrorism, extremism, which is a manifestly clear kind of illegal content. But disinformation requires more analysis. So disinformation, which has the potential to do harm in the society, to do harm to security, or integrity of elections, maybe, in some Member States, can be sanctioned. But again, it’s for the Member States’ authorities to apply the laws which they have in their legal framework. But the sanctionability of the amplification of the disinformation in the EU exists, and in my view should be applied.",-,2024-03-12,"14.

Věra Jourová,"Yes, it’s a specific question. It doesn’t cover the whole EU. You predicted yourself my answer that it falls under the competence of the EU Member States. But, indeed, we discuss with the electoral network very intensively how the campaign should look, in the sense of phasing of rules, of stay periods maybe. And all the discussions we had with the electoral network, but also with the experts on political marketing, tried to convince me that, in fact, political advertising and political marketing with access to digital platforms and social media is ongoing all the time, till the last minute before the elections. So we are discussing whether it makes sense to create some special rules for the last days before the elections, but it’s a decision for the Member States. I am more involved now in discussing with the digital platforms the need to protect, let’s say, the last 10 days before the elections against deepfakes and AI production. Because there might be some last-minute – I will say a military word – shrapnel or some well-targeted weapon thrown into the information space, onto social media, which might be amplified by artificial intelligence and which will really flood our information space with some, as I said, well-targeted kind of disinformation. For me, it’s important that the big platforms, except X, committed to either label such production or remove especially deep fakes, which might have the power to radically mislead the citizens and change their voting preferences. So we are discussing best practices, the methods they use in some Member States.

Barry Andrews,"Commissioner, I have a very specific question about media blackouts in the immediate 24 hours before elections. I think you will say that this is a matter for Member States, that it’s a national competence – and that’s probably correct. Nevertheless, I would like to hear what the Commission has to say about the vacuum that is created by the 24-hour media blackouts, the vulnerability that it creates for our democracies, where there is a ban on public discussion in the media about the election that is going to take place within 24 hours. And of course, as we heard in the last debate, artificial intelligence has the capacity to really supercharge this kind of disinformation in the 24 hours before an election. It’s much harder to detect. It’s in the hands of many, many people. And we have seen examples of it: both in 2017, with the famous ‘Macron leaks’ period, and also in 2020 in the US election.

Věra Jourová,"I will have three comments. First of all, with every new sanctions list, we have new names there. And new names mean the people who might have their properties and their money in the EU, which has to be frozen, and the proceeds of such frozen properties and money could be partly used for the reconstruction of Russia. So first of all I want to say that we have to be very precise in addressing this problem by legal means, which is sanctioning the people, the oligarchs – if you want to use this word – and to be precise in blocking their properties and their proceeds. As for the representatives of this House, if I understood well, I think that it is absolutely key that we achieve, as much as possible, transparency in how we work. And here comes the transparency register, which registers those who want to lobby us. You know there is huge lobbying around many, many pieces of legislation and many, many political actions which we are taking. So as for transparency, I believe that in the next mandate the Commission, Parliament and the Council should look at what other transparency register is still fit for purpose, and maybe also take a lesson from some cases from the past, when we saw Russian entities actively lobbying us who are involved in the legislative process. And also I have to mention the ethics body which we are now trying to establish, because also here there will be a very strong call on transparency, and on the registration of gifts and travels and so on. I think that this is very important. Last comment: I know I am beyond time, but I really think that achieving the adoption of the defence of democracy package and register of contracts with third countries will help, because we need to know who does what for whose money.",-,2024-03-12,"14.

Věra Jourová,"I am afraid it is a very relevant question, but maybe not under the topic of foreign interference and disinformation. I want to say that with every new sanction package, we are addressing more and more sectors, which is compelling, which is pushing European businesses to stop the business they make in Russia. And the problem is not only that, maybe there might be more companies or more sectors affected, but the avoidance or evasion or trying to avoid the sanctions by different means, also through the export through third countries, not directly through Russia. And this is exactly what we wanted to address by the legislation, which seeks to introduce sanctions for avoiding the sanctions. If I am not mistaken, the legislation is still in the legislative process. So this is in the making. But the story or the saga of sanctions has not finished. And we will have to react to new findings and new situations. You mentioned that this is legal business. Well, the legal business is still so until the moment when the democratic institutions declare it illegal. And so this is happening over time. Also, our Member States are acting in this field, but we cannot just over overnight say that the legal business has to be stopped.

The bride is there at the altar waiting for a groom who doesn’t show up, but who sends a message that he won’t come unless the flowers are taken away. So the flowers are removed and the bride waits. But then there’s a more hostile message, and that message is that the groom also doesn’t like the bride’s dress, and she must change it or else he definitely won’t come. So, if this were a fairy tale, the bride would walk away from the altar now, because of gross violations of trust and of respect. But this is not a fairy tale. We are still waiting, and worse, new demands are still being made – and if we haven’t walked away, it’s because this project is too important to let go of. This is a law that was negotiated at length, with every word subject to intense scrutiny – a law with major implications around the world to stop businesses looking away from very real human misery and destruction. I have always called this project too big to fail, because this is about more than responsible business conduct. This is about values, about leadership, and perhaps most of all, humanity. The story that I told you is the harsh reality of European politics at the moment, played out over the heads of the most vulnerable. I’m grateful for the Belgian Presidency’s attendance today. I welcome the Minister. But the institution that you represent has disgraced itself. It has disrespected us and it has undermined European democracy in the process. I won’t ask for excuses today, but what I do want is clarity, accountability and answers on how you expect for us to move on from here. Time is almost up. The bride is still waiting at the altar.

Věra Jourová,"Maybe I will surprise you, but for me, left or right, conservative or liberals, it’s not the most important thing. For me, what is important is evidence-based truth, the facts, which have to be delivered to the citizens so that they understand our reality, because we see more and more attacks against the reality or understanding of reality. We see politically motivated and produced campaigns full of disinformation. We already see artificial intelligence being used for that. We see many different attempts to deliver to citizens the false picture of what’s happening. So this is my job here, not to protect the left or right, but my job here is to, first of all, protect the freedom of speech, and second, to protect all the channels and all the actions which will result in delivery of the facts to the citizens. And I want to repeat one thing, maybe I already indicated that we work with the principle that opinions are subjective. They belong to each individual and they should be protected. Facts are objective. We should be able to verify them. And then the citizens, when they have the reach to the objective facts, they can make their choice, also in the elections. That is why, again in connection with the elections, we are supporting the fact checking online. Again, no ideology, no left or right, but looking at the facts. And we are also trying to support more the independent media and public service media because they are the ones who should be able to professionally work with the subjects and who should be able to deliver the facts to the people.

Didier Reynders,"Madame la Présidente, Madame la Ministre – chère Hadja –, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, le débat de ce soir est effectivement l’occasion d’aborder l’état d’avancement de la directive sur le devoir de vigilance des entreprises en matière de durabilité. Je suis ravi, évidemment, de l’accord qui a pu être conclu en trilogue en décembre dernier par le Parlement et le Conseil, et je tiens en particulier à remercier la rapporteure, Lara Wolters, les rapporteurs fictifs ainsi que l’ensemble du Parlement pour notre excellente coopération dans ce dossier. Cependant, je ne peux que regretter que, à ce stade, cette directive n’ait pas encore été approuvée au Conseil. Je tiens à louer les efforts de la présidence du Conseil en vue de trouver des solutions qui pourraient bénéficier du soutien de la majorité nécessaire. Mon objectif est clairement de voir cette directive adoptée durant cette législature. Pour ce faire, je soutiens la recherche de solutions flexibles. This directive aims to contribute to the sustainability transition. It will allow us to set a level playing field in the single market. Two Member States already have a corporate due diligence legislation, and several others are discussing plans to introduce new rules. Fragmentation should be avoided to the benefit of European companies as well as of all trading partners. At an international level, we see standards being set to try to ensure the coexistence of economic growth with the respect for human rights, labour rights and the environment. Many companies in the European Union and elsewhere have already integrated due diligence in their business strategies. Building on international standards, this directive would contribute to more resilient supply chains, which is important for the long-term performance of companies. This legislation would bring transparency in companies’ chains of activities and thereby facilitate private investment in sustainable and climate-friendly operations. The directive follows a balanced approach to avoid excessive burdens for companies. It ensures that companies effectively address adverse human rights and environmental impacts in their own operations and in their chains of activities, while promoting closer engagement with partners in global supply chains. It does so in a proportionate manner, as it only applies to companies that have the capacity to implement due diligence, namely to large companies. It takes business concerns into account. Due diligence would be risk-based, allowing to use industry schemes and multi-stakeholder initiatives for its implementation. The directive also provides for accompanying measures to facilitate its implementation, as well as for the use of digital tools and technologies. It is also more SME-friendly than any other existing due diligence legislation. SMEs would not have any direct obligation under the directive. We are aware that SMEs present in value chains of larger companies could be indirectly impacted. Therefore, the directive includes a wide range of measures to support and protect SMEs from disproportionate requests from the large companies covered by the directive. We therefore hope that a final agreement can be reached very soon. The new directive would be a game changer, a major step forward in combating adverse human rights and environmental impacts. This would show once more that the European Union is committed to taking action to achieve the objective of a just, sustainable transition, while supporting the competitiveness of companies in Europe. The Commission stands ready to deploy all efforts to facilitate the final adoption of this legislation. And, I repeat, one of the main goals is to have a horizontal approach for all the companies and a level playing field for all the companies from the EU, but also from abroad at work in the European Union. And one of the goals that I have explained since the beginning of the mandate of this Commission, maybe at the beginning of 2020, is that we will try to avoid fragmentation, to not let companies just in one or two Member States now, with the national legislation, like in France or in Germany, but to be sure that we have a level playing field for all the large companies in the EU or coming from the EU again, or coming from abroad but with a real turnover in the European Union. So thank you for what you are doing to try to find a way to have a final agreement. And thanks again to the Belgian Presidency for the efforts to provide also some flexibility in the text, but with a real ambition to reach the goal that we have in such a proposal of a directive.",-,2024-03-12,17.

Barry Andrews,"Madam President, Commissioner and colleagues, this morning I listened to a presentation on sustainable global supply chains from the SWP, a think tank in Germany, and the German Ministry of Economic Cooperation described its own government’s position on this directive as an embarrassment. At no point did the German Government or my colleagues in the FDP indicate that they intended to kill this directive. Even what is proposed now by the Belgian Presidency would bring just 40 Irish companies within its scope. This is not corporate accountability, frankly. Sustainable global supply chains – of which this directive, alongside the Critical Raw Materials Act, plays a significant part – are critical to the twin transition. Creating secure supply chains and just supply chains must go hand in hand. For me, and in general terms, global supply chains represent the final step of decolonisation. It means empowering our partners in the Global South to add value to their vast natural resources. And this can be reconciled with the need for EU competitiveness, and diversified and resilient supply chains.",Renew,2024-03-12,17.

Mick Wallace,"Madam President, we have a regulation to extend the trade liberalisation measures for Ukraine’s agricultural products in the same session as we have a call to impose sanctions on Russian and Belarusian food and agri-products to the EU. The EU’s grain prices have been primarily depressed by the influx of cheap Ukrainian grain. The EU wants to support Ukraine during the war effort, but the reality is Ukraine’s agri—exporters are offshoring billions of the profits from sales in the EU, while EU farmers see their costs rise due to the war and the self-defeating sanctions, and their income threatened by cheap imports. Grain growers in Ireland are seeing their livelihoods eroded by cheap Ukrainian imports. Why put grain growers in Ireland out of business just to enrich big agri in Ukraine? The EU should stop supporting trade deals that benefit speculators and put an end to profiteering by hedge funds. More sanctions on Russia and Belarus will not solve the problem of our farmers.

I think that it’s also a moral duty now to choose the right side of the conflict, and to be very clear in our position that we stand by the side of those who defend, which means Ukrainians. I hesitate whether to name the political parties which spread the narratives, because I don’t want to spread their fame and create their visibility. But I think that in our Member States, we have political parties in the different parliaments, which started to spread the narrative of Russia that, it’s vice versa, that it’s not Russia, but it’s Ukraine who started the war and that the Ukrainians do not deserve to have any state, and they do not deserve to have sovereignty, they do not deserve to be part of the EU. So, you know very well in each Member State what are what are the parties which are spreading these narratives and I would like to call on the other parties, movements and individuals to have courage and counter this speech because without using especially the digital space for telling the people the facts – I avoided the word truth, truth has always some colour or according to many truth is very individual thing but we have some objective facts which have to be defended.

I respect the diversity of views and the plurality here, but I think it is important also to base it on facts and on this particular draft. And this draft says – and the Commissioner has emphasised it – this draft is written based on a sincere respect for the national traditions of how civil society is designed in each particular country. This is something that I mentioned before. This is not an attempt to substitute national traditions in this area. Coming from Germany, where vereine – associations – are so dear to our hearts, I would be the last one to try to demolish this system. But we give an additional option, and I think that any European deserves this additional option to also incorporate themselves in a European way. Yes, I agree with my colleague from Renew that compulsory signing of European values is an important point and it has been also incorporated into the draft. Mr Breton, who was here before, mentioned a couple of points. We discussed this in the Legal Affairs Committee. Most of these points are besides the matter. The decision-making is not given to the general assembly, but to the board, as in most NGOs and most associations. And yes, Anna, I agree with you wholeheartedly. This is not the last stop in this journey. We will have to continue because, as I said at the beginning, civil society is not just an add-on, it’s the core of our democracy.

We must stop the imports of grain and other Russian and Belarusian food products into the EU market as soon as possible. It’s not a matter of survival for us, but allows Russia and alike to continue war crimes. It’s not about economy, it’s rather about politics.

Ylva Johansson,"Madam President, honourable Members, I will deliver this statement on behalf of Vice-President and High Representative Borrell. Food should never be used as a weapon of war. As part of its war against Ukraine, Russia intentionally has undermined global food security by imposing a naval blockade of Ukrainian ports and by targeting its grain storage and export facilities. This was done at the expense of the most vulnerable of the world. In May 2022, the EU established EU-Ukraine solidarity lanes and developed alternative logistic routes to help Ukraine export its agricultural products. In July 2022, the United Nations and Türkiye brokered the Black Sea Grain initiative. However, Russia continuously undermined it. A year later, it unilaterally withdrew from it, and continues weaponising food. Since last year, Ukraine has been successfully exporting food through the Black Sea corridor after having successfully limited operations of Russia’s navy. Currently, the volumes exported through the corridor almost equal pre-war levels. We are confronted today with a different situation in the agri-food market, against the background of increasing imports to the EU of foodstuffs from Russia. Some Member States have raised the issue of influx of cheap Russian grain. The Commission has been notified of the Latvian decision to adopt an import ban on certain agricultural and feed products from Russia and Belarus, and is still analysing the measure. We are monitoring very closely Russian imports to the EU, including the imports of Russian grain to individual EU Member States. The Commission analyses the flow of agri-food products into and from the EU, and assesses what the impacts of those flows are for our own agricultural markets and farmers, for our customers, as well as for the wider issue of global food security. In particular, the Commission is monitoring closely Russian and Belarusian imports to the EU and would consider any additional measures deemed appropriate to avoid EU grain markets being destabilised by imports from Russia or Belarus. When it comes to sanctions in response to Russia’s war of aggression of Ukraine, the EU has unanimously imposed 13 packages of wide-ranging sanctions against Russia. They successfully weaken Russia’s economy, cut revenue streams and curtail Putin’s ability to wage war. Around 60% of all pre-war imports from Russia into the EU are subject to our sanctions by now – an unprecedented decoupling and use of our economic leverage. However, the EU sanctions on purpose do not target Russia’s trade in agri-food products and fertilisers. This is because sanctions on Russia’s agri-food imports into the EU could cause more harm, notably in the form of higher prices, to importing countries in the global South, in cases where the products are transited or re-exported via the EU, than to the Russian economy. It is also important to note the dimensions here. EU total imports from Russia in 2022 were worth EUR 203 billion, out of which EUR 2.2 billion were actual agri-food imports. So we should keep things in perspective. In other words, the EU sanctions, as they stand intentionally, do not target Russia’s trade in agri-food products. The EU has actively worked to preserve the global flow of agricultural and food products, for example by introducing very targeted derogations from prohibition in the Russia sanctions. This is important to stress here because, from the outset, Russia has engaged in a disinformation campaign accusing the EU of threatening food security in the global South. These lies have had some traction in partner countries, despite us pushing back. It is therefore imperative that the EU continuously counters this narrative and instead highlights what we have done to safeguard global food security. As long as Russia’s illegal war against Ukraine continues, we will continue to isolate Russia internationally and call it out for war crimes and for blatant violations of international humanitarian law, maintain our wide range of support for Ukraine and continue applying sanctions against Russia.",-,2024-03-12,19.

Ylva Johansson,"Madam President, thank you, honourable Members for this frank exchange. I have listened carefully to your critical views and remarks. My colleague, Commissioner Didier Reynders, on behalf of Commissioner Várhelyi, already in his introductory remarks explained why the urgency procedure was needed. Despite the critical views that I hear from you, the Commission remains committed to support Tunisia and its population. The MoU we signed with Tunisia in July last year reinforces the continuous commitment in line with our association agreement, which remains the basis of our bilateral relationship. The signature of the MoU represents an important milestone for our work along five key areas of mutual interest: macroeconomic stability; economy and trade; energy; people-to-people contacts; migration and mobility. And both the EU and Tunisia are committed to its implementation. Nine months down the line, concrete results and actions linked to the MoU have already taken place, including resumption of macroeconomic discussions, the signature of limelight projects in the field of energy and digital, and the approval of new investment in modern schools and support on sustainable food security. On migration, EUR 53 million worth of new contracts are already signed since the MoU, and Tunisia has increased its efforts on anti-smuggling operations, which contribute to a significant reduction in irregular departures towards the EU, but also to increase support to UNHCR and IOM in Tunisia. Looking forward, always in line with MoU priorities, we are working on the organisation of an EU-Tunisia business forum with Tunisia this year and on the renewal of our trade relations. We also cooperate with Tunisia on the signing of a civil aviation transport agreement to make Tunisia a more attractive tourism destination. We will finalise soon a political agreement on energy to foster renewables in Tunisia and to improve the investment conditions in this sector and in clean tech. We are reinforcing our support for Tunisia’s youth through Erasmus+ and Horizon Europe. On migration, we will continue to support Tunisia in its fight against smuggling of humans and border management, while working on legal pathways on protection of migrants and refugees, and on stepping up sustainable voluntary returns from Tunisia to countries of origin. The MoU complements our substantial work to support civil society organisations, worth EUR 62 million, including those active in democratic governance and human rights. We are aware of the ongoing discussions at the Tunisian parliament on a new draft law on associations. We hope to continue exchanging with Tunisia on this issue.",-,2024-03-12,18.

Barry Andrews,"Madam President, Commissioner, and colleagues, externalisation is the current popular approach. The UK recently – this week – struck an agreement with Libya. Meanwhile, the UK Foreign Office advises against all travel to Libya. It says if you are in Libya against this advice, you should seek to leave immediately by any practical means. The irony of this paradox is not lost on anybody. This advice, of course, applies only to UK citizens. So what do migrants face in Tunisia? They face racism against black Africans, sexual harassment, police beatings, separation from family members – all comprehensively documented and all comprehensively ignored by the Commission.

And what is the Commission’s response? Reward him with EU funding, putting the final nail in the coffin of Tunisia’s democracy. We raised an objection to this draft decision in December, but the Commission refused to await the democratic process and pushed through anyhow. I am glad that we will have a vote formally to oppose this irresponsible policy. Dear colleagues, I really hope we will adopt a strong resolution and that the Commission will start to take European democracy seriously.

Didier Reynders,"Madam President, Honourable Members, I will try to clarify at different points on the basis of the remarks prepared by my esteemed colleague, Olivér Várhelyi. The Commission remains committed to the continued implementation of the EU—Tunisia Memorandum of Understanding, in close and productive cooperation with Tunisia, with tangible benefits for our shared prosperity, stability and security along the five key pillars of the MoU. Our assistance, in the form of budget support, contributes to the first pillar of the MoU dedicated to macroeconomic stability. It seeks to cooperate with Tunisia to stabilise its macroeconomic situation, improve public finance management and the business and investment climate, with a view to ensuring stable and inclusive growth. Firstly, it follows the negotiations of the budget support programme with Tunisia on the objectives, modalities and conditions, which was concluded on 13 November. Secondly, the adoption of the relevant financing decision by the Commission on 20 December, following the support by the Council and information sharing through various exchanges with the European Parliament before adoption. Thirdly, the signing of the financing agreement with Tunisia, and fourthly, the fulfilment of the general and specific conditions for budget support by Tunisia and the submission of the disbursement request by the end of January. Fifthly, it is followed by the regular assessment by the Commission Service and the External European External Action Service, and sixthly the subsequent disbursement of the EUR 150 million payment on the 1 March. The budget support was adopted in full compliance with the Financial Regulation, the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument Regulation (NDICI) and the EU Budget Support Guidelines. It consultations of the relevant parties, including the Commission Service and the External Action Service, Member States and information and transmission of the official documents to the European Parliament before adoption, despite the urgency procedure that was necessary for adoption in 2023. The respect for and the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms are at the core of our partnership with Tunisia and enshrined in our Association Agreement, which is the overarching legal framework for bilateral relations. Continuous monitoring is being carried out, coupled with our regular political dialogue, including in the context of budget support, in line with the NDICI Regulation. The budget support clearly defined and subsequently monitored the fulfilment of four general and three specific conditions, which were all assessed to be met by the relevant services of the Commission and the External Action Service before disbursement. It followed a single—tranche approach, in line with the agreed MoU commitments and in compliance with the EU Budget Support Guidelines. As mentioned earlier, it was made subject to four general and three additional specific conditions, all monitored and fulfilled in line with Article 236(2) of the Financial Regulation. Cooperation with the European Parliament is an important element of EU cooperation with Tunisia. The issue of access of the EP Delegation to Tunisia has been raised on several occasions, and continues to be raised on every occasion. As before, the Commission stands ready to continue engaging with the European Parliament and discuss the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding. I’ve tried to clarify a lot of the points that you raised in your remarks.",-,2024-03-12,18.

Michael Gahler,"Madam President, colleagues, this oral question relates to a budget support measure to Tunisia amounting to EUR 150 million. What is at the heart of the oral question, as I read it, is not Tunisia as such or relations with that country. This oral question addresses a far more principled issue: the relation between the Commission and this House in its role as budgetary authority. It therefore relates primarily to the procedural flaws in drafting and adopting the implementing decision by the Commission. During the drafting phase of the implementing act, not even informal contacts took place between the Commission and Parliament, as stipulated in paragraph 12 of the agreement between Parliament and Commission on comitology procedures. Furthermore, the Commission adopted the draft implementing decision in an urgent procedure after it learned that we were about to initiate an objection. That could even be interpreted as trying to bypass and thereby undermine this House’s authority. Additionally, the special measure seems legally questionable with regard to provisions in the NDICI-Global Europe Regulation, as well as the Financial Regulation on Conditionality. That should not be taken lightly by this House, as it ultimately is about the ability of Parliament to exercise its right of scrutiny that requires proper, timely and sound information by the Commission to Parliament. So we ask whether the Commission can explain why it was necessary to use an urgent written procedure for this special measure last December, given that the budget support of EUR 150 million was announced as early as 11 June 2023, and that an urgent procedure restricts the exercise of Parliament’s powers of scrutiny. Given that a significant deterioration in fundamental rights constitutes grounds for suspending, reducing or cancelling budget support to partner countries, and given the significant deterioration of such rights in Tunisia since July 2021, can the Commission clarify how it has deemed that Tunisia currently meets the requirements? Given that budget support is subject to the provisions of Article 27(4) of the NDICI-Global Europe Regulation, can the Commission clarify in a written form the definition of conditionality for the said budget support, provide further written details on the procedure and the criteria for assessing whether the conditions are met, as well as on the baseline applied for the assessment of the current state of fundamental rights in Tunisia? Can the Commission clarify why it chose to disburse the budget support in a single tranche, thus not permitting a gradual disbursement based on concrete milestones or steps achieved, as foreseen in Article 236(2) of the Financial Regulation, nor the suspension of further disbursement should a clear erosion of fundamental rights be observed? Lastly, what formal guarantees has the Commission received from the Tunisian authorities since September 2023 that ensure that Parliament will be allowed to visit EU-funded projects in Tunisia and thus exercise its right of oversight and scrutiny in accordance with Article 14 of the Treaty on European Union.",PPE,2024-03-12,18.

Věra Jourová,"I am not sure if I got rightly the question. It is true that Poland was the strongest voice, especially at the beginning, after the invasion of Russia to Ukraine, in helping the rest of Europe to take very strong position on the invasion of Russia to Ukraine. At the same time, we see that now during the war, there is an issue for the farmers of the EU and especially in the countries like Poland and Romania, Slovakia. It is a heavy situation for the farmers because they have to face problems on the market and the problem with the prices. Here we speak about the disinformation and about the manipulation of the facts. I would really like everybody – or everybody who has influence on the public opinion – to be able to say the facts about this, so that, again, the people understand the situation. The protests against the Ukrainian crops and the transport of the Ukrainian wheat and eggs and so on, this is not the protest against the support of Ukraine; it’s in its fight against Russia. But the fact about this is that Ukraine lost markets because of the war. So we wanted to create a safe way for the crops, for the grain, to get to Africa and to some other places, which failed because there were some speculators who kept the crops on the territory of our Member States. This has to be solved. And it cannot be solved by saying something which will just manipulate the facts. The facts are this. And the fact is also that the farmers need help. The Polish farmers, the Slovak farmers, the Romanian farmers, the farmers in the Member States who are affected by that, need help. That’s why we agreed on the compensation. We agreed on some limit for the tariffs. We agreed on many, many different things to ease the situation. I would like us to understand the situation on the basis of the facts.

Tilly Metz,"Madam President, dear colleagues, this new regulation will allow for a more optimal use of the rail tracks, so that we can get more trains on the tracks. Train passengers will benefit from increased punctuality and reliability and it will become easier for shippers to use rail transport for their goods. This is a welcome initiative. It is also clear, to reach the EU modal shift targets, much more has to be done. I am very pleased that we found really solid compromises that improve the Commission’s proposal and I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and of course also their teams. To further strengthen rail capacity, we call on Member States and the Commission to provide stable funding for maintenance, for renewal and construction of rail infrastructure. We also agree that the rail sector should be closely consulted in all planning and management processes. One of our major criticisms was that the sector was intended to design and adopt its own rules, implement them, monitor them and conduct its own performance review. To counter this, we introduce an EU oversight for checks and balances by strengthening regulatory bodies and by an independent performance review body. We also give new tasks to the European Railway Agency to give support, to coordinate digital solutions and to identify obstacles for cross-border rail services.

Virginijus Sinkevičius,"Madam President, honourable Members, the Commission is acutely sensitive to the importance of this law for livestock farming communities. So, the revision represents a major simplification and burden reduction opportunities for farmers. Only the 30% of the largest industrial-scale pig and poultry farms would be in the scope of the revised directive, with the 70% smaller pig and poultry farms, all cattle farms, as well as all organic pig farms out of the scope. The standards for pig- and poultry-rearing will defined in direct cooperation with the sector and farmers will have a long time to adapt, as the requirements will only become applicable between 2030 and 2032. The Commission will report by the end of 2026 to the European Parliament and the Council, including regarding potential measures and imported products. Honourable Members, let me be very clear: farms differ in their size, origins of their emissions, and means and resources to reduce such emissions in comparison to industrial installations. Due to the disparities between the industrial and the agricultural sector, and in light of the report, the Commission will evaluate the interplay with other agricultural legislation and will endeavour to separate the directive into two respective legal instruments. Turning now to the industrial side of the directive, this revision is key to support the green and digital transition of industry, ass the trilogue agreement provides for key flexibilities to test and deploy innovative techniques and for incentives to deploy net-zero technologies. It establishes an electronic permitting system, promotes hydrogen production, and provides a clear governance for key metals, mining and giga battery factories.

Terry Reintke,"Madam President, dear colleagues, first of all, a very warm welcome to you and congratulations. As a former left midfielder, I can only say that actually it was football that has given me the strength and the courage to do what I do today. So I really think that football is not just a type of sport. It is really an enabler to make women strong and to empower women, and this is why it’s so great to have you here today in this Parliament. Colleagues, International Women’s Day should be a celebratory day because we actually have a lot to celebrate. We have more and more women that are smashing glass ceilings. We win battles about the right to abortion. Just last week with the example in France – where with the mobilisation of feminist organisations, with brave women who have made it possible – this important right has been introduced into the constitution. And it’s not only for French people. It is a symbol – especially in times when the right to sexual self-determination is under threat in so many parts of the world – that we all look to France and see how this leadership can make us strong and empower us not to give up and not to go back when it comes to sexual self-determination. We also move forward better protecting women from patriarchal violence. But at the same time, we see that this day is not only for celebration, but mostly for fighting, because it is a day that reminds us what is at stake: our bodies, our freedom, our place in our societies. When we see the attacks on women’s rights all over the world, and especially also in Europe, it is not just a theoretical consideration, when we see polls and election results about majorities in Parliament. A lot of women are literally scared for their own freedom. They are scared for the choices that they can take in the future. Colleagues, I do not want to be part of a generation that, yes, has more rights than the generation of their mothers and grandmothers, but that will have women that follow that will have less rights. So let us stand up to these authoritarian tendencies. Let us stand up to all of those people who are trying to take away rights from women.

Frances Fitzgerald,"Madam President, Commissioners, colleagues, football champions of the world, what a joy and honour to have you here with us today. Strong women, empowered women, at the very top of your game, who got there through grit, determination, tenacity and hard work. Welcome to the European Parliament. We applaud your success. And it is you who will shape the next generation of European sportswomen, as we have seen from your feisty words here today. Well done! We must celebrate, but of course, let’s remember that, unfortunately, harassment and sexual harassment continue to exist in every sphere of life where women take part – in sport, as you experienced last summer, and in politics, as we continue to see here, even in the European Parliament. Regrettably, even as recently as last week, the ramifications of allegations of misconduct in the workplace continue to resonate here – this time within the Greens Group, after the abhorrent allegations against former MEP Gallée. But let’s be clear. The EPP Group does not, will not ever accept that it is okay to harass or sexually harass anyone. A zero policy approach is what we all need here, and we must all be committed to that goal. Over the last five years, the European Parliament has pushed the issue of women’s rights and gender equality to the top of the agenda. Let’s be clear. We have experienced crushingly low moments, with sexual violence used as a weapon of war, women persecuted in Iran and Afghanistan, and the burden of caring responsibilities regressively pushed back onto women during COVID-19. Yet we also experienced some great highs: the ratification of the Istanbul Convention, the adoption of the Pay Transparency Directive, the final approval of the Women on Boards Directive, and soon the adoption of the first-ever EU directive on combating violence against women. Let’s be clear. This has been a good mandate for gender equality. But it didn’t happen by accident. We have had great female leadership across all EU institutions, and in particular from President von der Leyen and President Metsola. Thank you for what you have done. We are very proud of you. But with changing trends in the political landscape, we cannot be complacent. Let me just say, briefly, in recent days there has been much commentary on the referendum results in Ireland. However, let’s not misinterpret these results in Ireland as a backlash against women’s rights. Irish people support equality, women’s rights and care. I’m very proud of what this House has achieved, for Ireland and indeed the whole of Europe, in this mandate.",PPE,2024-03-12,6.

Věra Jourová,"Madam President, honourable Members, dear guests of honour, indeed, you are role models already now and you are a great inspiration for many others, especially young women and girls. I don’t want to spoil the celebration, but I have something serious to speak about, and I want to use this opportunity to tell you something about our new information about maybe not a phenomenon, but I want to speak about violence against women in public space. Last week, I organised a conference on women in public life. In this event, politicians, journalists, human rights defenders and academics shared their experience with online hatred and violence they have to face on an everyday basis. They spoke about threats of being killed or raped, or threats directed at their families. We see women leaving their public functions and we cannot blame them. There is nothing virtual about online violence. Violence is violence and we have to take action against that. It is a real violence that impacts their lives, families and careers. And if we do not act now, even more women will be silenced. They will simply disappear from public life. It would be a disaster for our society, but also for our democracy. To bring about meaningful change as we all need to act, our last week event concluded with six conclusions or six points plan, and I want to share it with you. We all need to send a clear message that violence and hatred against women are unacceptable, that it’s nothing normal, nothing that should be tolerated. Second, Member States must step up and implement their national laws and ensure that perpetrators are punished for their acts. Third, political parties and newsrooms should not only encourage more women to join their ranks, but also actively defend them if necessary. Every time I see the women who have to defend themselves online and nobody else says a word, I think there is something radically wrong. Fourth, online platforms need to step up their efforts with language-specific social media moderation and share their data with researchers. Fifth, we also need to invest much more in education and foster zero tolerance to hatred and violence in our society. And last but not least, the sixth point, we need to collect more data and better analyse them to understand this threat and also to find the best solutions how to tackle this horrible phenomenon. Ladies and gentlemen, honourable Members, I wanted to share with you these outcomes of our discussion last week because many of you will continue in politics, you will be inviting more women to come. So I think that with this invitation should come clear guarantee – we will defend you and we will create conditions for the women to be active in public life, in politics, in journalism and in many other public spaces. We have done our job with the Digital Services Act, the AI Act, the Violence Against Women Directive, but these laws will also have to be brought into life, and it’s also the job for all of us to invest in this effort.",-,2024-03-12,6.

President,"Dear colleagues, dear champions, thank you for joining us to mark International Women’s Day in the European Parliament. Thank you for inspiring young girls and boys across the world, for proving that football is her game, too. Before we begin this ceremony, I would like to invite all of you to turn your attention to the screens to watch a short video clip prepared especially for today’s celebrations. (A video was shown in the Chamber) Dear colleagues, from leading businesses or households to steering nations, from breaking barriers in the boardroom to blazing trails in sports, women have changed the world. That is why we must continue to work harder to level the playing field and to make women’s contributions more visible; to ensure that every little girl and every little boy has role models to aspire to. And to do this, it is my pleasure to welcome to the European Parliament world champions Ivana Andrés and Alba Redondo, on behalf of the Spanish football team that won the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup and, only a few days ago, the first Women’s Nations League. Welcome! (Applause) Bienvenidas, Ivana, Alba, we have seen you and your teammates shattering stereotypes, we have seen you reaching your goals – and scoring quite a lot of them, too! Your victory is a reminder that gender cannot and will not hinder the road to success – that hard work, ambition and determination are qualities that overcome all limitations. We know that this does not come easy. In sports, inequality persists – not least when it comes to media coverage, sponsorship opportunities and pay. More broadly, I think of the women who, despite all their best efforts, are still struggling every day to reach their full potential. This is a systemic problem and one that the European Parliament is working hard – day in, day out – to uproot. Everyone has a role to play here. It is up to each one of us to facilitate a paradigm shift in thinking and in working. To foster policies that will eliminate gender discrimination; to make it easier for women; to remove the unfair barriers that remain. That is why International Women’s Day is so important – as a day to celebrate women’s achievements, but also as a reminder of the remaining work that still needs to be done. And I am so proud that this House is a global leader on these issues and will remain a force for true equality. Thank you. (Applause)",-,2024-03-12,6.

Věra Jourová,"Mr President, honourable Members, I want to thank you for this exchange. I have listened very carefully to your interventions, and many of you were regretting that too many people continue to be subjected to violence against women and harassment. So I want to say clearly that I very much welcome Parliament’s clear determination to engage against violence and also to inspire the Member States after we joined the convention, that they will also ratify. But let me add a few comments about the substance, because, of course, the accession to the convention, it is a legal step and this is what we discussed here but at the same time we discuss about a very, very serious problem. We have quite a numerous audience here, so our citizens were listening and heard that 1 in 3 women report that they have been, in the last five years, targets of violence and very often sexually motivated violence. 1 in 3 – look at us, this is the statistics, which also covers ourselves. I remember when we got these figures, it was sometime in the previous mandate. in 2017 maybe. in 3 was a shocking result of the survey. And we had in this room a lot of women sitting, listening, speaking, and I asked them, ladies, 1 in 3, could you please stand up you who have experienced that? I was the only one. You stood up, you remember that? As a consequence, I had to repeatedly answer ‘what happened to you?’. And I felt it was a stigma to openly speak about that. It was something of a mark of shame. So I want to give a message today not only to all the women, but everybody who can be the victim of violence in the workplace, including the people belonging to minorities – it was mentioned here several times. Please don’t be passive. Don’t let this happen to you. Because this convention and the laws which will come at the Member State level, they have the purpose to protect you. But if you will not be aware that the law protects you, you will probably suffer from this behaviour and from violent attacks and you will not have proper protection. So please don’t be passive. The convention and the laws will enable you to report on the cases of violence. And I would like to wish, especially the young generation, which is now leaving, that you will have better conditions at the workplace because it’s absolutely essential that we are safe at work.",-,2024-03-12,"5.

Marc Angel,"Mr President, dear Commission Vice-President, dear colleagues, today, in 2024, we are still far away from a Union of equality, far from ending the patriarchal architecture of our society. One in three women in the European Union have experienced a form of physical and/or sexual violence. And while the European Union has delivered progressive legislation over the last years to promote women’s empowerment, such as the Work-Life Balance Directive, the Women on Boards Directive, the Pay Transparency and Gender-Based Violence Directives, much still needs to be done. For example, one third of the women who have faced sexual harassment in the European Union have experienced it at work. The ILO Convention No 190 is the first international treaty to recognise the right of everyone to a world of work free from violence and harassment, including gender-based violence. It sets the obligation to respect, to promote and to realise this right, as well as minimum standards for tackling harassment and violence, to realise a healthy, safe and equal work environment for all. We are at the crossroads when it comes to the Union of equality. Everywhere in Europe, populist and far-right forces attack women’s rights and in order to preserve and strengthen the core values of our Union, we must support the ILO convention by ratifying it in all 27 Member States.

Frances Fitzgerald,"Mr President, Vice-President, Commissioner, colleagues, violence against women can and does happen everywhere, as we know. Often we say that the most dangerous place for a woman to be, surprisingly, can be her own home. Yet her workplace can often be equally as dangerous, with, as my colleague said previously, numerous layers of violence – not just physical, but psychological, sexual and so on. At home, at work, on the street, in the car park or, indeed, on public transport: is there nowhere that women can be safe? What a world! We must be vigilant and change this. Next month, we will vote on the final agreement on the directive on combating violence against women and domestic violence. I am proud to have led that work along with my colleague Evin Incir and look forward to its final adoption. But the directive must be complemented by the ratification of this ILO convention by all EU Member States. I am proud that my own country, Ireland, has ratified the convention and it entered into force last year – actions that will ensure that Irish workplaces are safer for women. However, I am disappointed that it is still only in place in a number of Member States. However, there are signs of hope, with another four countries saying that it will come into force in the coming months. As such, I warmly welcome this invitation from the Council. To the remaining Member States I would say, ratify soon and let us continue our efforts to really make Europe the first continent to eradicate violence against women.",PPE,2024-03-12,"5.

Věra Jourová,"Mr President, honourable Members, the European Union and its Member States played a key role in the adoption of the International Labour Organization Convention No. 190, which is the first international standard addressing violence and harassment in the world of work. The convention’s adoption with broad tripartite support is a milestone towards the creation of a safe and healthy working environment based on dignity and respect for all. Another milestone will be the consent that the Parliament prepares to give, and the Council decision that will follow. The convention ensures a world of work free from violence and harassment. It covers the private and public sector, and includes persons in training or jobseekers. The convention requires the parties to respect, promote and realise the right of everyone to a world of work free from violence and harassment in all sectors, including in the informal economy. It acknowledges the need of identifying the sectors in which workers are at greater risk of exposure to violence and harassment, and of taking appropriate prevention and response measures. The convention also recognises the impact of domestic violence on employment, productivity, and health and safety. Parties to the convention commit to adopt an inclusive, integrated and gender-responsive approach to prevention and elimination of violence and harassment.

Hadja Lahbib,"Mr President, dear Commissioner, dear Member of Parliament, I thank you very much for your feedback, comments and contributions, which will always be rich and enlightening for the discussions that will follow in the Council. It is clear that the international challenges will be at the centre of the efforts and decisions of the next Council. Many, many of you have spoken about the situation in Gaza – it will be at the heart of the debate and, as President von der Leyen mentioned, with notably the establishment of a maritime corridor to deliver humanitarian help and additional contribution of EUR 200 million. But this is certainly not enough. We need an immediate ceasefire and the implementation of the two-state solution, which is the only way for sustainable peace in the region. Regarding the situation in Ukraine, I have heard some of you worrying about our defence investment. Let me be clear: our support to Ukraine is unwavering. The current security situation forces us to invest more in our own defence and to make a bigger contribution to the transatlantic burden sharing. This war is today one of the main threats to peace and stability on our continent and beyond. Europe is our continent, after all, and it is in our own interests and vested interests that we are able to defend it. On the subject of European integration, the Commission’s report on Bosnia-Herzegovina, the proposal to open negotiations for the granting of candidate statehood, will be certainly a very important topic on the agenda. I have heard also the concerns about of farmers – they will be at the centre of the next meeting of the AGRIFISH Council on 26 March. The Commission is currently consulting widely with a view to preparing proposals alimenting the debate. We know that many tools are already available and we will work towards decisive results in this regard. When it comes to the reforms of the European Union, it will be not a formal point of the agenda – that is why I didn’t mention it – but it will be certainly discussed during the enlargement discussions.

Maroš Šefčovič,"Mr President, Madam Minister, honourable Members, I think that today’s debate truly reflects the complexity of today’s world and the situation in Europe. I just would like to reassure all of you that we fully understand your focus on a comprehensive approach to security – I would say security in a wider context, in a wider sense. Many of you, especially Mr Weber, Ms García Pérez, but also Ms Vautmans and Ms Loiseau, referred to the importance of defence and military cooperation. They’ve been calling for working very closely together to support Ukraine, but also to address the tragedy of Gaza. But I also heard very clearly from Mr Marques, Ms Szydło, Mr Nica and Mr Lamberts how important it is for our citizens and for the honourable Members of this House to also address the very important questions linked to food and social security, as well as wider economic security linked to the importance to reduce our dependence not only on fossil energy imports, but also on critical raw materials availability for all our future-oriented industry. In this context, also this afternoon, we are going to present the communication on climate security, where we will go into more detail, providing some answers as to how to deal with the management of climate risk and the devastating consequences of climate change on our lives and especially on our future generations. I would like to thank all of you for your support for our enlargement policies, and for sharing with us the joy about the good news of the progress achieved in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I would like to underline that your words and your interventions are very much respected, and that we will work with all of you to address all these dimensions of security. Ms Neumann was highlighting the importance of our proposal on defence cooperation. I know that also in the Council it was received positively, and I am sure that Madam Minister will elaborate on that in a few moments. But we would also like to send reassuring messages to our farmers across Europe, and reassure Mr Bay that we are working very hard and we put a lot of focus on further simplification of our rules, on reductions of burdens, and we are doing our best to address the situation of today. We are also talking to our farmers about how to address the future of agriculture in the medium and long term. If you allow me, Mr President, I would also like to appreciate all of you who helped us to achieve the very important agreement of the Council on support for the rights of platform workers. And I agree with Mr Marques, who underscored that this is an important milestone in how we address the social challenges linked with the work on this platform, which is more and more widespread and popular with people across the European Union. If you allow me just a few words on economic security, because what we are doing right now – and I’m sure that it will be an effort also for the next political cycle – is exploring the possibility of how to use more widely the so-called principle of competitive sustainability. I believe that sustainable companies which produce products with a low carbon footprint, who treat their workers decently, who are sustainable, deserve to be rewarded for their efforts and not to face unfair competition from cheap alternatives and imports from faraway countries, including China. We just simply have to use public procurement across Europe in a better way, and simply give the boost to those responsible companies – because they are promoting the European social model – and fight the supplies which are coming from the companies which very often use dumping prices. And I think that was very well reflected in the interventions of Mr Nica and Ms Penkova just a few moments ago. If you allow me two last comments. Thank you very much for the convergence of views on how to approach the tragedy in Gaza. I think what was very clear in all your interventions was that the protection of civilians must be ensured at all times and it must be in line with international law. We know that right now to restore an adequate flow of humanitarian aid, what we need is an immediate humanitarian pause that would lead to a sustainable ceasefire and a ceasefire that the people in Gaza need right now. And I think that was very clearly highlighted by Ms Marques, but also Mr López Aguilar, who also underlined the importance of diplomatic efforts and making sure that we would create – as our President was referring to in her introductory remarks – a ray of hope towards the two-state solution. Last point: unity in the European Union. I think this was very elegantly expressed by Ms Hayer and I would like to underline once again that unity is our greatest strength. It’s the most precious currency we have in Europe and we need it more than ever, especially in these challenging times across Europe. If we are united, we can achieve anything and I think that’s the message we have to spread across Europe towards all our people, especially when they will be making their decisions in the upcoming elections to this House, to the European Parliament.",-,2024-03-12,4.

Seán Kelly,"Mr President, at the March Council meeting leaders will discuss the issues facing the agricultural sector and I cannot emphasise enough how important this discussion is. Our farmers had to withstand unprecedented economic challenges over the past four years as the COVID pandemic, energy price hikes, unfair international competition in an increasingly protectionist international environment and spiralling inflation have wreaked havoc over our farmers’ livelihoods. The incoming Parliament and Commission will soon work towards a new MFF. We must stand by our farmers throughout this process, especially in relation to the CAP, and I call on leaders to set it as a key political priority when they meet later this month. The new CAP must have a stronger economic pillar that safeguards the vital direct farm payments that make farming an attractive profession and a way of life once again. Our farmers are the ones that put food on our tables, and we must do everything we can to stand by them, cut out unnecessary administrative red tape and adequately support them financially through the transition to net zero. The last two years have shown us the dangers of being dependent on external sources for our energy supply. We cannot become dependent on external sources for our food. Leaders must make this clear later this month. I want to say, we also need to stand by Ukraine. And I would like to see the phrase ‘Ukraine fatigue’ banished from our lexicon. And finally, in relation to Gaza, we have to work and work and work to get a ceasefire there, and put a stop to Netanyahu’s continuous onslaught on the innocent citizens of Gaza.",PPE,2024-03-12,4.

Luděk Niedermayer,"Mr President, the topics of this Council are closely linked to our security, especially in the broad sense. Support of Ukraine, and more sanctions in Russia, Belarus or the countries supporting Russian war, are a must today for us. Promoting the ability of EU defence by necessary investments on the Member States’ level, and the better cooperation, is another dimension of this issue. Today, as the Czech Republic is celebrating 25 years in NATO, I am grateful that Finland and Sweden are also in. Enlargement is not only essential for the stability and security of the countries in the Western Balkans, but is also part of our security concerns, similarly to our diplomatic efforts and humanitarian support in the Middle East. These all are extremely demanding topics for the EU agenda, but very necessary for securing our security. This time, economy and competitiveness are not in the spotlight of the Council agenda. But they are also very important for our security, stability and prosperity. I hope the Council will be able to get back to these very important issues in the near future, as we really need to achieve the improvement in order to promote the better progress of the EU on this front.",PPE,2024-03-12,4.

Hannah Neumann,"Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, dear colleagues, yes, defence is national responsibility. ‘Responsibility’, the Treaties say, not ‘narcissism’. So why do Member States still compete with each other on the defence market instead of procuring together? Why do they still develop and produce duplicating structures, rather than streamlining the scarce resources? And why the hell is the defence industry in some Member States still exporting ammunition to those first in line and not to those who most need it, namely Ukraine? All of this, dear colleagues, puts the security of European citizens and that of Ukrainians at stake, and we simply can’t afford such national egoism any longer. Last week, the Commission put forward a surprisingly good, I’d say, proposal to fix this mess. It is the European defence industry strategy. There, it invites Member States to produce and procure together and to put the needs of Ukrainians up first. I expect Member States to wholeheartedly accept this invitation next week.

Siegfried Mureşan,"Mr President, dear colleagues, I will say a few words on the enlargement in continuation of what President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen just said. Dear colleagues, the last strategic message which the European Union gave to candidate countries was President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker in 2014, when he told candidate countries that there will be no enlargement over the course of the next five years. That was then a justified position. It was correct and I think it was also needed. But much has changed since, and we need to come together as institutions of the European Union and to give a new message to all candidate countries. And I believe this message needs to be that we are going to support these candidate countries to fulfil the accession criteria. The message needs to be, ‘as soon as the accession criteria is fulfilled, the countries will become members of the European Union’. Of course, they do not fulfil the accession criteria yet, but the message needs to be, ‘we are going to support them and we are going, as European institutions, to engage more actively to support these countries to modernise and to fulfil the accession criteria’. Accession negotiations with these countries is good for candidate countries, but it is also good for the European Union because the accession negotiations are the most effective tool that we have to modernise those countries, to reform those countries, to bring them closer to European standards. And this is not only in the interest of candidate countries, but it is also in our interest, the same for our neighbouring countries. The candidate countries are the same for we within the borders of the European Union also are. And this is why I say more ambition, more engagement from our side, clear criteria and no rebates on the criteria, but as soon as criteria is fulfilled, of course the door should be open and let’s work together as pro-European forces on this.",PPE,2024-03-12,4.

Chris MacManus,"A Uachtaráin, EU leaders will gather in ten days’ time, with no doubt much informal discussion of the next Commission president. President Ursula von der Leyen has been selected to be the EPP candidate. I apologise, President von der Leyen, but when it comes to Ireland, you just don’t get us. That’s why I believe a second term for you would be detrimental to Ireland and the EU. Launching your campaign, you commented that you wish to work with those who are pro-NATO. As a neutral country, what does that mean for us in Ireland? You also say you want an EU defence commissioner. We are in the midst of a cost of living crisis, a climate crisis and yet you prioritise a defence commissioner? President von der Leyen’s agenda does not align with Ireland and the Irish people. We value our independent foreign policy and we don’t want any interference in setting that policy. President von der Leyen, keep your hands off Irish neutrality. A chairde, what we need is a Commission president who is committed to a social Europe that puts citizens to the fore of the decision-making process, respects the sovereignty of countries, not a neoliberal pro-militarisation agenda.

Manfred Weber,"Madam President, Commission President, Council representative, dear colleagues, I first of all want to thank the Commission President for today’s announcements, first of all, on the active help for Gaza, together with our Cypriot friends, and also the announcement that Bosnia-Herzegovina gets the status of really starting the negotiations now. Good news, thank you so much. Today, I want to focus on the perspective of the citizens of Europe and the biggest demand in this moment of time is security in a broader sense. Europe must take its security into its own hands. As Adam Smith wrote, I quote, security is more important than wealth. There can be no successful economy and social security system in an insecure society. That’s why we have to prioritise now security. For us as EPP, we had our congress last week in Bucharest. This is deeply rooted in our DNA. We were shaping NATO of today in the past and, even today, we are leading the way towards NATO in Sweden and Finland. Our member parties, as EPP, were the first to call for NATO membership. Socialists, I have again to say, opposed over decades for joining the NATO in Sweden and Finland. Today, we welcome both of them inside of the family. And we think NATO and EU, together now with a commissioner for defence, a single market for defence, our EPP initiatives, EPP has put this also in our manifesto for the next five years and we will deliver. But, after this, we have to do to do further steps, security in a broader sense. Example one: production security. Europe must become more competitive but also use its competitiveness against Putin. We are the third-largest economy in the world, 10 times in size as Russia’s economies. If we work together, no aggressor stands a chance against our production and innovation capabilities. But, are we really using them? The terrorist debate is damaging, but just as damaging is that we are not ramping up our production. We are simply harming ourselves. Every war-relevant product that is not manufactured in the European Union benefits Putin. We must do more so that Ukraine does not run out of weapons and ammunition. Example two: food security. The first thing Putin interrupted in Ukraine was grain production. Food security is not a luxury, but a vital asset. Farmers must be able to produce affordable and safe food at critical times. In the first year of the war, food prices rose by one-fifth. We were able to counteract this not with bureaucracy, but with reducing the burden on farmers. More grain instead of less helps the free world. The next CIP must place a greater emphasis on its own food security for Europe. Agriculture is a strategic economic sector to make Europe more sovereign. Every farmer contributes to making Europe stronger. Example three: energy security. Energy is not just a commodity. It keeps hospitals open and factories running. It is not without reason that European integration was founded on the defence and on energy. They are two sides of the same coin. They provide security. Example four: raw materials security. Innovation and access to necessary raw materials goes hand in hand. There will not be any innovative Europe if we depend on autocratic regimes to produce our innovation. To be secure, Europe must ensure access to the most important raw materials for technologies of the future. We have to stop being dependent on Russian gas, yes, but now we should not become depending on Chinese lithium. Europe’s security is being defended in Ukraine, but we are creating the conditions for this inside of the European Union. Let us think comprehensively about security for tomorrow. We can do it, so let’s do it.",PPE,2024-03-12,4.

Ursula von der Leyen,"Madam President, dear Roberta, Minister, dear Hadja, honourable Members, indeed we are heading towards a packed European Council, with topics, as you said, from Ukraine to the Middle East, defence to enlargement. I want to focus on two topics today. One is the Middle East and the other one is enlargement. As we speak, a ship is setting sail from Cyprus to northern Gaza. It carries the most basic kind of humanitarian aid, which is also the most needed today: food – plain and simply, food – for a population that faces a humanitarian catastrophe. This maritime corridor is the result of unprecedented international cooperation, under the leadership of President Nikos Christodoulides. We have worked hand in hand not only with Cyprus, but also with the United Arab Emirates, the United States, and the United Kingdom. I was at the port of Larnaca just days ago, to witness the final preparations before the ship’s departure. It is as impressive as it is needed. When fully operational, this maritime corridor could guarantee a sustained, regulated and robust flow of aid to Gaza. This is the first time that a ship is authorised to deliver aid to Gaza since 2005. Finally, it is an additional lifeline for the people of Gaza. The situation on the ground is more dramatic than ever, and it has reached a tipping point. We have all seen the reports of children dying of starvation. This cannot be, and we must do all in our power to stop it. Everybody knows how difficult it is to move aid into and within Gaza. All routes have to be used to reach people in need, and this is where the maritime corridor comes into play. It can crucially help increase the amount of aid effectively reaching people in northern Gaza. The United States will now work to set up a floating port to unload big ships. Until this is ready, we work with smaller ships. The United Arab Emirates and other partners will co-finance the cargo. Cyprus will manage the departures at the port of Larnaca. And we, the European Union, will step up our logistic support on the ground. An EU coordination team is already in Cyprus, and we will finance and coordinate the flow of European goods through this corridor. In parallel, several countries, including some of our Member States, have started to airdrop humanitarian aid from Jordan into Gaza. Today, I can announce that we have activated the EU Civil Protection Mechanism to strengthen our support. I encourage all Member States to contribute with their assets, from parachutes to containers, to allow a stable and meaningful supply of aid to Gaza. This year alone, the European Commission has committed EUR 250 million in aid for Palestinians. But the aid must reach civilians in need, and the delivery on the ground is proving particularly challenging. At the end of February, the World Food Programme was forced to end its operations in the north of the Strip, due to the security situation. The aid is now often self-distributed by the population, and we have all seen the dramatic images. We must ensure the safety of the distribution of aid within Gaza. This makes it even more important to work with those agencies that still have a presence on the ground. And this is the case with UNRWA. We all know in January the serious allegations that were moved against some UNRWA staff. This is why we decided to assess our funding decisions in light of the actions taken by the United Nations and UNRWA in response to those allegations. Since then, the United Nations has carried out an internal investigation, and created an independent review group, led by Catherine Colonna. UNRWA has also agreed to an audit by external experts appointed by the European Union. As a result, we will proceed with the payment of EUR 50 million in support of UNRWA. The next tranches will be released as soon as the agency takes the other steps we have agreed together. All of this with one simple goal: that every euro we invest is spent according to our rules, and reaches Palestinians in need. But in the current circumstances, aid alone will not solve the crisis. Of course, Israel has the right to defend itself, and fight off Hamas. But the protection of civilians must be ensured at all times, in line with international law. And right now, there’s only one way to restore an adequate flow of humanitarian aid: the people of Gaza need an immediate humanitarian pause that would lead to a sustainable ceasefire. And they need it now. Honourable Members, let us keep in mind that the risk of further escalation is real. The situation at Israel’s border with Lebanon continues to be explosive. Iran – that is, Hamas’ patron – has continued to fuel regional tensions – for instance, with its support to Houthi terrorists in Yemen. Just like we know they keep fuelling Russia’s war against Ukraine. Let me add that we are prepared to respond with additional sanctions, in case Iran provides ballistic missiles to Russia, as recently reported. Without a sustainable ceasefire, the contagion of the Gaza war could spread across the region. This is a time to redouble our efforts, together with the Member States. So that the hostages can get home, and the people of Gaza can get not only humanitarian relief, but also a ray of hope, towards a two-state solution. Honourable Members, the second topic I would like to address is enlargement, with a focus on the Western Balkans. In these years, we have shifted gear in our approach to the region. We have realised that it is not enough to just wait for the Western Balkans to move closer to us. It is not enough to say that the door is open. We must also take responsibility and support their path towards our Union in any possible way. This is why we have created our Growth Plan for the Western Balkans. This is why we have opened accession negotiations with Albania and North Macedonia, and this is why we have committed to doing the same with Bosnia and Herzegovina. Today, we, the College, are presenting a report on Bosnia and Herzegovina and the progress. It is a factual analysis of the latest developments, and it draws a very clear picture. Since we granted candidate status, Bosnia and Herzegovina has taken impressive steps forward. More progress has been achieved in just over a year than in a whole decade. First, Bosnia and Herzegovina is now fully aligned with our foreign and security policy, which is crucial in these times of geopolitical turmoil. Second, the country is adopting important laws, such as the prevention of conflict of interest – it had been stalled for seven years, now it is adopted – and the law on anti-money laundering and countering terrorist financing. Third, the management of migration flows continues to improve, with negotiations on a Frontex agreement now ready to begin after the Presidency endorsed the negotiating framework. Fourth, the Ministry of Justice has agreed to include in the domestic criminal records the judgments of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. And fifth, on dialogue and reconciliation, a new peacebuilding steering committee has just become operational. Of course, more progress is necessary to join our Union. But the country is showing that it can deliver on its membership criteria, and on its citizens’ aspirations to be part of our family. The good news comes now. This is the reason that we will decide to recommend to the Council to open accession negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina. The message coming from Bosnia and Herzegovina is clear. So our message must be clear too. The future of Bosnia and Herzegovina lies in our Union. Thank you very much, and long live Europe.",-,2024-03-12,4.

Věra Jourová,"You mentioned that disinformation and the attacks from Russia in information space – indeed, I agree – tries to weaken our society, but also to abuse, in fact, democracy and freedom of speech, which we protect and which we want to continue to defend in the EU. We are in the information war, in fact. What we see is a very concrete effort of Russia to interfere into the elections and to influence the public opinion of European people to convince or push their politicians to stop support for Ukraine. There is a very concrete plan. It’s simple, and Putin is a master in creating different strategies and different narratives for different Member States. Your question was about whether there are some cooperating parties or individuals. Well, in fact, Mr Putin needs a mouthpiece that will speak domestic language. He is using the willing collaborators in each Member State. They are either individuals or some parties or movements which are out of the parliaments. In some Member States, we already see parliamentary parties, and unfortunately, we also see some parties which are in our Member States’ governments, which now do not hesitate to spread in their country, in their society, the pro-Kremlin narratives. And so this is happening through the intermediaries, and so it means that we cannot just blame Russia, but we also have to have a very strong discussion with those who obviously stand on the side of the aggressor.",-,2024-03-12,"14.

Deirdre Clune,"Mr President, thank you, Commissioner, and thank you to our rapporteurs and all the teams that brought us to this point. The final adoption of the Artificial Intelligence Act today is a historic moment. This landmark legislation is a significant step forward in our commitment to responsible digital leadership and creating an ethical future for artificial intelligence in Europe. It provides a robust regulatory framework, promoting trust and transparency in AI systems, establishing clear rules for deployment and for use and development. We are fostering accountability and responsibility across the sectors and along our value chains, and this ensures that AI technologies serve the best interests of our citizens. Crucially, this legislation upholds fundamental rights in the digital age, with strong requirements for fairness, accountability and non-discrimination. We safeguard against unfair biases and injustices that may arise from unchecked AI systems. We can – and we will – unlock the potential of AI in healthcare, climate solutions and for economic productivity, but we also set clear guardrails, a ban on social scoring, discriminatory algorithms and manipulative techniques, and this ensures AI serves humanity and not the other way around. In addition, this act will encourage innovation and competitiveness by providing legal certainty and a level playing field, and we create an environment that is conducive to breakthroughs in AI technology, positioning Europe in this way at the forefront of global innovation. So this is not the last post; the AI Act is the foundation. And now comes the crucial task of implementation and increasing international cooperation. And that is the establishment of the AI area. We welcome that, Commissioner, and we look forward to continuing our engagement with our international partners to ensure that we have a global response to artificial intelligence.",PPE,2024-03-12,12.

Věra Jourová,"Thank you, Ms Loiseau, well, I agree with you that Europe needs to defend itself better. But I want to also mention what we hear from, for instance, United States, they will also have to do more to protect their electoral processes. I don’t want to intrude into that, but I know that they are watching what the European Union is doing. I mentioned some of the pieces of legislation which are based on the single market, and I will mention another one which also has the legal basis in the article on the single market – Article 114 – and it’s the interest representation, and this is under the defence of democracy package, because we are convinced that if there are some contracts between third country governments and European entities or entities operating on the European market we should know about that. So our proposed directive seeks to achieve as big as possible transparency on these contracts and on the purpose of these contracts. This is mainly lobbying or organising events and influencing the political decision-making in our Member States. Transparency is key, and I think that we have to make progress here. You ask a concrete question about where we are in the Council. We had, I think, two debates. The last one was in the General Affairs Council, where this file belongs to. There were three kinds of reactions: most of the Member States said, ‘Yes, this is useful, let’s work on it’; part of the Member States said, ‘We already have the register, which shows the contracts and the purpose of such contracts, so Europe, don’t touch it, we have our own system and we don’t want this to be decreased’; and then the third group of Member States, where there was only one Member State, we heard that this is something we should not do.

Věra Jourová,"I will not surprise you. I have to say that all elections matter. Of course, now with the upcoming European elections, we are focusing on them. But also, we have many national, regional and local elections. And in all of these elections, the citizens expect politicians to be transparent, to give them a realistic plan in the campaign and that they will not use dirty methods – if I may say it in such a, maybe too strong, way. We see in fact, three main risks: cyberattacks, foreign interference, which you mentioned, and digital manipulation or hidden manipulation, including disinformation. We addressed some of the risks already vis-à-vis Russia in the first sanctions package. So you may remember that it was a novelty in the EU, but we put on the sanctions list, so-called ‘Russian media’ – I say ‘so-called’ because they were nothing else than the Russian military arsenal. And there were some other so-called ‘media’ in the later packages. At the same time, you ask about the legislation. We have now the Digital Services Act in combination with the Code of Practice on Disinformation. It has the power, if fully implemented and enforced, to decrease the impact of disinformation, including disinformation produced abroad. You ask about the percentage of the impact. I cannot tell you. It differs state by state. And the average figure for Europe will not say anything. I have to say that our foreign adversaries, they have a special strategy for each Member State. Here, of course, Russia has to be mentioned at the first place. But also, we have Chinese and Iran and other activities which are influencing or trying to meddle into our electoral processes – nothing to be neglected or underestimated, because we can see that if the failure appears in one Member State, then it has impact on the whole EU.

Věra Jourová,"Thank you for organising this debate, because this is very topical, and I want to thank also for very strong support from INGE and ING2 Committees. Now to the question. Well, indeed, also the data which we collect from different sources show that more and more citizens in the EU Member States are announcing the feeling that democracy does not work for them and that they do not trust the democratic process. You asked about the solution. I would name three things. First of all, we organised at the European level the national network for elections, where we discuss, among other things, how to organise free and fair elections. So the process, the technical means. Also, how to guarantee that the citizens will get sufficient, clear and early information about where they can cast their vote, and how they get the additional information in case they need it – for instance, the people with different handicaps, who were a little bit abandoned in the last elections. We now focus on that. The third thing is the communication we have with the European political parties. Through them, with national political parties, we want the elections to be free and fair, in the sense of free from manipulation. That’s why I asked the political parties to resist the temptation to use methods like deepfakes, and at the same time to use their communication to encourage the voters’ activity and action. As for the deepfakes, we just had a discussion here about AI. We also required some action from the digital platforms and from the technologies, and they also committed – the biggest ones, except Twitter or X – they committed to act against the deepfakes and hidden manipulation before the elections. The campaign has to be very transparent and free of manipulation.",-,2024-03-12,"14.

Miapetra Kumpula-Natri,"The transformative impact of AI on society and the economy are beginning to emerge. Europe needs to build a society that respects fundamental rights and individual freedoms, and still can compete with the US and China in terms of technological advancement and economic competition. The AI Act is an important step towards this direction. As Vice-Chair of the AIDA Committee and as the S&D Group’s shadow rapporteur in the opinion of ITRE Committee I am delighted it contains several important obligations to mitigate the risks AI may cause for our societies and citizens such as fundamental right assessments. The AI Act creates a framework for ethical and trustworthy AI development and deployment. It includes important obligations to safeguard citizens’ rights and creates balance for security and innovation. When we started to work with the legislation in the AIDA committee people were telling AI cannot be regulated, it’s too complicated. The EU has broken this taboo. However, regulating AI is not enough. In addition we need to enhance and support European AI innovation ecosystems, and ensure development of competitive and ethical European language models.

Dragoş Tudorache,"Mr President, many thanks, dear colleagues, for this debate – a debate that raised the points that have accompanied us during our work, during the negotiations for the past three years. Have we found the right balance between protection and innovation? Do we have the right safeguards for citizens against the risks that technology can bring or against the potential abuses by governments or by bad actors? Have we secured this legislation enough for the future to cater for the incredible speed with which it evolves? To all of these questions, I have one answer: absolutely, yes. And we should feel proud that the answer is ‘yes’, because of the work that this House has done. We introduced enablers for business and innovation.

Seán Kelly,"Mr President, (start of speech off mic) ... on behalf of those who sat here during the entire debate in the hope of catching the eye, I want to say I am not happy with the way you handled it.

You said you were going to be lenient with them because you were lenient with the Commissioner. Now you decide, at the end, that you’re only going to take five, which in itself is disproportionate, because if you take my group, my group – the EPP – are five or six times bigger than the smaller group, so I think you really need to reflect on, number one, the way you deal with the debate, and secondly, the way you decide in the end how you’re going to allot catch-the-eye.

In general, our lives are safer today than ever in the past, and I am sure AI will make them safer tomorrow.

You have to steer it in a direction that benefits, not harms, our economy, our society, our humanity. This AI act is our timely attempt to control the future developments before they control us. Yes, this law is weaker than the regulation that we, as this Parliament, have wished. But it is better, much better, than no regulation at all, than an AI Wild West. And in many areas, this law is a pioneer work. Yes, we would have loved to see a complete ban on biometric facial recognition or a comprehensive prohibition of behavioural observation by AI, but the fact that indiscriminate mass surveillance is no more possible, that we have bans like emotion recognition vis-à-vis students and employees, that we introduced fundamental rights assessment, environmental obligations, the regulation of foundational models – all this shows that Europe is a continent that feels the pulse of history, also in the digital age.

Maybe it takes a Catalan to realise, but you have seen a Member State – Spain – spy on us with a much weaker technology – Pegasus – with the indifference of the institutions of the EU. How can we believe that these exceptions are included in good faith? Populism and authoritarianism are on the rise. Western democracies are experiencing an unprecedented regression on human rights.

Kim Van Sparrentak,"Mr President, colleagues, let’s first state what this is: this vote is a revolutionary step, and from left to right, we bridged our differences – and there were some – and we fought together an unprecedented lobby against rules. Today, the EU is taking the lead worldwide with binding rules for artificial intelligence, including for ChatGPT. And with clear rules on how to design and use AI, we’re putting people and society first, and I’m particularly proud that we already managed to learn from mistakes that were made with the use of AI before. We will make sure nobody’s ever classified as a criminal or fraudster purely based on a calculation again. We will make sure people always get an answer to questions they have about certain decisions made by governments, instead of facing a computer that says ‘no’ and leaving people empty-handed. We will make sure a human is always in the loop, so your human rights are protected and you’re not discriminated against. And I’m proud of the clear limits we put to unethical technologies, such as predictive policing, facial recognition in public space, and so-called sexuality recognition. I would have wanted to go even further, with stronger bans closing every loophole, binding environmental standards and mandatory testing for all large language models and image generators instead of only the largest ones. But my fight for this will continue. Let me use my last seconds to once again thank the amazing staff, also from the Commission and the Council, that stayed with us for 38 hours, which was ridiculous and it should not have been that long.

Petar Vitanov,"Mr President, Commissioner, 87 % of the respondents to the Eurobarometer Survey on Digital Rights and Principles say that Europeans should be protected against risky or unethical application of digital technologies including artificial intelligence. We are answering the demand of the people by introducing this legislation – the first comprehensive set of rules about AI systems. We have already said many things about the aspects of this agreement. The co-rapporteurs and the shadows, we all have briefed this room, our groups, our committees many times. This was one of the most publicly documented pieces of EU legislation – the amount of articles and posts on social media was extraordinary, and everyone seems to have a strong opinion of the outcome – and also one of the most lobbied legislation as well. The corporate interests were huge, and I’m proud to say that faced with this enormous pressure, the European Parliament held its ground and fought for its citizens. The EU legislative procedures are too opaque, too confusing, but we are the ones who speak directly, openly to citizens, industry, NGOs. Our meetings are public and well documented. Our positions are clear regardless of which group I’m talking about. It’s the Council who is in debt with its citizens. If there are any shortcomings of this legislation, and there probably are, it’s not because the European Parliament didn’t fight. We secured the ban of certain malicious AI systems. We introduced stricter safeguards on the use of RBI systems. We included foundation models in the scope of the regulation. We fought for more power to individuals when interacting with AI systems.

Věra Jourová,"Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for a very interesting discussion. Most of you confirmed that the EU needs to adopt the Media Freedom Act as soon as possible so that it is enforced and it becomes a reality for journalists as soon as possible. I want to react to several speakers. First of all, there was a question mark over the role of journalists – of course, to inform the citizens, to be our eyes and ears from the battlefields. Unfortunately, we have wars very close to us and journalists are risking their lives to do their job and to give us trustworthy information. And this is the main reaction why I wanted to say it: keep us, the politicians, in power and under control, helping the citizens to understand what we do in politics. I think that this is this is a very key role and I think we want too much from the media. It was already in discussions before in this House, we want so much from the media and we do so little to create workable conditions for them, including elementary safety. So I think by this Media Freedom Act, we are correcting this imbalance of powers, because I think that most of us are aware that the weaker the media, the weaker the democracy. A few comments on Mr David, who is not here anymore, on disinformation. Indeed, we have definitions about disinformation which pose a risk to our democracy, to our elections and to our safety. And if he wants to read another definition of disinformation, he could read some of Putin’s military papers, because this is in Russia’s military doctrine that they will use this information as their weapon against European democracies. So it is comment number one. On the comment of Ms Bocskor – who is not here anymore again, so I’m sorry she didn’t wait for the answer – she interpreted this law or she called it a ‘Brussels censorship law’ or something like that. This law is a threat only to those, mainly on the political scene, who want to turn the media into Kremlin-style propaganda. It is a threat to those who want to use the power of the state, also financial one, to make the media dependent on them. I said at the beginning that by developing this law, we were inspired by real problems in several Member States. Hungary was one of the inspirational sources for us exactly because of these issues. I want to react to Ms Tomc. She said she does not trust me. I regret that, but I want to remind us of the situation when Prime Minister Janša and his ministers were publicly attacking concrete journalists, as if giving the blessing to the society to continue this. If politicians start attacking journalists, this is the example for the country. If politicians call journalists public enemies, this is also a very, very difficult situation for democracy. I would like to remind us of the moment when the Slovenian state agency, the public service Press Agency, had to start crowdfunding to remain alive. Because the state didn’t want to finance it, because the agency was not comfortable for the politicians. So these were my reactions on the Slovenian situation in the media. Now, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to switch into my language because I want to speak Czech about the situation in Slovakia. I will be short. Pane předsedající, ráda bych řekla k situaci na Slovensku, že sledujeme zejména situaci médií a novinářů. Připomínám, že je to země, kde došlo k vraždě Jána Kuciaka právě proto, že byl velmi schopným novinářem, který dokázal pracovat s veřejnými informačními zdroji a pokrýval korupční kauzy spojené i s politickou sférou. Dnes tady hovoříme o zákoně o svobodě médií, a když pomyslím na situaci a vývoj na Slovensku, tak se mi chce říci, že včera bylo pozdě. Takže my sledujeme situaci. Nové zprávy o tom, že se má změnit fungování veřejnoprávní televize, jsou jednou z těch věcí, které – myslím si – zaslouží naši pozornost, nejenom Komise, ale každého, kdo rozumí tomu, že v každé zemi by měla být opravdu silná média veřejné služby a ne média, která budou sloužit jako hlásné trouby strany a vlády.",-,2024-03-12,10.

But I would like to make one remark, because the effectiveness of this directive is going to depend entirely on its enforcement. And here we see a weak point – because free media are under pressure, not so much from external forces, but by governments – by governments because that is what the media do: they scrutinise governments. And there are lots of governments inside the European Union who do not like to be scrutinised. Therefore I would like to really, really ask the Commission for a very strict enforcement and not enforcement on the basis of, ‘oh, but, you know, it is for the national authorities to apply this’, because they will be the perpetrators.

Věra Jourová,"Mr President, congratulations on your birthday, first of all, honourable Members, we are discussing today and you are going to vote on the first ever EU law to protect media freedom. By doing that, we send a very clear message to the journalists – something like: your work is essential for democracy and it is the duty of democracies to protect you – and also the strong message to those who want to weaken democracy: we will not allow you to do so. The Media Freedom Act was born here in this place. It was called for by the European Parliament and it was also announced here. You asked the Commission to be innovative and act – and we did it. Commissioner Breton and I worked on it together to protect both our values and our single market. The Media Freedom Act addresses very clear problems and attacks against the media, interference by governments in editorial decisions, pressure on public service media, surveillance of journalists, lack of transparency of media ownership and of state advertising or lack of coordination among media regulators. And here I want to react to what Sophie in ‘t Veld just said. I am aware of it. It will require very strict enforcement. We will be watching how the Member States deal with the clear task to establish truly independent enforcement bodies. And I am now travelling country by country. Yesterday, I was in Vienna. I spoke to the future enforcers last week in Rome. The same thing. So I am not underestimating the need to have this enforcement structure well functioning. Because you are right, it might serve against the pressure of the state. That is why it is it is very important to have independent and courageous enforcers. Each article of the Media Freedom Act brings a solution to the problems I just listed. The act goes hand in hand with other pieces of legislation to make our information space healthier and safer. Here I have to mention, first of all, the Digital Services Act, which requires online platforms to fight illegal content, disinformation and also we will have to look into the coexistence of the of the media and artificial intelligence. So we have to read or understand all the new pieces of legislation to understand how we are protecting information space in the EU without any kind of censorship, which is always important for me to mention. I am beyond the time, so I will, at the end, appreciate very highly the incredible work of the rapporteur, Ms Verheyen, and of the rapporteurs of the associated committees, Ms Strugariu and Mr Didier. Thank you very much. Thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs and all the Members who were involved and the members of their staff. It was not an easy way to get here – the law had a lot of opponents, if not enemies, but we joined forces and I think that together we managed to produce or adopt or propose for adoption a very useful and practical and needed piece of legislation to protect the media in the EU.",-,2024-03-12,10.

Mick Wallace,"Mr President, the Commissioner would be very disappointed if I didn’t get to talk. The final draft of the European Media Freedom Act is disappointing, but no surprise given how the EU is hell bent on promoting the defence industry at every opportunity. This legislation could have made a strong statement: that the use of spyware by Member States against journalists would be illegal. Instead, it fudged the issue, and the legislation now refers to the fact that the European Union confirms to respect Member States’ responsibilities with regard to national security. The consequence of this is that the Council’s retention of the national security exemption enables EU governments to continue to deploy spyware against journalists under the guise of national security, outside the protective framework of EU law. This is a backward step at a time when we know that spyware programmes, such as Pegasus and Predator, have been employed by EU governments. Neither should we forget that many of these Israeli companies who make a lot of this stuff test their products on Palestinians under illegal occupation.

Dragoş Tudorache,"Mr President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, it is customary to begin with thanks. I will actually continue where my colleague left it. I want to say, first of all, thank you, Commissioner Breton, and thank you to the Commission as such for the foresight of putting forward this proposal when no one else around the world was actually looking at this option. I also want to thank the shadow rapporteurs for putting the incredible energy and effort that was required from you and your teams to draft those over 3 000 amendments, to streamline them into a coherent mandate, and then negotiate that with the Council. I would thank the Council if they were here, but they are not. And I want to specifically thank Brando Benifei for being such a great colleague and co-rapporteur. So this is it, colleagues. We delivered, the EU delivered. No ifs, no buts, no later. These are the rules we have forever attached to the concept of artificial intelligence, the fundamental values that form the basis of our societies. And with that alone, the act has nudged the future of AI in a human-centric direction, in a direction where humans are in control of the technology and where it – the technology – helps us leverage new discoveries, economic growth, societal progress, and unlock human potential. Much work lies ahead that goes beyond the act itself. AI will push us to rethink the social contract resting at the heart of our democracies, along with our education models, our labour markets, the way we conduct warfare. All this to say that the act is not the end of a journey, but rather the starting point for a new model of governance built around technology. Going back to the act itself, we must now focus our political energy in turning it from the law in the books to the reality on the ground. First, implementation: the rules we have passed in this mandate to govern the digital domain, not just the act, are truly historical, pioneering, but making them all work in harmony with a desired effect and turning Europe into the digital powerhouse of the future will be the test of our lifetime. Second, we need to work with others. The EU now has an AI office to govern the most powerful AI models. The US and the UK have established equivalent structures and many more will follow suit. It is imperative to connect these initiatives into a strategic triangle and then into a network, and that will allow us to stay on top of any unforeseen developments in AI that might require a coordinated response. Third, we need to play on the global scene in accordance with our weight, not just by making the rules, but also by exporting them. We need to put our entire diplomatic and political clout in promoting the European model of AI governance. This is a strategic priority for the next mandate, alongside reducing our strategic dependencies and increasing our resilience – because the future is AI-fuelled and we must continue to shape it. One final thought. We haven’t yet witnessed the full power of AI. The existing capabilities have already surpassed anything we could have imagined a decade ago, at speeds we have never thought possible, and this will continue exponentially. For lack of a better term, artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is something we need to prepare for. Any AI possessing an intelligence that is superior to that of a human being will open up infinite possibilities, but at the same time, will raise never before encountered ethical, moral, and yes, even existential questions. We have in the act a first answer to those questions, but we must be prepared to cater our governance for quantum leaps that we know AI could do. I will conclude not as a politician, but as a parent. This regulation makes me feel more confident about the future of my children, and I am humbled to have played a part in shaping it together with you, all those present in this Chamber.",Renew,2024-03-12,12.

That is, if it’s done right. In a way, we close one chapter, but the story continues. What I believe now is important is that we focus on three things. First of all, to provide legal certainty to all stakeholders, including companies. Second of all, to play an active role in ongoing global efforts through the G7 Process, OECD and the UN. And thirdly, to prioritise AI excellence through concrete commitments and investments. I stand before you because I do believe that in Europe we are more than just a referee.

Kadri Simson,"Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for the opportunity to have this exchange ahead of the vote on the recast of EPBD tomorrow. And first of all, I would like to thank all members of the Parliament and especially the rapporteur, Ciarán Cuffe, and shadow rapporteurs, for our constructive cooperation on the file over the last two years. Almost all files in the energy field of the Fit for 55 package have been formally agreed by co-legislators, and together we have adopted strategies on many aspects of the clean energy transition. We have established a framework for entering Europe’s energy sovereignty and competitiveness, and the EPBD is the one missing piece to complete this picture. And tomorrow we will vote on it. And this is an important file for a few different reasons. First, buildings are the single largest energy consumers in Europe. We will not face the decarbonisation and economic challenges and energy supply dependencies if we don’t tackle buildings. And secondly, healthy and sustainable living conditions are completely out of reach for far too many EU citizens and this must change. We need to rethink the way we build and renovate homes, and how we help create communities and vibrant spaces that are accessible and affordable for all Europeans. Honourable Members, I believe that the provisional agreement found on the EPBD presents a good balance between ambition, flexibility and feasibility. If the revised EPBD sets the standard, there will be a positive domino effect. First, in terms of our growth and competitiveness, there will be greater demand for manufacturing of clean technologies, such as heating and cooling solutions made in EU, service providers, technical and financial advisors, and this will create jobs, investments and growth. A substantial number of local jobs will be created in the construction supply industry, a sector which is largely driven by SMEs. Second, the EPBD tackles the root cause of energy poverty and makes energy more affordable in the long term. Today, thanks to new construction methods, materials and products, new buildings consume less than half compared to buildings built before the first EPBD. But these new buildings are not representative in the EU building stock, because 85 % of residential buildings were built before 2010 and will stay until 2050, and 75 % have a poor energy performance. And with a provisional agreement, we have the right measures to boost the energy performance of the worst performing buildings, but without obliging individual homeowners to renovate. In the non-residential sector, minimum energy performance standards will trigger the renovation of the worst performers where it is most cost-efficient. And these renovations will promote more energy efficient, liveable and cohesive housing on a large scale and innovative digitalised and net zero technologies will be harnessed for the best results. New buildings will be zero emission buildings fit for a climate neutral future, and solar installations will become the norm for new buildings. Fundamentally, citizens will not be left alone in their efforts to improve their homes. They can turn to one stop shop for advice on building renovation, and those who plan to carry out renovations in several steps can make use of the newly introduced building renovation passports. Finally, provisions on public and private financing complete the picture to make renovation affordable and feasible. The adjusted rules for Energy Performance Certificates will build trust in the performance of a building, in the impact of renovation works, and simplify access to financing, and the national building renovation plans will build transparent and reliable roadmaps, setting national targets for building renovation and elaborating on policies, investment needs and available resources. Honourable Members, your vote tomorrow on this EPBD file is a critical part of our joint efforts to ensure the clean transition makes a difference in the lives of citizens across the EU. We can fast forward the clean energy transition, sends strong investment signals to our economies, and empower citizens to benefit from energy efficient homes. The Commission counts on you.",-,2024-03-11,15.

Ciarán Cuffe,"Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Simson for her words. But I also want to thank my co-negotiators in the European Council and the European Commission, as well as the Parliament negotiating team, and in particular thanks to Thomas Baynes and Kelly McGlynn from my team and Heike Leberle from the Greens. Commissioner, you said this is a critical part of our joint efforts to combat climate change. I agree, it is a critical part of the ‘Fit for 55’ package. To Seán Kelly: A Sheáin, a chara, ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leat le haghaidh an méid oibre atá déanta agat leis an treoir seo. You mentioned energy security, a crucial issue. You also mentioned the flexibility that the directive will provide and the focus on cost effectiveness and affordability. To Tsvetelina Penkova, you said we need long-term solutions, I agree. You focused on energy poverty – that’s at the heart of this legislation. This law will lift people out of energy poverty. To Morten, you said this will help us stop Russia’s war of aggression. It’s very clear the best way to combat Russia, and the best way to isolate Putin is to insulate homes. To Ladislav, you know that vulnerable householders will be protected as per the requirements of this directive, and that law clearly does not put renovation obligations on people’s homes. Those requirements are only applied to the most wasteful non-residential buildings, such as hospitals and schools. Your colleagues say that it will make people poor and be bad for our children – the contrary is true. This directive will protect renters. It will make sure that they live in less wasteful buildings. It will lower their energy bills, and financial support and social protection have to be put in place. To my colleagues in The Left, I want to reassure you that any renovations that cause hardship for citizens will not go ahead, and it will make sure that funds are prioritised for vulnerable families, and particularly to Marina Mesure from The Left, you made the link between healthy homes and positive health care outcomes. That’s so important. And then finally, to Isabella, you mentioned the diversity on this great continent in climate, but it’s also there in people in opinions and were so much the better for it. You mentioned questions, we are offering answers.

Kadri Simson,"Mr President, honourable Members, I have been listening carefully and thank you for sharing your views. I would like to emphasise once more that steady progress is needed in the building sector to achieve energy security and climate neutrality, driven by a strong European net-zero industry. Europe won’t be able to meet its energy and climate targets, improve energy security, and lift citizens out of energy poverty without improving buildings. With the revised EPBD, we ensure a just and inclusive energy transition. And we address the calls from manufacturers, the construction industry, service providers and homeowners to provide investment certainty. The deal strikes an excellent balance between aims and means to achieve the European Green Deal and REPowerEU objectives. In the Commission view, the revised EPBD is the missing piece of the puzzle to put the building sector on the right track. The ETS extension to buildings and the revised EPBD complement each other. Both pieces of legislation are necessary. By putting a carbon price on heating, the ETS extension on buildings creates economic incentives for enhancing building insulation and a transition towards renewable energy sources. However, we cannot leave citizens alone to navigate an increase of heating prices. We also need to provide an enabling framework for building renovation, and we need regulatory measures which tackle the non-economic barriers to building renovation. The revised EPBD contains both such regulatory measures and the necessary enabling framework. Recent years have seen an unprecedented increase of EU and public funds for building renovation, also for the coming years, and notably through the Recovery and Resilience Facility. And in the future, the Social Climate Fund will provide financial support to building renovations for vulnerable citizens and SMEs to ensure that no one is left behind. Also, some honourable Members have raised concerns over the requirements for recharging infrastructure for e-vehicles. In the Commission’s view, the deal strikes the right balance between the necessary rollout of recharging infrastructure and important flexibility for Member States and building owners. I therefore strongly encourage you to support the revised EPBD at tomorrow’s vote.",-,2024-03-11,15.

Clare Daly,"Mr President, I’m very disappointed that despite the rapporteur’s best intentions and efforts to keep this file ambitious, his work was undercut by his Irish Government colleagues’ Group, the EPP. This was a chance to do many things at once: to use climate money effectively, while also addressing social inequality. But with Member States marking their own homework, and given that the Council had already filleted it, it’s unlikely to deliver in that regard – and particularly, as colleagues have pointed out, the lack of clear commitment to public money being used – the type of public money necessary to make this transition. In 2019, this Union was handed an historic mandate for climate action by citizens, including, particularly, young people, in light of the very urgent threat to civilisation. Five years down the road, the planet is burning, but one file after another is retreating into reaction. The planet and humanity, frankly, don’t have time for this.

Cristian-Silviu Buşoi,"Mr President, dear Commissioner, dear colleagues, the review of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is an essential element of the renovation wave and also a crucial part of the Fit for 55 package. I would like to congratulate, first, the European Commission, but also the European Parliament team, for concluding this file before the end of the mandate and for achieving what I will call a good result. I really believe that the result is taking into account local circumstances, and also that the diversity of buildings and building stocks in each Member State. Of course, the cost will be significant. This will raise concerns in many Member States, including my country, Romania. But I am afraid we do not have another option if we want to reach our targets. And the final compromise is also more balanced than the initial proposal of the European Commission. Clearly we with this legislation we have changes to the definitions of energy performance standards, revisions to national building renovation plans. But this will give also Member States the flexibility they need to use the minimum energy performance standards, voluntary to reach their own national targets. Though the new building standards will be more stringent and the energy efficiency demand will be higher, it is important that they will not be set to common thresholds at European level, but at national level according to Member States cost optimally calculations. Renovation of buildings means also decarbonisation of heating and cooling, including the district heating and cooling networks. With this legislation, we need to phase out fossil fuels in heating and cooling with a view to a complete phase out of fossil-fuel boilers by 2040, but also this could bring opportunities for some European industries. Romania, my country, is one Member State that still has large regions dependent on fossil fuels and district heating, and I hope that we will manage to find the necessary funds for the investments and use all EU opportunities.",PPE,2024-03-11,15.

Seán Kelly,"A Uachtaráin, Commissioner Simson, a chairde, scaling up the deployment of renewable energy technologies is a vital part of delivering on our climate goals, but it must go hand in hand with maximising the efficiency of our existing building stock – the last missing piece, as the Commissioner just said. In 2022, the same year the energy crisis really began to wreak havoc on our electricity and gas bills, the EU relied on expensive imports for 62.5% of its energy consumption. In Ireland, we spend EUR 1 million every hour on fossil fuel imports. Ending our dependence on external sources for our energy supply is good for the climate, good for Europe’s energy security and critically good for our economy and EU competitiveness, as well as job creation, with the construction sector being the largest generator of jobs per million euros invested. The EPBD will make it easier for people to renovate their homes, ensuring our buildings consume less energy and rely on cheaper and greener renewable sources. For residential buildings it is completely up to each Member State’s government to decide how they will achieve the 16% energy savings across the stock. Member States may decide to use a combination of various measures. As for non-residential buildings, Member States retain a high degree of flexibility when applying exemptions or derogations, such as historical buildings. Importantly, actions from other pieces of legislation will also contribute to the EPBD. After long negotiations, we now have a sensible compromise on the table that appropriately balances increasing the energy performance of buildings on one hand, while ensuring cost effectiveness and affordability on the other. The threat of compulsory renovation that had been hanging over millions of owners and tenants is now off the table. It is vital that the European Parliament passes the EPBD when it votes tomorrow, and I am pleased that my group will be voting in favour. And finally, I would like to thank a great team of co-rapporteurs – it has been a joy to work with them and hopefully our work will bear fruit tomorrow and into the future in ensuring we have energy-efficient buildings across Europe.",PPE,2024-03-11,15.

Mick Wallace,"Mr President, the text of the Green Claims Directive builds on the empowering consumers for the Green Transition Directive, which essentially bans climate neutrality claims for products based on offsets. The Green Claims Directive text we passed at ENVI adds a significant restriction on claims based on offsetting at the level of a trader, not just at the product level. The text now states traders would only be able to use offsets on residual emissions, in line with the Environmental Sustainability Reporting Standards. Both the Empowering Consumers for the Green Transition Directive and the Green Claims Directive show that there is an appetite in the Parliament to tackle offsetting. The next logical step would be to contest climate neutrality as a concept and as the basis for EU climate action, and to work to establish a separate EU carbon removal target.

Ciarán Cuffe,"Mr President, Commissioner Simson, colleagues, tomorrow you will have the opportunity to support lower energy bills, tackling energy poverty and creating thousands of high-quality local jobs across Europe by voting for the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. This law sets a fair and ambitious pathway to a climate-neutral building stock by guaranteeing priority funding for renovations for the people who need it most. Placing those living in Europe’s coldest, dampest homes at the top of the queue and including protections for renters against evictions. This is the just transition in action. No one is left behind. In fact, we are bringing everyone with us and delivering better buildings and a high quality of life for all. This is the European Green Deal. The EPPD places the final piece in the Fit for 55 package of climate laws. Buildings contribute 36 % of Europe’s CO2 emissions and nearly three in four buildings are energy inefficient, so tackling buildings is an essential step to reaching climate neutrality by 2050. This law introduces new measures to deliver a climate-neutral building stock by 2050. So what will it do? Firstly, it will modernise Europe’s building stock by setting so-called ‘minimum energy performance standards – MEPS’, requiring the buildings that waste the most energy to be gradually improved. This is the most cost-effective approach with the greatest potential to reduce energy bills and emissions, and MEPS will apply to buildings in the non-residential sector like office buildings and hospitals. And while there are no obligations on individual homeowners, Member States can apply MEPS to the residential sector, amongst other measures, to deliver reductions in average energy use. Secondly, to support building owners and vulnerable households, financing measures, information services like one-stop shops and social safeguards are included. We are directing money to renovations with a clear policy framework to help scale up and direct public and private money to renovations. Member States must ensure that their national building renovation plans are sufficiently financed and they must draw from EU funds to do this. That financial support must prioritise vulnerable households. And Member States must also protect tenants by addressing disproportionate rent increases that may cause eviction through renovations. And buildings can also be made exempt from MEPS in case of serious hardship or where renovations are not cost effective. Finally, thousands of local jobs in construction, renovation and renewable industries will be created. We are supporting SMEs and the economy as a whole. Some Member States will also introduce training schemes to increase the availability of skilled workers. Considerable emission reductions are expected, helping us to protect current and future generations of Europeans from the worst impacts of climate change. Colleagues, it is clear we are at the start of a demanding journey towards climate neutrality by 2050. However, we cannot shy away from the task because it is difficult. Citizens in every Member State represented in this Parliament are struggling with high energy bills and poor-quality homes. This law will improve people’s lives.

Mohammed Chahim,"Mr President, on behalf of Mr Engerer thanks to all for this very good debate. We’ve heard many good points there. I want to emphasise one small element: this mechanism is voluntary, so I think complaining about administrative burden is not something that you should state, I think, in relation to this legislation. We shouldn’t create misinformation. We are not obliging companies to make those claims in the first place, but if you make them, make sure that those claims are supported. It’s all about protecting consumers from these false claims and enabling consumers, but also producers and businesses that do make efforts to improve when it comes to their climate footprint. And I think today, by supporting, hopefully tomorrow, this legislation, we will very clearly state under which conditions these claims can be made, and when consumers buy these products, for them it will be clear that those claims are also really true. And we already see small businesses across Europe making efforts to be more sustainable, but again, I’m telling you, we also see businesses that make these false claims and state that they are committed to the Green Deal, although we know that these claims cannot be underlined. So let’s support this legislation tomorrow, let’s protect consumers, let’s enable them to buy products that really support our strategic plans, like the Green Deal.

Seán Kelly,"A Uachtaráin, most European citizens want to reduce their carbon footprint, and to that end they try to buy products which are seen to be sustainable. The problem is, of course, they are not sustainable. Europe is awash with greenwashing. I’ll give an example: in my own country, a company claimed that it was producing products using renewable energy. It was, but guess how much? Five per cent renewable energy, the rest was fossil fuels. So this has to stop and I’m delighted we’re making an effort here. On the other hand, you have farmers who are storing carbon in their soils, and without a carbon farming framework they cannot be rewarded. Indeed, there are those who do not want to reward them; they want to use all stick and no carrot.

Didier Reynders,"Monsieur le Président. Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, je suis très heureux d’être devant vous ce soir pour ce débat sur la directive relative à la définition des infractions pénales et des sanctions applicables en cas de violation des mesures restrictives de l’Union. La Commission a, comme vous le savez, accueilli très favorablement l’accord politique provisoire conclu en trilogue le 12 décembre dernier, et je tiens à remercier la rapporteure, Sophie in ’t Veld, les rapporteurs fictifs et l’ensemble du Parlement pour le travail réalisé dans le cadre de ce dossier. La présente directive constitue une avancée cruciale pour assurer une mise en œuvre efficace des mesures restrictives de l’Union. Il s’agit notamment d’un enjeu essentiel en ce qui concerne les sanctions prises à l’encontre de la Russie et de la Biélorussie à la suite de l’agression russe contre l’Ukraine. Cette directive représente une véritable valeur ajoutée dans la mise en œuvre des mesures restrictives en ce qu’elle établit une harmonisation pénale au niveau de l’Union, et je vous remercie d’avoir fait progresser cette proposition que la Commission avait mise sur la table. – Mr President, the directive includes a comprehensive list of crimes linked to violations of EU restrictive measures, including any attempts at their circumvention. For example, a failure to freeze assets belonging to a designated person or concealing transfer of funds through a third party that should be frozen will have to be treated as criminal offences in all EU Member States. The directive also safeguards humanitarian work from criminalisation, granting legal certainty to aid providers. Moreover, the directive sets common types and levels of penalties, specifying minimum maximum levels of imprisonment for natural persons and criminal or non-criminal fines for legal persons, thus enhancing their deterrent effect. Let me also recall the important link between this directive and the revised Directive on asset recovery and confiscation. Collectively, they will establish a more efficient system of freezing and confiscation within the European Union, ensuring that breaches of EU restrictive measures are not profitable. Thanks to these new rules, enforcement will be significantly strengthened. Stronger coordination and cooperation will be ensured between the competent authorities at national level and between Member States to tackle cross-border violations. Each Member State will be required to designate a dedicated unit or body to ensure coordination and cooperation between law enforcement authorities and authorities in charge of implementing EU restrictive measures. The Member States, along with Eurojust, Europol, the European Public Prosecutor’s Office and the Commission, will cooperate in the fight against the violation of EU restrictive measures within their respective competences to strengthen cross-border and international cooperation. In conclusion, the directive will allow for more uniform application of EU sanctions and more effective prosecution of offenders across Member States. This is a major step in combatting the violation of EU restrictive measures. It shows once more than the European Union is determined to take decisive action against those who try to circumvent them. It is very important to make progress in such a way. I’m sure that, of course, it’s an important decision to take some sanctions, like the 13th package that we have decided to put into place. But it’s maybe more important to be sure that we have the capacity to enforce those sanctions and to fight against all the different attempts to circumvent the sanctions. So I will now be listening with interest to your interventions and, of course, we will continue to work together with the Member States for the transposition as far as possible and as soon as possible of the directive.",-,2024-03-11,16.

Sophia in 't Veld,"Mr President, colleagues, let me start by, first of all, saying thanks to the Commission for putting on the table a very good proposal and being extremely helpful throughout the trilogues and also thanking my colleagues, the shadows, because I think it was an exceptionally good cooperation, a very strong consensus. I would also like to express my commiserations to the poor Spanish Presidency who had to put up with us – well, me – at the very end of their presidency when they were already worn out. Let me give a few examples illustrating why we need this legislation. Since the start of the Russian invasion and the ensuing EU sanctions, export of goods from the EU to Russia dropped by 47%, but exports from the EU to Armenia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan grew by 48% in the same period. That is not a coincidence. Second example, I quote the Irish head of the Department of Finance Anti-Money Laundering Unit. She says, ‘authorities could be aware of cases where Russian money was moving through funds based in the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin, but it cannot actually do anything about it’. Third example, while Ukrainian soldiers are fighting on the muddy battlefields, we witness a huge increase of car exports from Germany to Russia via Kyrgyzstan, oligarchs holidaying at the Cote d’Azur and their kids attending posh European schools, and we see nodal modes like Cyprus being far behind in freezing assets of Russian oligarchs. Now, since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the EU has adopted 13 packages of sanctions, and that includes putting asset freezes and travel restrictions for no less than 1 718 individuals in 419 entities such as banks, companies and media organisations. They prohibit the imports of Russian oil, diamonds and other raw materials. They prohibit the exports of military technology and dual-use goods to Russia and luxury goods. It restricts Russia’s access to the EU’s capital and financial markets, and prohibits the provision of all sorts of services like advertising, brokering services and legal advice. However, in the real world, laws can and will be broken because crooks make enormous amounts of money with it, and this, of course, benefits the Russian invasion. Therefore, it needs to stop. But the huge divergences in legislation and enforcement allow them to go forum shopping, searching for the weakest spots, the lowest chance to get caught and facing the lowest possible sentences and fines. So, therefore, this directive is supposed to bring an end to those practices and make the sanctions more effective. Now, Parliament and the Council had a different approach and ambitions. The Council wanted to limit the scope exclusively to the simple fact of criminalising the violation of Union restrictive measures, and they were unwilling to change a jot to their national criminal law systems; whereas Parliament focused on harmonisation and enforcement, because it’s not good enough to have sanctions or even criminalise the violation of sanctions when there is no proper enforcement, and when Member States pretty much do what they like. The problem is, of course, that the Member States know that the European Commission is not enforcing very strictly, looking the other way, and there are no serious consequences. Therefore, Parliament wanted to close all the loopholes. So, due to the reluctance of the Council and the enormous time pressure, we did not manage to close all the holes. However, there is progress compared to the current situation. First of all, violation and circumvention of sanctions will be criminalised in all Member States. No escape. A modest degree of harmonisation of penalties has been achieved and the enforcement cooperation between the Member States, the Commission and EPPO will be structured, not ad hoc. I regret that the Council was unwilling to go further and to close all the loopholes and to make sure that Putin’s friends have nowhere to hide any more. But for us, it was also important to conclude the file and give a strong signal to our friends in Ukraine. Therefore, we accepted this outcome, even if it’s less ambitious.

Barry Andrews,"Mr President, Commissioner and colleagues, sanctions work and are working against Russia when it is estimated that it has lost greater than EUR 400 billion from its economy as a result of EU sanctions, thus restricting its capacity to pursue its imperialist and illegal war in Ukraine. This directive is aimed at circumvention and I would expect also a strong focus on the subsidiaries of EU companies. I would ask the Commission to give serious consideration to the establishment of an EU office focused on circumvention and implementation of sanctions at Member State level, as recommended by the EU Sanctions Envoy, David O’Sullivan. The one glaring omission from the wide range of sanctions deployed by the EU is Israel. Given the German Foreign Ministry last week tweeted its condemnation of the expansion of West Bank settlements, describing it in its tweet as a grave violation of international humanitarian law, with the humanitarian crisis in Gaza reaching the level of a famine and children starving to death, it is towering hypocrisy for the EU to exclude this crisis from its programme of sanctions.",Renew,2024-03-11,16.

Clare Daly,"Mr President, EU sanctions: when they are not backfiring against ordinary Europeans, they are firing on all cylinders against ordinary people in the Global South. By overwhelming majorities, the United Nations General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council have over the years again and again and again and again, condemned the kinds of unilateral sanctions that the EU and US apply against poorer countries. They have said that they disproportionately harm the most vulnerable. They have said that they undermine people’s human rights. Again and again, they have called on the West to stop adopting and implementing them. And here we are not only ignoring this global condemnation, but going further and criminalising those who dare to fail to comply with them in the first place. Meanwhile, we refuse to impose a sanction that we are legally obligated to impose – that of an arms embargo on Israel. This, friends, is the rules-based international order. Sixty percent of people worldwide who rely on humanitarian aid are in countries under sanction. Most need aid because of the sanctions. Sanctions are weapons of war in the Global South. They starve and they destroy. And they most always never achieve what they are supposed to do.

Sophia in 't Veld,"Mr President, I’ll be brief, because this is a fairly consensual file. Two last remarks. One very important aspect that has just been highlighted by the Commissioner is that this law will also enable us to confiscate assets which have been frozen, because now there will be a criminal act, which will allow us to confiscate those assets – which I think is just and fair. But the second aspect is – of course I’m very grateful for the European Commission to put forward this legislative proposal – but we also know that one of the reasons that the sanctions can be violated so easily in some places is that national authorities are maybe slightly less ambitious than we would like – and I’m being very diplomatic here, it’s Monday evening – in applying the law.

Didier Reynders,"Mr President, honourable Members, just one year after the submission of the Commission’s proposal, a political agreement was achieved on the regulation which opens the era of digital labelling for EU fertilising products. With this agreement, consumers and farmers will benefit from the potential of digitisation when purchasing EU fertilising products. We welcome that the text stays close to the initial Commission proposal in many important aspects. In particular, it allows the full digital digitisation of labels for products trade among economic operators and extends this practice to products sold to end users without packaging. But that is not all, the compromise puts in place measures that ensure that no one is left behind, and that all farmers and non-professional users will have access to information, regardless of their digital skills and access to digital services. Overall, the agreement provides for potential to reduce costs for businesses and incentives to invest in digital labelling. The Commission, however, regrets that the final agreement includes a problematic reference to the General Product Safety Regulation with relation to EU fertilising products in recital 12, and therefore wishes to make the following declaration, so a statement of the Commission on recital 12: ‘The Commission expresses concern about the wording of the last sentence of recital 12. The Commission considers that Article 16 of the Regulation on General Product Safety, which lays down the obligation to establish a responsible person for products placed on the Union market, does not apply to products subject to the regulation or fertilising products.’ Having said this, the Commission would like to warmly thank Parliament for its work on this important file and, in particular, I would like to extend my congratulations to the rapporteur, Ms Grapini.

The Commission considers that Article 16 of Regulation 2023/988 [on general product safety], which lays down the obligation of establishment of a ‘responsible person’ for products placed on the Union market, does not apply to products subject to Regulation (EU) 2019/1009.” Spontane Wortmeldungen",-,2024-03-11,18.

Mick Wallace,"Mr President, when it was founded in 2002, the European Maritime Safety Agency had a narrow focus on the monitoring of ship movements, but its role has expanded into areas such as coastguard operations and the surveillance of migration flows. The agency is increasingly complicit in the militarisation and externalisation of the EU’s border policies. From 2018 to 2020, the Maritime Agency leased drones to a Portuguese company that were manufactured by Israel’s largest military company, Elbit Systems. That contract was worth EUR 59 million. Israel developed and battle-tested these drones in Gaza in its brutal and inhumane treatment of Palestinians. Border security is a central part of the European security research programme, and the Commission has used this programme consistently in order to support the development of a competitive European security industry. This has allowed military technology to be systematically transferred to border management. The defence industry is making a fortune while we allow migrants to drown at sea.

Didier Reynders,"Mr President, honourable Members, I want to start by thanking the rapporteur, Ms Monteiro de Aguiar, and the shadow rapporteurs, for their work on the draft report on the revision of the funding for a regulation on the European Maritime Safety Agency. The role of this agency is invaluable in helping the Commission and the Member States to confront the various challenges facing maritime transport, starting with safety, but also in relation to sustainability and security. However, as this role has evolved over time – not least through new tasks being entrusted to the agency via different EU legal acts – we need to ensure that its mandate is up to date, and that the agency is properly equipped to deliver on it. The Commission is carefully considering all of the amendments that you have proposed. Tonight I would like to focus on a few key points of your draft report. First, on resources, we all agree that the agency needs more resources, and the resources are central for the European Maritime Safety Agency to be able to deliver on its new and extended tasks. In line with the Commission’s common practice, we propose to offset a budgetary increase for the agency with a reduction in spending under the Connecting Europe Facility–Transport. The Commission takes note of your difference of opinion. We understand your concerns that the Connecting Europe Facility–Transport budget would, as a consequence, be further reduced. However, as a general principle, the Commission compensates for an increase in the EU contribution to decentralised agencies by reducing programmed spending. This ensures that the budgetary authority has room for manoeuvre to finance new emerging priorities. As you know, there was also virtually no margin for an increase under the current multiannual financial framework. Setting the annual budget is the prerogative of the European Parliament and the Council, but the Commission hopes that we can count on your support to ensure that the agency has access to appropriate resources. On governance, your draft report proposes several amendments that, in our view, would weaken the Commission’s ability to oversee the agency’s activities. I would like to recall that the Commission is ultimately responsible for ensuring that human resource and budgetary decisions by the management board respect the applicable legal framework. Responsibility for the oversight of the agency is also political. In response to a few cases of mismanagement, the European Parliament has previously requested that the Commission exercises its right of oversight of decentralised agencies very closely. On our proposal for the agency to charge a fee for certain services, I can assure you that the Commission does not intend to radically change the agency’s funding model. Following the vote on your report in Plenary tomorrow, the Commission looks forward to progress in Council on this file, with the adoption of a general approach in order for trilogues to begin early in the new parliamentary term. So thank you very much for your remarks, your amendments, and we will continue the discussions with the new Parliament in the new term after the elections.",-,2024-03-11,19.

Clare Daly,"Mr President, I have to say, I really welcome this report because I firmly believe that alternative dispute resolution processes should be used as widely as possible, whether it’s consumer law or family law. Things like mediation get results that are at least as good, if not actually better than anything that would come out of a court process. And given the huge issues facing, for example, Ireland’s family law system, including the massive problems with concepts such as parental alienation creeping into it and being put forward by court experts who aren’t experts, it really would be better if we were to support available and robust and effective mediation processes. I come from a country with some of the highest legal costs in Europe. They are at levels which have been criticised consistently in the EU rule of law reports as being a barrier to justice. That means that alternative dispute resolution is often people’s only option and if that’s not available, then they’re out of options.

Among other important things, this resolution says we should not mix up Putin’s regime and Russian people. But these were only words because in fact, we do not make the difference. There is a saying in Russian: fear has big eyes. And if one looks at a Russian passport with these big eyes, he would not be able to make the difference between Putin and a random Russian pensioner living in the EU. So right now, Latvia is preparing to deport almost 1 000 Russian citizens who used to be permanently residing in the country for three decades because they did not pass the language test, which was not the condition to get permission to live in this country back then. These Russian citizens are not living in ghetto. These are members of the families of Latvian citizens, mostly their grandfathers and grandmothers.

The Saharawi people are also exiled from their lands, their valuable resources robbed by Morocco – with whom we do business – while 77% of their people depend on World Food Programme baskets and they only receive 10% of the funding that they need.

Thierry Breton,"Mr President, honourable Members, first, I would like to thank you for hosting this very important debate. I would like to start by thanking Rapporteur Engerer and, of course, Rapporteur Andrus Ansip, as well as the shadow rapporteurs, of course, but also, the chairs of the IMCO and ENVI committees. The Green Claims Directive proposal aims to help mobilising industry for a clean and circular economy, while also empowering consumers to make more sustainable choices. We know that many citizens want to go green, but they find it quite hard in practice often. Yes, it’s true, it’s often difficult for consumers to separate, let’s say, fact from fiction. What we propose is a new regulatory framework to ensure consumers get reliable and also certified and verified information. For companies, it means more legal certainty and also a level playing field. The Commission is pleased that the Parliament has proposed to maintain the overall ambition. The Commission would still like to draw your attention on a few points. Firstly, we recognise that both Member States and businesses, in particular SMEs, should have, of course, enough time to transpose and adapt to this new legislation. That said, the proposal for diverging deadlines for different actors will have to be weighted up against the importance of an overall timely and proper implementation, effective consumer protection, a level playing field, of course, and enforceability by competent authorities. Secondly, regarding the rules for climate-related claims, the report is in line with the intention to prioritise companies’ own emission reductions and to address residual emissions with removals. But the approach proposed might end up reducing demand for credits, including high quality ones, from voluntary carbon markets. While we may understand the underlying rationale behind restricting compensation for fossil emissions solely to permanent carbon removals, this could come at the expense of incentive for natural-based carbon farming removals, which are essential for our climate transition, and to support farmers in their sustainable activities. Thirdly, we regret to see that some amendments would reduce the effectiveness of this instrument to counteract the proliferation of labels. Having widely recognised labels from the EU markets would help consumers choose sustainable products more easily and reduce costs for businesses operating on the EU single market. And finally, we do need to be practical and realistic, and any new obligation or procedure added during the negotiations increasing the workload for the Commission must be very carefully assessed. The obligation and deadline set for the Commission must be proportional to the resources it has at its disposal. So, honourable Members, the Commission hopes that today’s discussion will pave the way to a positive outcome of the vote of tomorrow.",-,2024-03-11,14.

Kim Van Sparrentak,"Mr President, plastic-free, no palm oil, free from recycled plastic, carbon neutral – walking around in a supermarket, you could easily think that most products are sustainable already. And that is why 61 % of consumers find it difficult to know which products are the best for the environment. And their intuition is correct, because 50 % of green claims are vague or misleading. Companies are abusing the willingness of consumers to make the right choice for the planet and are constantly lying to us. But – maybe this is a wakeup call for some – Amazon and Shell, they are not climate champions and this greenwashing needs to stop. Greenwashing is not only bad for the consumer, but also for those companies that are truly sustainable and that, in the end, is also bad for the planet. And for everyone who claims this is complicated for businesses, it is not. It’s very simple. Companies that want to make a green claim will need to prove, based on scientific evidence, that what they claim is true and have it verified by external experts. It’s a shame that political groups are trying to undermine this text, and even ones who use it to legalise greenwashing practices by scrapping the entire article on penalties and by allowing highly polluting industries to remain silent on their overall environmental impact.

Mick Wallace,"Mr President, this revision of the 40-year-old Product Liability Directive means consumers should be better protected and should find it easier to claim compensation for damages caused by a faulty product. But it is not enough simply to have legislation in place; it must be enforced. In Ireland, the defective block scandal has devastated families in Limerick, Clare, Donegal and Mayo. At the heart of this scandal are repeated breaches of EU legislation. It is clear that the blocks did not meet the standards of the Construction Product Directive. It is also clear that the market surveillance regulations were breached. Ireland did not grant any entity market surveillance power for construction products, and it did not report any market surveillance activities to the Commission between January 2010 and July 2013. After July 2013, surveillance was reactive only, not proactive. To add insult to injury, the redress scheme is not fit for purpose and is inflicting more pain on the victims.",The Left,2024-03-11,17.

Andrus Ansip,"Mr President, dear Commissioner, dear colleagues, the overall goal of the Green Claims Directive is to increase transparency of green claims made by traders. There is a need to increase the trust of our consumers and bring legal clarity to our entrepreneurs. Unfortunately, the current situation with green claims and labels in Europe is not satisfactory. Studies show that over 50 % of companies’ environmental claims, such as ‘climate neutral’, ‘carbon neutral’ or ‘100% CO2 compensated’ are vague, misleading or unfounded. Consumers do not have a way to assess the truthfulness of such claims. They do not understand that a claim that is made about the entire product can, in fact, concern only a certain aspect of the product. In half of the cases, the traders provide a weak or completely absent verification of their green claims. Greenwashing is a real problem. Exactly the same claim can have a totally different meaning in different EU Member States. There is a need to harmonise the rules about green claims. Citizens and companies want to be certain that nobody is cheating when using green claims. Level playing field and fair competition are crucial also when we talk about products coming from third countries. Companies are ready to pay to get a more level playing field, but they are not ready to pay more than they are expecting to gain. It is important that to avoid adding a disproportionate administrative burden to our companies and Member States. I believe that our IMCO-ENVI proposal on the Green Claims Directive is more balanced. It will bring clarity to our consumers and is less burdensome for traders. I believe that we have achieved a reasonable solution. Therefore, I invite everyone to support the compromise we reached and not reopen the questions that we already have agreed. The amendments proposed by myself and the co-rapporteur Mr Engerer, are of technical nature to align our Green Claims text with the recent outcome of the trilogues on the Carbon Removal Certification Framework.

This House will never turn a blind eye to Lukashenka’s relentless crackdown on dissent, and on people being arrested, tortured and imprisoned on politically motivated charges. These sham elections were neither free nor fair. They lacked any semblance of democracy.

President,"We now come to the order of business. The final draft agenda as adopted by the Conference of Presidents on 6 March pursuant to Rule 157 has been distributed. I would like to inform you that I have received one request for urgent procedure from the ECON Committee, pursuant to Rule 163, on the following legislative file: ‘Subscription by the Union to additional shares in the capital of the EBRD and the amendment of the Agreement establishing the EBRD’. The vote on this request will be taken tomorrow. If adopted, the vote will be held on Thursday. With the agreement of the political groups, I wish to put to the House the following proposals for changes to the final draft agenda. For Tuesday, due to the postponement of the related Commission communication, the Commission statement on pre-enlargement reforms and policy reviews, scheduled for Tuesday afternoon, is removed from the agenda. For Wednesday, the following items, initially planned for a vote on Wednesday during the second voting session, are advanced to the first voting session: the reports by Mr Oetjen on reporting requirements in the fields of road transport and aviation (regulation), and on reporting requirements (decision); the report by Ms Virkkunen on minimum requirements on minimum breaks and daily and weekly rest periods in the occasional passenger transport sector; the report by Ms Clune on establishing the European Union Customs Code and the European Union Customs Authority, and repealing Regulation (EU) No 952/2013; and the report by Mr Van Overtveldt on Amending Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 on European statistics. In addition, the reports by Ms Kalniete on temporary trade-liberalisation measures supplementing trade concessions applicable to Ukrainian products under the EU/Euratom/Ukraine Association Agreement, and by Ms Gregorová on temporary trade-liberalisation measures supplementing trade concessions applicable to Moldovan products under the EU/Euratom/Moldova Association Agreement are added to the vote in the second voting session on Wednesday. The deadlines for the report by Ms Kalniete are as follows: amendments by Tuesday, 12 March at 12.00; and split and separate votes by Tuesday, 12 March at 19.00. If there are no objections, these changes are approved. We will now move to changes requested by political groups. For Tuesday, the ID Group has requested that a joint debate consisting of a Commission statement on temporary trade-liberalisation measures applicable to Ukraine and Moldova, the report by Ms Gregorová on temporary trade-liberalisation measures supplementing trade concessions applicable to Moldovan products and the report by Ms Kalniete on temporary trade-liberalisation measures supplementing trade concessions applicable to Ukrainian products be added as the second item in the afternoon, after Question Time to the Commission.

Bart Groothuis,"Mr President, dear Commissioner, colleagues, thanks to the pressure that’s been put in this House, these European Union buildings like this one are fully equipped with Western hard- and software. But our colleagues in the African Union were less fortunate. Their building is fully equipped with Chinese equipment and, demonstrably, that is being spied and being used against them in their own buildings. Now, last week, malicious software was discovered in our ports and harbours, here in our vital infrastructure. There’s plenty of concerns – all European intelligence agencies have these concerns about Chinese hard- and software, for example, being leveraged in their offensive espionage program – leveraged against us. So we need legislation, and this week we vote on the cybersecurity legislation of hard- and software products in a very good law. Also, because of your support, but also because we, in Parliament, introduced measures that enable the European Commission to impose market limitation, market restrictions to risky vendors and products because our citizens demand security, which means concrete decoupling. So the basis for decoupling and de-risking – sorry, not decoupling, but de-risking – is now here and now we need the full force of the European Commission to execute and keep us safe.",Renew,2024-03-11,13.

Henna Virkkunen,"Mr President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, as the first legislation of its kind, the Cyber Resilience Act is much called for and necessary for the security of digital products in the EU internal market. Currently, many digital products that originate from third countries are sold in the internal market, but the level of the cybersecurity and possible software updates is unknown. The trilogue outcome of the Cyber Resilience Act is a balanced agreement that will provide better consumer protection and boost also fair competition. It will ensure that all digital products that are put on the EU market, both hardware and software, are cyber-secure throughout their whole life cycle and will receive security updates. Promoting innovation is crucial for ensuring European competitiveness. We need to make sure that our smallest enterprises are not faced with an overly heavy administrative burden. Necessary flexibility and legal certainty is needed for small businesses to operate and grow. The CRA will ensure that our micro- and small enterprises are supported, especially through training and in conformity assessment procedures. The number of cyberattacks is consistently growing and they are becoming more sophisticated every day. Small businesses and critical institutions are targeted by cybercriminals. Cybersecurity concerns all sectors of society. Common rules and standards can significantly reduce vulnerabilities and risks related to digital products. Cybersecurity by design can help ensure our overall security.

We can provide information, carry out risk assessments and cable mapping, and cooperate with the expert group in this way.

Mick Wallace,"Mr President, one of the root causes of migration is the trading of arms and their subsequent use in conflict. European arms exports have been directly linked to the forced displacement of millions. The arms trade is a lucrative industry that profits both from conflict and from militarising the migration routes it helps to create. And the EU is helping the business boom. The Commission has given away billions in taxpayers’ money to border control companies that torture and kill people seeking safety, either through direct contracts or through dodgy deals with third countries. These are crimes committed with our resources, in our names. The EU has chosen to turn human misery into a business opportunity rather than evaluate the underlying causes of displacement.

Didier Reynders,"Mr President, honourable Members, I will describe first the facts. Last year, there were 157 000 irregular crossings to Italy. More than 70% disembarked on Lampedusa: more than 109 000 people. The main nationalities arriving in Italy were Guineans, Tunisians and Ivorians, Bangladeshis, Egyptians and Syrians. Arrivals dropped significantly in the first two months of this year, with relatively few irregular crossings. Occupancy of Italian reception centres, including Lampedusa, is well below capacity. You ask what we are doing to reduce migration pressure on Lampedusa and the EU as a whole. We are working on two tracks: legislative and operational. On legislation, we have the Pact. In December, the Council and Parliament reached an historic agreement on the Pact after three long years of negotiations, establishing a European approach to asylum and migration management. Parliament and the Council now need to formally adopt it. We have already started to prepare the ground for future implementation. Operationally, in September last year, President von der Leyen and Commissioner Johansson visited Lampedusa and the President presented a 10-point plan for Lampedusa. In the context of this plan and the 2022 EU Action Plan for the Central Mediterranean, the Commission has been providing substantial support to Italy. With 450 staff deployed, EU agencies are supporting the Italian authorities to manage migration and asylum, and with EUR 518.5 million from the home affairs funds for measures to support Italy’s asylum and reception system. We are engaging with countries of origin, like Ivory Coast and Guinea and other sub-Saharan countries, to address root causes and counter the smuggling networks. Our Memorandum of Understanding with Tunisia is producing results: a substantial reduction in departures to the European Union last September and October, and a corresponding reduction in arrivals to Lampedusa. Last November, we launched a global coalition against migrant smuggling. Some 75 countries took part in its first conference and we propose new EU laws to crack down on smuggling networks. Reducing irregular migration will increase possibilities for regular migration, which many Member States want and need. We are stepping up on returns of people who do not have the right to stay by cooperating on return and readmission with third countries. The Commission has serious doubts about the concept of floating accommodation centres, and the arrangement would have to meet the standards set out in EU legislation when it comes to the provision of adequate reception conditions and the processing of asylum applications. Under current Union law, people seeking international protection who are present in the territorial waters of a Member State should be disembarked on land to have their applications examined. We have retained the same principle in the Pact. Finally, concerning the terrorists who killed two Swedish football supporters in Brussels, I am from Belgium and my colleague, Commissioner Ylva Johansson, who I’m standing in for today, is from Sweden. This attack shocked us both on a very personal level. It seems the perpetrator had lived in the EU for many years and applied for asylum in several Member States, which had all been rejected. If anything, this asks for Member States to step up on returns, which we are pursuing with our return coordinator and a high-level network on returns, prioritising the returns of people who pose a security threat. And if anything, this argues for a swift implementation of the Pact, which will ensure that everyone is screened at the external border and that swift decisions on asylum and return are taken. When it comes to migration and asylum, there are no magic bullets, only comprehensive policies covering all possible aspects. And this is what we are doing with the Pact, with our operational work and all the support we are providing to the Member States. We do not need hypothetical floating reception centres when we have the reality of the Pact, the reality of an historic agreement on migration. So I call on you all to support the Pact and the implementation of the Pact.",-,2024-02-29,10.

Tineke Strik,"Mr President, dear Commissioner, some politicians like to claim we are in a migration crisis, because they profit from it.

The right to asylum is being eroded, dignified reception has become an illusion and impunity is now the norm. And in this race to the bottom, Member States prefer to approve each other’s violations rather than take responsibility for their fair share. And these crises are being fuelled by extreme narratives and dehumanisation. For the extreme right, migration is a business model, but by exploiting refugees, they attack our core values and this indirectly leads to more human rights violations, to more deaths. Chair, deterrence is not the answer. Taking responsibility is – and I urge Member States to take responsibility equally and fairly and to show true solidarity through relocation. The genuine reflection of our values lies in how we treat the most vulnerable. And right now, at our borders, these values are dying fast.",Greens/EFA,2024-02-29,10.

Clare Daly,"Mr President, for months now in Ireland, the media and the politicians have been obsessed with talk of immigration: we have to have an ‘honest’ conversation about migration, they tell us we have no choice in the matter at all. Funny enough now though, they’re very good at ignoring things when they want to. For example, if you’re demanding a right to housing or healthcare or disability rights, well then they don’t want to know. But if you’re talking about immigration, then you’re not talking about those things. You’re not talking about how your state is serving transnational capital rather than the citizens. In reality, it is the great deceit. In Britain, for example, they’ve been consumed by a conversation about migration for more than a decade now. Savage austerity? Well, it got right off the hook. So, while they were being ‘honest’ about migration, child poverty skyrocketed. Britain now has the highest child poverty, housing is broken, people are hounded to death, austerity is a permanent policy while the rich get richer. And migration? Same as it always was.

Didier Reynders,"Mr President, honourable Members, I was impressed by many comments and statements during such a debate, but it is maybe useful to recall what we have organised as a policy since four years. In the last four years, we have been building a European migration policy. As I said before, legislatively and operationally, it was possible to put into place a comprehensive policy that addresses all aspects of migration and asylum: fighting the smugglers, countering irregular migration and improving opportunities for regular migration, working with third countries on returns, and supporting Member States in need with staff and some budget. Three months ago, Parliament and Council reached an historic agreement on the Pact and, again, it is very important to continue to work on the implementation of the Pact, which will give irregular migrants quick clarity about asylum or return, and with mandatory solidarity measures to support Member States in need. If we want to help the population of Lampedusa, if we want to help the people arriving there after horrendous journeys, then what we need now most of all is to turn this agreement into a reality. And so, again, I call on you to do everything to support the Pact and the implementation of the Pact.

We don’t know. For far too long, the platforms have protected their data to hide the true nature of their impact on housing, to block the enforcement of regulation, and for too long to prevent cities from collecting taxes. But of course, we know their lobbying influence and how much sway they have.

Approximately 75% of cables in the Northern Hemisphere pass through or are in close proximity to Irish waters. These cables play a crucial role in facilitating 97% – yes, 97% – of worldwide communications, encompassing financial transactions, business activities and everyday internet connectivity. No wonder Russian submarines have been observed more and more off our coast. It’s time for an Irish approach, but also a common EU approach. Ireland is also seen, unfortunately, as a soft touch for the transit of illegal drugs, as shown by the seizure of EUR 33 million of crystal meth in a warehouse not far from where I live, in my constituency, which came from Mexico and was eventually bound for Australia.

Didier Reynders,"Mr President, honourable Members, Chile was the first country in Latin America to sign an association agreement with the European Union, back in 2002. Today, Chile is again the first country of the region with whom we signed a new generation of advanced framework and agreements. This speaks volumes of the deep and trustful relationship the European Union has with Chile. With this new agreement, we are modernising and updating our partnership to adapt to a new and challenging geopolitical context. In doing so, we have identified opportunities to strengthen our links with our Chilean partner. The Commission’s message today is simple. We want to build on our solid foundation with Chile, to advance further together. We want to deepen our political dialogue, expand our cooperation and boost our economic relationship to match our ambitions. Thanks to this agreement, we will reinforce engagement and collaboration in new areas, such as human rights, gender equality, sustainable trade, protection of agrifood, geographical indications, sustainable food systems, environment and the fight against climate change. The new agreement will help us cooperate and address common challenges and opportunities in peace, justice and security, as well as in key areas like energy and raw materials cooperation. Chile is indeed a key partner for the European Union. With the new agreement, the EU and Chile will have a perfect platform to grow closer as partners, allies and supporters of the multilateral system. This matters more than ever in a world of increasing geopolitical tensions. Crucially, Chile is a key partner of the EU to cooperate on secure, stable, reliable and sustainable supplies of key raw materials, like copper and lithium, and energy sources, like green hydrogen. These are crucial for our industry and for the green digital transition, and we can work together for our mutual benefit. Honourable Members, as you know, we signed a new EU-Chile agreement last December. The Commission hopes that the agreement will come into force very rapidly. On the EU side, after the consent of the European Parliament, the Interim Trade Agreement can be rapidly adopted by the Council. The Commission understands that Chile will also start the ratification process very soon. If all goes well, we may have the Interim Trade Agreement in force after the summer. The agreement has all the elements to become a success story. The Commission is committed to make sure the new agreement lives up to its potential over the next decades. We have our work cut out as soon as the agreement comes into force. I am referring to the review of the trade and sustainable development chapter of the agreement. We have negotiated an ambitious joint statement for the review of the trade and sustainable development chapter. This review process is to be launched as soon as the Interim Trade Agreement comes into force. The text of the joint statement clearly spells out our level of ambition. We cannot prejudge the outcome of the review, but we will strive to achieve a very ambitious outcome. We are aware that this is a top priority for Parliament, and I am confident we will be able to meet our objectives through the review of the trade and sustainable development chapter. With regard to this, in preparation for today’s debate, the Commission has issued a formal statement on the role of, and the arrangement with, the European Parliament in the forthcoming review of the trade and sustainable development chapter. The statement is being sent to Parliament’s services for inclusion in the verbatim record of this debate. I would like to conclude by thanking our Chilean counterparts and friends for a very difficult job well done and for the good cooperation. I have expressed also such thanks to the Chilean Ambassador, who is present today with us. We have enjoyed during this journey again the same cooperation, which bodes well for the work ahead. So thank you very much for your support. We have a lot of things to do to achieve the entry into force of such an agreement. Commission statement (in writing) The Interim Trade Agreement before you today is accompanied by a joint statement, which expresses the Parties’ commitment to initiate, upon entry into force of the Agreement, a formal review process of its trade and sustainable development aspects with the aim to conclude the review process within 12 months. The explicit purpose of this review is – and I quote – to “consider the incorporation, as appropriate, of additional provisions that may be deemed relevant by either Party at that time, including in the context of their respective domestic policy developments and their recent international treaty practice”. The Commission will closely involve the European Parliament in this review process. In line with its obligations under the Framework Agreement, the Commission will inform the European Parliament, sufficiently in advance, of its intention to present a proposal for an amendment to the agreement and share the initial text of the proposal. The Commission will take due account of Parliament’s comments throughout the negotiations and will keep the Parliament regularly and promptly informed about the conduct of negotiations and explain whether and how Parliament’s comments were incorporated in the texts under negotiation and, if not, why. In this review process, the Commission will be guided by, inter alia, its communication of 22 June 2022 on “The power of trade partnerships: together for green and just economic growth” . This relates, in particular, to further enhancing the enforcement mechanism, including the extension of the general state-to-state dispute settlement compliance stage to the trade and sustainable development chapter. This also includes the possibility to suspend preferences as measure of last resort in cases of failure to comply with obligations that materially defeat the object and purpose of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change or in serious instances of non-compliance with the ILO fundamental principles and rights at work. In line with the 2022 Communication, the Commission will step up cooperation with Chile, providing incentives and support if needed, to foster compliance with international labour and environmental standards. The Commission is committed to use the Interim Trade Agreement to facilitate dialogue with Chile and, as appropriate, assist Chile in meeting the sustainability requirements of the Union’s autonomous instruments to support sustainable trade. The EU-Chile Interim Trade Agreement provides for an important role for civil society in the monitoring of its implementation, including with regard to the Parties’ compliance with the labour and environmental commitments contained in the trade and sustainable development chapter. It obliges each Party to create or designate a Domestic Consultative Group, which will advise it on the implementation of the agreement. The Commission will engage closely with civil society, and particularly with the Domestic Consultative Group established under the agreement. It will work with Chile to ensure that each side will provide resources and information to its Domestic Consultative Groups for their capacity building and functioning, in line with its domestic legislation and policies.",-,2024-02-29,2.

Didier Reynders,"Mr President, honourable Members, dear Ambassador, it has been quite a journey from the launch of negotiations to today. But thanks to the hard work and the determination of the Chilean and European teams, including the European Parliament, we have made it. The new agreement between the EU and Chile is a very modern and progressive deal. It is not only good for trade and investment and our respective economic resilience in this challenging geopolitical context, it also sends a clear message to the world about our shared commitment to common values and to sustainability, and our resolve to speed up the green and digital transition. The agreement takes European farmers’ sensitivities into account. The European Union will not fully open its market for imports of agri-food products. For sensitive products, access to the EU market will be granted in a limited and strictly controlled way. This will be achieved through carefully calibrated tariff rate quotas. It’s a modernisation of an existing agreement. In the actual agreement, we have already quotas for import of agri-food products with an automatic annual increase that we remove. The Commission would like to thank the European Parliament and, in particular, the honourable Members who have closely followed the entire negotiating process from start to end, for the very good cooperation with the Commission. This good cooperation and team spirit has undoubtedly contributed to the success of this endeavour. On our part, we shall continue working with you in a spirit of openness, transparency and full cooperation also during the implementation of the new agreement.

Samira Rafaela,"Mr President, it’s a great honour to finally have a trade agreement hopefully being passed through Parliament again today. This agreement is ground—breaking, with the first EU gender and trade chapter and a trade and sustainability chapter. This is the most ambitious Trade and Sustainable Development chapter negotiated so far by the EU, with ambitious and binding commitments on environmental and labour standards, and references to the rights of indigenous peoples. It includes a commitment to consider the possibility of including the Paris Agreement on Climate Change as an essential element of the agreement in the form of a review. In this agreement, we have special support for SMEs through a dedicated chapter for SMEs and a new stand—alone chapter on sustainable food systems. 95% of trade will be duty—free and 216 European geographical indications will be protected. With this agreement, we have shown that trade can indeed be responsible and fair, and we have been waiting for this modern and progressive agreement for a long time. In today’s world, it is important that we collaborate with like—minded partners to facilitate the energy transition, to create more jobs, to protect human rights and to ensure security. The amendment of the original agreement from 2002 was crucial to reflect the developments and modernisation and our increasingly sustainable and digital economies, as well as our rules—based trading system, and given the geopolitical situation. Chile is a key partner for the EU and in Latin America, and the EU is Chile’s third—largest trading partner and foreign investor. Our bilateral trade comprises many sectors, including – but not limited to – minerals, such as copper and lithium, machinery and chemicals, and especially agricultural products. The modernised agreement will allow the EU and Chile to strongly increase their bilateral political, trade and investment cooperation, as it will create mutually beneficial new opportunities on both sides. The modernisation is continuing to strengthen these important bilateral trade flows and provides improved market access for goods, services, investment and government procurement, amended investment protection, protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights and the reduction of non—essential non-tariff barriers. The agreement keeps the right to maintain public services. From the beginning, there were multiple key priorities for me, which I’m happy to see covered. I said it before, for the first time in an EU agreement, is there a dedicated chapter on gender and trade so that trade leads to gender equality and women’s empowerment and ultimately benefits all. There are specific provisions and references on the rights of indigenous people. It is key that their rights are respected and upheld in such an important agreement, and the chapters on sustainable development and trade and gender establish and foster the approach towards a green and fair trade relationship. The specific chapter on trade and SMEs is important, since they account for a large proportion of EU—Chile trade, so to assist them in taking full advantage of this agreement will be important. Of course, we must also recognise the role that Chile plays in our green and just transition. Chile has a leading role as a major supplier of critical raw materials, and a lot of these are supplied to the EU, especially when it comes to lithium and copper. Chile also has huge potential when it comes to the creation of clean energy, such as green hydrogen. The energy chapter plays into this. All the while, the agreement leaves sufficient policy space to Chile for local added value, and this has to be done in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner, while it should benefit local communities, including indigenous communities. All in all, I am happy that we have been able to reach such a good agreement with our like—minded partner. I look forward to a final conclusion very soon, and I also hope for a swift ratification procedure by Chile and at EU Member State level. The Advanced Framework Agreement brings our relationship in line with the most advanced standards and unlocks untapped potentials. It will modernise the existing association agreement, opening and improving new areas, including investment liberalisation and investment protection provisions. Political and economic cooperation on the basis of old rules is not an option for the EU anymore, and I am proud that today we are hopefully agreeing with such a modern and progressive agreement. Lastly, I would like to commend the work of the Commission negotiators on the trade side, led by Paolo Garzotti, for their engagement and transparent cooperation with the Parliament and with me as rapporteur. Special thanks to the Ambassador of Chile to the EU, Gloria Navarrete, and her embassy team for the wonderful cooperation we showed that trade can deliver for people. Let’s go.

Francisco Guerreiro,"Mr President, colleagues, Commissioner, the EU-Chile Association Agreement, in force since 2003, has significantly expanded bilateral trade, including in the agri-food sector, making our continent Chile’s third-largest trading partner. However, the trade deal now needs to be modernised in light of the changed geopolitical landscape. Therefore, we welcome the inclusion of the new sustainability provisions in the trade and sustainable development chapter, as well as the review clause to account for changing environmental and social standards, and for the first time, a dedicated chapter on trade and gender equality. To be noted also, the inclusion of a dedicated chapter on sustainable food systems that promotes bilateral and international cooperation, including provisions on animal welfare, in particular, mutual commitments to maintain the phase out of the use of antibiotics as growth promoters, in place in Chile since 2018. However, there are challenges to be met. We need to ensure that Chilean producers and exporters will apply the production standards equivalent to those of EU farmers on food and feed safety and quality, traceability, sustainability, animal welfare, and the use of veterinary, medicinal and phytosanitary products.

Željana Zovko,"Mr President, it’s very difficult to choose the language here because I’m talking to a Croatian diaspora who built Chile end of 19th century when Croats were not so competitive, and their agriculture and Dalmatia was suffering under high influence of import from Austro-Hungarian and Italian wine. And they couldn’t also adopt their shipyard. So, they have to go to look for another paradise and to work, and they went to Chile. They built Chile, they built wine industry and now they’re coming back. They’re coming back because they built this excellent country. That is a perfect example of how we should build our future relationship with someone who was chased from Europe at the time they were not competitive. So, thank you very much, Commissioner. Thank you for doing this after New Zealand to have and to build the bridges. And thank you, Gabriel Mato, for including our amendment that recognises the key role of Croatian diaspora and of all diaspora that was poor at the time and that the competitiveness was not a tool that we could have used, that we are using nowadays in order to have an equal position in the joint market.

Chile-EU relations can be a prime example for Europe to demonstrate how to create value chains with respect for highly sustainable and green quality jobs. The update of the agreements also serves us to improve Chilean governance, rule of law standards, fight against corruption and respect indigenous communities’ rights. Yet the lack of binding commitments is worrisome. It is now up to both the EU and Chile to prove to everyone in Latin America that trade and ties with Europe bring quality and prosperity, as well as respect for indigenous groups.",Greens/EFA,2024-02-29,2.

Clare Daly,"Mr President, much of the submarine cables that we’re so desperate to secure are not actually public infrastructure, but are private property owned by multinational consortia whose beneficial owners are mostly unknown, registered in tax havens or – like Google – have more than enough money anyway to fix a problem if something happens. And something happens regularly: 25% of cables are ruptured every single year by maritime activity, negligence and natural impacts. And nobody even notices because the traffic is simply rerouted. A report commissioned for the Security and Defence Committee – months after the Russian invasion of Ukraine – stated that there were no verified reports indicating deliberate attacks on the cable network by any actor, and that the large-scale scenario of complete lack of connectivity suggests a substantial risk of threat inflation. So is it not the case that this is just another part of the relentless drive to launder public money into the defence industry, this time underground? And what good would that do, considering the only actual explosion on the ground took place in a NATO heartland and nobody saw anything?",The Left,2024-02-29,4.

Seán Kelly,"Mr President, as a member of the Committee on International Trade, I welcome trade agreements. We have done quite a few in the last 10 or 15 years, which have been very positive for Europe because trade agreements are about win—win, and there are thousands and thousands of jobs created in Europe as a result of trade agreements. It is also very important that we diversify, in particular, in relation to critical raw materials. Lithium from Chile will be a big help in diversifying away from dependence on China, etcetera. Sustainability clauses are good, climate change is always very important, but there is a caveat. When my colleague Benoît here referred to agriculture, we have to be very careful of the overall impact of trade agreements on agriculture, and that’s why I think a sunset clause is very important to see how it’s impacting. If you have a continuous erosion of internal production, that’s not a good thing and that’s something we must monitor. Thankfully, Mercosur has fallen by the wayside. That would have been far worse.

Marc Angel,"Mr President, dear Commissioner, dear Ambassador, dear colleagues, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, the shadow rapporteurs and also the Chilean side for the good work done on this long-awaited file. This modernised EU-Chile agreement is of extreme political importance. Chile is a like-minded, a trustworthy and a reliable partner, and it is also important to underline that the EU relations with Chile are not only important for a few Member States, but they are important for the 27 Member States, for the Union as a whole. The agreement will finally deepen our relations and will create new opportunities for trade, jobs, investments in both regions, and I hope it will also enhance the people-to-people relation. Cooperation on access to raw materials and clean energy are crucial to tackle some of the most pressing current global challenges. Investment in competitive Chile and green hydrogen are an important opportunity for the European Union to promote decarbonisation and support our green transition. I am very glad to see a social dimension included into the agreement, with clear trade and sustainable development provisions, a gender chapter, binding commitments on labour rights and rights for indigenous people.

Samira Rafaela,"Mr President, dear colleagues, thank you for your opinions and comments. Look, this agreement, you have provisions in it, and these provisions are binding and enforceable with an enforcement mechanism. The political and cooperation pillar includes an entire chapter on cooperation on sustainable development, which contains comprehensive articles on sustainable development, particularly on the environment of climate change, sustainable energy and ocean governance. And the EU and Chile have taken clear commitments on effective implementation of ILO conventions and multilateral environmental agreements, coupled with a dedicated dispute settlement mechanism. So I’ve had this conversation many times with some of you in Parliament. First of all, stop spreading misinformation about the impact on our farmers or agriculture. Stop it! Do not act as if the Commission and Parliament do not have their facts straight. They have! After every single step that’s made in the negotiations, impact assessments and very strong analyses are being made constantly, after every single step that is being negotiated. Trade agreements are agreements where you negotiate for both and not only for yourself or for the EU. These negotiations, especially with Chile, have happened on an equal basis. So I also ask you then: what do you want? Do you really think we can produce our food only here in this continent? Or do you really think we can get our own critical materials? You want the energy transition, you want food on the table every evening, but you don’t want to trade. Do you prefer China then to take over every single continent in this world, and then act as if you don’t care? Because if you really care, you would be in favour of trade agreements that do offer values, that do offer human rights, instead of leaving it to countries that don’t care about human rights. So I suggest that we celebrate this very good step forward in reforming trade. You can’t have it perfect immediately, but you can have it very good the very first time. So it will be a very good example for future agreements. And I count on your support today.",Renew,2024-02-29,2.

Didier Reynders,"Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for putting the Commission’s proposal on the agenda of the plenary. Ensuring the availability of medical devices and in vitro diagnostics is key in a strong European Health Union. This proposal aims, primarily, to address the imminent risk of shortages of in vitro diagnostics. It pursues three objectives: to ensure the availability of high-risk in vitro diagnostics for health professionals and patients by extending the transition periods, subject to strict conditions; to enhance transparency and reduce administrative burden by enabling a gradual rollout of the European database on medical devices; to introduce an advance warning mechanism in case the supply of certain medical devices or in vitro diagnostics is interrupted. The aim of the advance warning is to enable competent authorities and health institutions to consider the mitigating measures that are needed to secure patient care. It is vital that this proposal is adopted in this mandate. Doing so will ensure it can deliver the impact we want and in a timely manner that we avoid critical shortages and safeguard patients’ safety. The Commission very much welcomes that, on 21 February, the Council signalled their willingness to endorse the Commission proposal without changes. The two medical device regulations are a step forward in our rulebook for medical devices. The process for deploying the new rules on the ground was and remains a challenging one, but we need to create the conditions for finishing it. The extended transitional periods are essential to safeguard patient care and we need them now. However, let me be clear with you: we still need a sustainable solution for the medium and long run. While the Commission is supporting the implementation of the rules through a significant number of non-legislative actions, we are also fully aware of the need for a structural assessment of the two regulations. That is why the Commission has begun working towards a targeted evaluation of the EU’s medical device legislation. Last week, we announced the plans for a targeted evaluation on the Commission’s Better Regulation portal. The Commission will examine how the regulations affect the availability of devices in the European Union, in particular, orphan devices and innovative devices. This was also suggested by the European Parliament in its report on non-communicable diseases of November 2023. We will also look at the cost and administrative burdens stemming from the implementation of the rules, especially for SMEs. The Commission is fully committed to this exercise and to finding sustainable solutions for the future, while safeguarding innovation and competitiveness of the medical device system in the European Union. Let me take this opportunity to thank you for your support and commitment to this process. The results of the evaluation will help us to identify where the real issues lie and thus set us on a path to finding the best solution to address these for patients and health systems, while promoting innovation.

Deirdre Clune,"Mr President, the objectives of the Medical Device Regulation are not being met. It was developed to ensure patient safety, to give confidence to patients and medical practitioners that necessary devices were safe and fit for purpose, which I absolutely support. But there are problems with certification that is resulting in pressure on the sector to ensure availability of these necessary devices. Of course, extending transitional periods are welcome, but this is not a permanent solution. It will not give confidence to the industry to keep innovating and to keep producing. We need structural reforms to the Medical Device Regulation if we are to see any lasting effect. The current regulatory system, marked by its slowness and complexity, demands urgent action for European patients. In the first 100 days of the next Commission, the Commission needs to bring forward a proposal to fix this problem, or we will be left with a situation where Europeans are left without life-saving devices.",PPE,2024-02-29,3.

Seán Kelly,"A Uachtaráin, obviously, it’s unacceptable that patients in Ireland and across the European Union have to wait long periods for life-saving medical aid of one kind or another. And if bureaucracy – and particularly European bureaucracy – is partly responsible for that, we have a duty to ensure that that is removed at the quickest possible speed. Also, as colleagues pointed out, we have to be very careful that we don’t drive companies out of Europe because of overregulation or not giving them the time to do the work they need to do, because innovation takes a lot of time, it isn’t always successful and we have to bear that in mind. But particularly, I think, as has been emphasised particularly by my colleague Deirdre Clune, as soon as the next Commission is up and running, they’ll have to do a complete overhaul of the regulations here, remove the unnecessary bureaucracy, and ensure that innovations can take place and also that patients will get the medical aid they need as quickly as possible. That has to be done and it shouldn’t be beyond our remit. (Ukončenie vystúpení podľa postupu prihlásenia sa o slovo zdvihnutím ruky)",PPE,2024-02-29,3.

Bart Groothuis,"Mr President, Commissioner, I checked: it’s my 12th speech in this Parliament on the security of subsea infrastructure. So you might conclude I’m obsessed with it. But I guarantee you there’s someone even more obsessed with it and his name is Vladimir Putin. NATO and individual countries – like Tom Berendsen just said – are already operationally active to start countering Putin’s sabotage capabilities. And last week, the European Commission put forward a good plan – finally, I must say – to help protect our subsea infrastructure. Thank you! But I ask you to focus only on the things that the EU does best, and leave the rest to NATO or individual Member States. First, make sure that Russian and Chinese companies are excluded from commercial projects connecting Europe with internet cables. I ask for binding rules so that they can be enforced by the European Commission. Secondly, actively increase the connectivity of our continent with the rest of the world so sabotage will be less effective and consumer prices will be lower. Thirdly, create joint European subsea capabilities. Start by setting a standard for a European repair ship, for example, and build it. Set a standard for coast guard vessels; jointly build them; set the standards and do it. Buy them; set up a joint programme around it for joint information sharing, joint response, joint mitigation. Plant a flag by building concrete capabilities. I’ve seen plenty of strategy. Now let’s see the execution because with the current threat, execution is the strategy.",Renew,2024-02-29,4.

Ciarán Cuffe,"Mr President, if our cables go down, our economy goes down. Undersea cables between Ireland and Europe are increasingly important for our economies and our communications and our energy supplies. Some 90% of Ireland’s territory is underwater. Pipelines, electricity and data cables traverse this space, and offshore wind installations are increasing. We must ensure that all of this critical infrastructure is protected. In 2022, the Russian Ministry of Defence proposed exercises over vital cables off the Irish coast. While this proposal was rescinded, it highlighted a key vulnerability. If our defence forces are to effectively defend the state against new hybrid threats, their budget must be upgraded. This will help plug the gaping holes in our ability to identify who or what traverses our sea and sky. We must work with our neighbours in the future to ensure that this infrastructure, which is critical for Ireland and the European Union, is protected. I welcome the Commission’s recommendations that we should regularly assess and improve the security and resilience of existing and new submarine cables infrastructure. And I believe that Ireland should participate in the PESCO Critical Maritime Infrastructure Protection project, in continued alignment with the state’s neutrality position. Bad actors still populate the international stage and, as long as they do, Ireland has a duty to ensure it can defend while also working peacefully to oppose them.",Greens/EFA,2024-02-29,4.

Sophia in 't Veld,"Mr President, Commissioner, it’s a pity, actually, that the Council is absent. It would have been a very educational debate for them, I suppose. First of all, I would like to start by welcoming the annual report – the edition that we are discussing today. I think the next one is already in the making. And having been one of the driving forces behind it – the author actually of the legislative initiative proposal at the time for the annual report – I am very pleased to see that it is year on year developing into a very useful instrument, not least in connection with the Conditionality Regulation. However, if everything were fine, then we would have a very short debate. So I would like to express a couple of recommendations and concerns, nevertheless. First, on horizontal remarks, on the method – and we’ve had this exchange many times before so you are aware of the position of the European Parliament – we consider that further changes are needed. We need this report to become even more independent from the Member States. If we read the report of the European Commission, it is still fairly mild in describing situations which in reality are actually extremely worrying. I mean, if you read the report of the Commission, you think, okay, there are some concerns in the European Union, but it’s all under control. Whereas if you look at the overall picture, I’m a lot more worried than that. And I think if you use the sources outside your national interlocutors, the government interlocutors, then the picture is somewhat more grim. We have also repeatedly called for this report to be part of an interinstitutional agreement. And I find it very disappointing that the proposal of the European Parliament and the Commission to have cooperation with the Council on this topic – even in the shape of a pilot project – is being rejected by the Member States. I mean, that tells you something about the spirit in which they see this annual rule of law cycle. And finally, we also feel that the report would gain in strength and credibility if it’s drawn up by a panel of independent experts. Just this week, the European Court of Auditors has issued a report on the rule of law toolkit. It also includes some remarks on this report. And I think some of the remarks underline what I’ve just said. Secondly, in implementing or upholding the rule of law, neutrality vis-à-vis the Member States is key. And that was actually the reason behind this whole report – that all Member States will be measured by the same yardstick. And here I see a risk. I think that, contrary to what some people in Hungary might claim, any decision of the European Commission to intervene is not politically motivated. However, I sometimes detect some political motivation behind the decision not to intervene because there are some countries that would definitely justify an intervention. Finally, I think there are a couple of horizontal issues that we’ve addressed: independence of the judiciary, safety and freedom of journalists, the fight against corruption, the creation of equality bodies and such issues. But I would like to conclude with one issue that is particularly topical today. Today we are remembering the train crash at Tempe in Greece one year ago, which is very closely connected to corruption: a rail safety system that was not put in place because of reasons of fraud and corruption, which had been detected by the European Public Prosecutor, but not by the national authorities and not by the Commission. So you can see how corruption and fraud can literally cost lives. And therefore I think we should step up the fight against corruption even more.",Renew,2024-02-28,15.

Didier Reynders,"Monsieur le Président, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, je suis d'abord heureux d'avoir cet échange de vues avec vous sur le rapport annuel de la commission sur l'état de droit. Cela devient maintenant un cycle habituel de débats au sein de votre assemblée. L'un des objectifs du rapport est précisément de servir de base pour de tels débats politiques et je me réjouis de souligner que nous avons largement atteint cet objectif déjà avec les trois éditions précédentes. Le rapport fait régulièrement l'objet de débats, tant ici au Parlement européen qu'au sein des parlements nationaux ou au sein du Conseil. Le rapport a également suscité des discussions internes au sein des États membres sur l'état de droit et sur les mesures qui peuvent être prises pour le renforcer. Le rapport permet aussi d'améliorer la connaissance mutuelle des systèmes nationaux respectifs. Il sert désormais de référence aux États membres lorsqu'ils engagent des réformes, notamment sur la base des recommandations émises dans les rapports de 2022 et 2023. – Allow me to also recall President von der Leyen’s announcement in the State of the Union speech that the Commission will open the 2024 Rule of Law Report to some enlargement countries. I am pleased to inform you that the Commission has invited Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia to participate in the exercise for 2024. These four countries have been invited, as they are the most advanced either in their respective accession process or concerning the level of preparedness when it comes to the rule of law. This is thus the countries for which Chapter 23 on the rule of law and fundamental rights, and Chapter 24 on justice, freedom and security, are open or which are above some level of preparation when it comes to Chapter 23. The Commission welcomes the draft resolution we are debating today on the fourth edition of the Rule of Law Report, which was adopted in July last year. As you know, the Rule of Law Report covers four pillars: the independence, quality and efficiency of justice systems; anti-corruption frameworks; media freedom and pluralism; and all the institutional checks and balances there are. These are key independent pillars for ensuring the rule of law. The draft resolution welcomes the focus on these key areas. As regards the specific topics covered under each area, the Commission is following up on the challenges and developments identified in the previous report, deepening our assessment in certain areas or adding new topics that emerge across Member States, as relevant. For example, the 2023 report systematically looks at public service media and at the implementation of judgements of the European Court of Human Rights, topics that were raised also by the European Parliament. The functioning of national checks and balances in how Member States responded to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the use of intrusive surveillance software such as Pegasus, are also part of the report, where relevant. Furthermore, the Commission has also taken due note of your request to cover the cooperation with the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, which is already mentioned in the Rule of Law Report. The economic dimension of the rule of law is an important issue, as respect for the rule of law is essential for the correct application of EU law and for a well-functioning single market. Judicial and anti-corruption reforms, in particular, can have an important impact on the business environment, as already often highlighted in the European Semester reports. Rule of law reforms are also part of many Member States’ national recovery and resilience plans. Last but not least, they are essential for the protection of the EU’s financial interests. Your draft report recognises the Commission’s efforts to engage with civil society. You also call on the Commission to work closer with the Fundamental Rights Agency in the context of the rule of law cycle. In this respect, I am pleased to flag that in follow up to the 2023 report, we continued to hold national rule of law dialogues, organised jointly with the Fundamental Rights Agency and directly involving national civil society in a number of Member States. We intend to extend these dialogues further. We managed to gradually advance the date of adoption each year since the second report, whilst also extending, each year, the consultation period for the Member States and other stakeholders. The 2023 report presents the Commission assessment based on a well-established methodology and showing objectivity and equal treatment among Member States. Our assessment is also informed by a variety of sources, but I confirm that is the assessment of the Commission, and it is the role of the Commission to do that, so we will continue to work in such a way. For the 2023 report, and in direct response to requests from the Parliament and civil society, we have also taken steps to increase the transparency and inclusiveness of all joint work even further. We are now publishing additional information about the calendar of the exercise, including, more specifically, the schedule for the country visits for 2024. In addition, we now provide more information on the composition, role and meetings of the network of national rule of law contact points. As you know, the report has evolved throughout these four years since the beginning of my mandate. Since 2022, it includes country-specific recommendations addressed to each Member State. The aim of these recommendations is to assist and support Member States in their efforts to take forward reforms. The 2023 report assessed the follow-up given to the first set of recommendations that the Commission issued in the year before. We can see that the report has become a true driver of positive reforms. Important efforts are ongoing in many Member States to follow up on the recommendations of the previous year. This is, however, happening at various speeds and levels of completeness, with some important concerns remaining in certain Member States. Overall, within this framework of one year, around two thirds of the recommendations issued in 2022 have already been followed up fully or partially. The 2023 recommendations either build on last year’s recommendations where there was no or partial implementation, or address new challenges identified since last year. We are now preparing this through the fifth edition of the annual Rule of Law Report that we plan to adopt at the beginning of July this year. In fact, since the end of January, we have been in an intensive phase of the virtual country visits, meeting and engaging with another average three Member States per week. So, I am sure that we will continue to intensify the work with the Member States, the stakeholders, the civil society in such a way to have a real possibility to promote the culture of the rule of law in all the Member States. But it is true that if it is not enough to organise a dialogue on such a basis, on the basis of the report, it is needed to do more, and we are using all the tools like infringement proceedings, sometimes with some decision requests to the court to import some fines. But also, we are using the budgetary instruments that we have at our disposal. You know that you have put a lot of reforms in the recovery and resilience plans, with some milestones in those plans concerning the fight against corruption or the reforms concerning the justice system to give some examples. In one case, we have used also the conditionality mechanism. Thank you for your support in the way to organise the process with all those instruments. But also thank you for such a debate about the rule of law report. Again, it is an important element to promote the culture of the rule of law in the entire European Union.",-,2024-02-28,15.

Cyrus Engerer,"Mr President, populism, disinformation, lack of transparency, and the weakening of institutions and procedures are putting the rule of law and democracy under threat in the European Union. And I urge this House to keep on defending democracy, keep on defending human rights and keep on defending the rule of law as a key priority in the next mandate after June, because European citizens depend on their representatives, both at national level and European level, especially when those in power think that popularity absolves them from respecting the rule of law, defending democracy or from protecting human rights. Because in a democracy, popularity should never make anyone believe that they are above the law, or that they could decide which fundamental rights citizens could enjoy. I thank the Commission for once again taking this positive step to look at the situation in each and every Member State. However, I would like to see this procedure happening in a more independent way, rather than relying on Member States having an independent panel which evaluates each and every Member State. And I also would like to see the Commission, as a guarantor of the treaties, to have concrete and speedy actions, to enforce the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights. Because what we have seen happening with Hungary, for instance, and the conditionality mechanism, is shameful on the Commission. We can never stress enough that democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights are the foundations on which everything else is based on. It is in this light that I cannot but show my disappointment at how our President herself failed to take this message and the resolution adopted by this House to Greece, and pretend that there are no issues, where – I remind – government was tapping politicians and journalists, there are systematic flaws in the rule of law in Greece, and where a journalist has been assassinated and until today, there is total impunity. To conclude, I would like to encourage citizens and civil societies, all European universities and students, human rights defenders to engage in critical thinking, to lead strong democratic revolutions. Some want critical thinking to be seen as a crime. Some political forces are trying to control the media, leading to a situation where pluralism or independent reporting becomes less and less possible. Do not allow this to happen.

Balázs Hidvéghi,"Mr President, dear colleagues, as we are coming near to the end of this mandate, it’s perhaps a good idea to reflect upon what’s so wrong with this rule of law bandwagon. The approach used by the Commission and this Parliament is fundamentally flawed in principle. For instance, matters relating to life and death, family, marriage, or the upbringing of our children, stem from norms dating back thousands of years. They are also closely linked to religious beliefs and our attitudes towards the supernatural. Evidently, these topics are sensitive and they can be divisive. It is certainly not the prerogative of this House to decide upon these crucial ethical issues. The sovereign decision about them remains with Member States, in line with their national constitutions, traditions and convictions. Different opinions and different conclusions on some of these things are possible, and they should be respected. It is utterly wrong to disguise political and moral debates as if they were legal ones, and to sanction those who continue to defend traditional values. Brussels should stop the aggressive promotion of a radically left wing ideology and worldview, because this destroys good European cooperation.",NI,2024-02-28,15.

Kadri Simson,"Mr President, honourable Members of Parliament, first of all, I would like to present my sincere condolences to the families and friends of the workers who lost their lives and the ones who were injured in an accident at a supermarket construction site on 16 February in Florence. This should never have happened. It is a tragedy. It is not acceptable that workers die while they are working. In the European Union, all workers are entitled to a healthy and safe work environment, a right guaranteed by Article 31 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Improving health and safety at work has been an important issue for the EU since the 1980s, and a lot has been achieved. The existing EU legislation and measures for the safety and health of workers have contributed to an overall reduction of about 70 % fatal work accidents between 1994 and 2021. However, despite this considerable improvement, a number of deaths at work continue to occur, as we have just seen with this accident at work in Florence. In general, the construction sector is regularly the economic activity sector with the highest number of fatal accidents per year in the EU. In 2021, the latest year for which data is available at EU level, 741 or over 20 % of fatal accidents in all economic sectors happened in the construction sector. Every accident, every death at work is one death to many. This is why, for Commissioner Schmit, who I am replacing today, occupational safety and health has been at the forefront and the Commission has set a very ambitious objective to address the situation. For the first time, a ‘vision zero’ approach to work-related death was introduced by the current EU Strategic Framework on Health and Safety at Work. Our vision is to end all accidents and diseases caused by work. This requires that efforts are deployed by all actors for reaching this goal. The Commission is actively working towards this goal and made substantial progress to pursue this ambitious approach. For example, in January this year, the Senior Labour Inspectors’ Committee launched an EU-wide inspection and enforcement campaign in which all Member States take part. We are also progressing on the review of the practical implementation of the directives in the health and safety at work area. This review is planned to be finalised by the end of next year. The European Agency for Safety and Health at Work supports the work of the Commission by providing practical tools and information for companies on how to protect their workers and prevent work accidents in the construction sector. Up to now, there exist more than 20 online interactive risk assessment tools for the construction sector in different EU Member States. Honourable Members, no one should die at work. I count on you to continue to work in this direction.",-,2024-02-28,19.

Tineke Strik,"Mr President, dear Commissioner, the latest Rule of Law Report shows a serious pressure on the rule of law in many EU countries. The Annual Report is supposed to be the key to unlocking the EU’s rule of law toolbox, but far too often, this toolbox remains closed. The numerous concerns described in the Report are not followed with infringement actions, interim measures, steps in Article 7 proceedings, or budgetary conditionality measures. I welcome the country-specific recommendations, but we need to see more strategy. Please differentiate between incidental and systematic breaches, expand the scope and cover all the EU’s fundamental values, including democracy and fundamental rights, and ensure an effective follow-up and enforcement. Mr President, rule of law is the cornerstone of our Union; we cannot afford to dialogue and see what happens.

Sophia in 't Veld,"Mr President, Commissioner. I will very rapidly respond to some points and cover some countries. First of all on Hungary, there is no need to say very much; it’s in a league of its own. I think that President von der Leyen’s decision to release the EUR 10 billion was spectacularly misguided, but I’m glad to hear that no payments have been made yet. Greece and Slovakia are, as far as I’m concerned, the two most worrying situations at the moment. With regard to Spain, the report states very clearly that the amnesty law merits an independent assessment, and we are happy that the Spanish Senate has requested an opinion by the Venice Commission. The stalemate with regard to the General Council of the Judiciary must be resolved urgently, but I would also like to underline that the underlying problem in Spain, in my view, is not a legal one, but a profoundly political one, and it has to be resolved through political dialogue. Malta still merits our attention, and Italy is getting into the danger zone. I am referring specifically to freedom of the media and equal rights. Poland, Slovenia and Bulgaria seem to be positive examples, but extremely complex and fragile. Poland, in particular, shows us how rebuilding the rule of law from rubble is extremely difficult. There are also specific, but not systemic issues in other countries, such as excessive police violence or the maltreatment of migrants. As regards spyware, this is a huge threat to democracy, and the Commission’s refusal to act has turned Europe into a spyware Wild West. I am very worried by the lack of response from this House to last week’s highly alarming revelations that Pegasus spyware had once again been found on the phones of MEPs, and we treat it as if that is normal. As a final remark, I would like to clarify to some colleagues, in particular those with close ties to the Kremlin, if you think that you can offend me by calling me a liberal, you’re wrong.

Nadia Calviño Santamaría,"Monsieur le Président, merci beaucoup à tous ces honorables parlementaires qui sont ici et qui nous accompagnent, ainsi qu’aux représentants de la Commission européenne. It is a great honour and a pleasure for me to address this House for the first time as President of the European Investment Bank Group. I was recently in the European Parliament representing the Spanish Presidency of the Council and at that time, I already said how happy I was to see so many known faces, so many friends, so many colleagues and partners. In the eight weeks since I took the job as President of the European Investment Bank Group, I have been engaging with the different stakeholders. I met President Metsola last week. Today, we signed a memorandum of understanding to cooperate in the communication to European citizens in the run up to the European elections and deepening our cooperation, in particular with the European Parliament, will be one of my top priorities going forward. I would like to wholeheartedly thank the rapporteur, Mr Cormand, and the shadow rapporteurs, for their excellent work. I think this resolution that you’re voting today is extremely valuable and timely and the European Investment Bank Group and the European Parliament can count on each other – as strategic partners can – to ensure that we continue to support key European programmes that are of the essence if we want the bank to deploy its full potential in financing the investments that Europe needs. Programmes such as InvestEU, the NDICI, yesterday’s approval of the Ukraine facility, the STEP programme – all of these are key guarantees and support programmes from the European budget that allow the EIB to leverage, to mobilise private investment and to close the investment gap for the twin green and digital transitions. Last week, I had the chance to address European finance ministers and exchange with them our key priorities going forward. My priorities were very strongly supported by them, the first of which is obviously to consolidate our role as Europe’s climate bank. Gearing up investment in adaptation, mitigation and the energy transition is the top priority for the European Investment Bank and that has to do with the rollout of renewables, but also the manufacturing of net-zero technologies inside the EU and financing new cutting-edge technologies. We will work on a new water programme to support countries at the forefront of the impact of climate change and also a programme to support SMEs in Europe, gearing up investment in new, energy-efficient and economically profitable technologies. Our second priority will be accelerating digitalisation and technological innovation. It is clear that cutting-edge technologies and putting Europe at the forefront of this technological race is of the essence going forward and so we will support a new programme, a faster programme, a fund for the acceleration of strategic technologies and economic resilience. This means net-zero technologies, but also chips, artificial intelligence, life science, advanced materials, critical raw materials. Third priority: stepping up investment in security and defence. It is quite clear that Europe needs to step up its capabilities in the area of security and defence industries. We are already investing in this area. For the past eight years, we have supported projects regarding R&D, new technologies, critical infrastructures, cyber security, space, dual-use technologies and equipment. This means investing in drones, border protection systems. I know these are two of the key priorities to frontline countries. The Strategic European Security Initiative was upgraded to EUR 8 billion only last year. Only EUR 2 billion have been invested so far. The European Investment Fund launched, in January, a new EUR 175 million programme – the European Defence Equity Initiative – to support SMEs and start-ups in this field and we are ready to do more and better to contribute to joint projects that boost European industry and reinforce our capacity to protect and also our deterrents vis- à-vis third countries. I very much welcome the support that President von der Leyen gave here today to this approach. Our fourth priority is contributing to a modern cohesion policy. This is within the EIB’s DNA. It is not only the right policy, it is also the smart thing to do if we want opportunities to be where talent is. Talent is equally distributed throughout the whole EU, but opportunities are not. And we have a key role to play to ensure that carbon competitiveness and cohesion are inseparable elements to ensure that the green transition is a European success. Fifth priority: developing innovative financing for agriculture and the bioeconomy, possibly exploring gearing up insurance and de-risking schemes for these key areas for the European economy. Our sixth priority going forward would be gearing up investment in social infrastructure and this includes education, skills of course, health and affordable housing. These are key infrastructures and we want inclusive growth, sustainable growth and also increasing Europe’s growth potential. Seventh priority: pioneering the capital markets union, the European Investment Bank Group can pull together other financial institutions to build the building blocks of a true, deep and broad capital markets union, pioneering European-wide financial instruments to that effect. And last but not least, we need to focus our activity outside the EU on our strategic priorities. Support to Ukraine is obviously a top priority. The recent adoption of the Ukraine facility, the EU4U facility, are being extremely helpful. Together with the EBRD and other key financial players and national governments, we want to continue to support Ukraine now and to contribute to its rebuilding once the war is over as soon as possible, I hope. Then, a successful enlargement process, support to our neighbourhood, focusing actions in Africa, Latin America and Asia in supporting the Global Gateway initiative. This will be one of our top priorities going forward to reinforce Europe’s voice in the world. Ladies and gentlemen, to sum up, the European Investment Bank Group – the financing arm of the EU – is investing in Europe’s future. It is investing in our shared future. These priorities are closely interlinked. They’re targeting key challenges. They’re fully aligned with European policies. They are fully aligned with the priorities that have been flagged by the European Parliament and that are summed up in the statement and the report that will be voted today and aim at closing the investment gap related to the twin green and digital transitions, strengthening Europe’s cohesion and competitiveness, our strategic autonomy, our security and resilience. And I am really looking forward to working closely with the European Parliament and the European Commission going forward to further strengthen our ability to respond to the citizens’ expectations.",-,2024-02-28,13.

Nadia Calviño Santamaría,"Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, dear Commissioner, thank you very much. Five points from my side. First of all, to thank you for your statements and ideas, for the support and the trust that the vast majority of the persons and the groups in this Parliament have shown for the European Investment Bank Group. Also, thank you very much for your suggestions on how we can improve our contribution to European policies. You have mentioned words such as competitiveness, economic security, re-industrialisation, mobilising and catalysing private investment, the climate change and the green transition. All of these elements are within our strategic priorities, as testified by our investments in 2023 and the results that are included in your report. So thank you very much. Second point is also to thank the European Commission for its mandate. As you rightly pointed out, throughout the guarantees and mandates coming from the European budget agreed by all European institutions – and I know very well how important the role is of the European Parliament in getting those funds to fund the mandates and the guarantees – we have European successes. Joint successes like InvestEU, it has been mentioned, to fund strategic investment to fund the European industry; the NDICI, the core of our external action in our neighbourhood and beyond. So, going forward, keeping those mandates and guarantees will be absolutely indispensable if we want the European Investment Bank Group to continue to leverage the funds, the capital and the European budget, mobilising public and private investment and thus closing the investment gap and making all these transitions a European success. My third point is to thank wholeheartedly also Mr Fernandes and Ms Győri; they have mentioned SMEs and this is at the core of the mandate, not only of the bank but also very especially of the European Investment Fund. We have been not only providing financing and supporting European SMEs, but also scaling up startups and supporting European strategic technologies so that these startups can remain in Europe and do not have to go abroad to get the necessary financing to grow as fast as possible. SMEs are at the heart of our economic tissue, and we are strongly committed to contributing and to continue to develop innovative financial instruments to provide support to these companies and allow them to also benefit from the green and digital transition. My fourth point has to do with cohesion and social infrastructures. Both Mr Papadimoulis, Mr Fernández, you have stressed how important it is to ensure that our policies and our investments get to those parts of Europe that are less rich, less developed. Almost half of our financing inside the EU last year went to these regions. And this is, as I explained in my introductory remarks, not only fair, not only just not only correct, it is also smart if we want to continue to have strong growth and prosperity throughout the whole EU. A fourth important point made by Mr. Goerens, Mr Heinäluoma, Ms Yon-Courtin and also by Mr Wallace, in a very different sense, has to do with security and defence. If we do not have security we cannot have prosperity, we cannot defend our mode of life, we cannot defend our shared values. That is why it is important at this point in time and this geopolitical context, to step up our activities and our support for European industry in the areas of security and defence. For the past eight years, the EIB Group has been supporting the European security and defence industry. We have put in place the strategic programme with up to EUR 8 billion. We have mobilised innovative financing with this new defence equity facility managed by the European Investment Fund. Here, we are talking about defence. And when we’re talking about defence, we’re talking about drones, we’re talking about new technologies, we’re talking about ports for our navies. It is air transport capabilities for our airborne forces, it is border protection, it is satellites that can be used for civil objectives, but also by militaries. It is cyber security against Russian attacks. It is space, where the European Investment Bank is amongst the biggest financiers in Europe already. That is why we had a very important exchange with European finance ministers last Friday and we agreed two concrete takeaways. To engage with the European Commission and other stakeholders on the definition and scope of dual use; I will report back in two months’ time to European finance ministers on where we are in this definition. Secondly, to work together to accelerate the investment of the EUR 6 billion remaining under this facility, providing streamlined processes and also a single window, so as to facilitate the investments that are necessary at this point in time. Our security also has to do with supporting Ukraine at this point in time, no doubt about it. That is why when we are talking about actions outside the EU, we are also supporting the efforts of this country right now and will, I hope, very soon, engage in mobilising private investment for the reconstruction of the country. A final point on climate. Mr Polčák, Mr Cormand, of course, and many others have mentioned the importance of Europe making the green transition a success. That is why we have been investing in all key technologies for the green transition. Ms Benjumea and others have spoken about some specific technologies. Let me be very clear: the European Investment Bank has been financing net-zero technologies in the past. We have been investing in R&D, in the fuel cycle, in security. Only some weeks ago, we financed more than EUR 100 million in Romania to ensure the recovery of tritium, a nuclear fuel. We do this hand in hand with Euratom, so fully aligned with European policies. That is what we will continue to do, supporting R&D and all technologies that are playing a key role in the green transition, with a very special emphasis on renewables, which is obviously our top priority and where the European Investment Bank Group is already playing a very important role. Let me close here, thanking you again for this very productive exchange and looking forward to deepening our cooperation in the coming years.",-,2024-02-28,13.

Clare Daly,"Mr President, the European Investment Bank has approved loans of EUR 650 million for Israeli infrastructure since the launch of its latest genocidal attack in Gaza. To give you an idea of the scale of what that represents, it’s the equivalent of 90 % of the EIB’s total investment in Palestine since its first loan in 1995. From 1995 to date, it’s invested more than EUR 2 billion in Israel, compared to EUR 725 million in Palestine. At the same time, we’ve seen countless examples of Israel destroying EU-funded projects with impunity in the West Bank, assets worth hundreds of thousands of euros, funded by countries like Ireland, being routinely destroyed by settlers. You’ve even managed to approve a loan to Israeli’s Leumi Bank for EUR 240 million in December, the same bank which has frozen UNRWA bank accounts. I’m wondering at this stage as to whether you’re actually complicit in genocide. (End of catch-the-eye procedure)",The Left,2024-02-28,13.

Mick Wallace,"Mr President, it’s often forgotten that the European Union was founded primarily as a means to prevent future wars. The European Investment Bank was established in the 1958 Treaty of Rome with a mission to facilitate equitable development in the EU through lending to regions that are less developed and to support the EU’s internal market. The EIB’s current mission statement is to boost Europe’s potential in terms of jobs and growth, support action to mitigate climate change and promote EU policies outside the EU. Yesterday, however, the EIB president said the bank was ready to do more and better to contribute to projects which boost the European defence industry. Can anyone tell me how a bank with a mission statement to facilitate equitable development throughout EU Member States can justify committing funding to defence industry to the tune of EUR 8 billion? It’s worrying to hear that the EIB president says that supporting the US/NATO proxy war in Ukraine is a priority now. This is turning into a money laundering exercise for the military industrial complex.

Kadri Simson,"Mr President, honourable Members, dear colleagues from the EIB, I would like to welcome this report and thank Parliament’s Committee on Budgets and in particular its rapporteur, David Cormand. The EIB Group has been instrumental in the implementation of the EU policies inside and outside the Union, from its support to the Green Deal, to the rollout of Global Gateway and in the deployment of InvestEU. In the current tense geopolitical circumstances, the EIB’s stronger involvement and support of EU strategic priorities is indispensable. As we look ahead, there are a few points I want to highlight. First, the EU’s competitiveness: we need to strengthen the EU’s competitive edge, and we need the EU’s bank to work closely with us to make it happen. Innovative start-ups and scale-ups are key to Europe’s future economy and society. Both the EIB and the EIF are well placed to help create a favourable investment environment, provide venture capital, and catalyse public and private funding. I appreciate the rapporteur’s focus on the importance of the EIF, particularly its role in enabling SMEs to scale up their operations. To highlight, the number of EIF-supported SMEs throughout 2023 amounted to 350 000. Competitiveness must go hand-in-hand with green and digital transitions. The EIB, as the EU’s investment bank and climate bank, is at the forefront of climate financing, and I welcome that. In 2023, more than half of the EIB’s financing was deployed for climate and environmental sustainability objectives. The EIB contributed to REPowerEU and the recent approval of EUR 5 billion in support of our wind power package are worthy examples to be mentioned. In view of new and emerging risks, the EIB Group has a large role to play in strengthening our economic security. The EIB Group should also adapt and step up its support to foster research and development of the EU industrial base in such strategic areas as advanced semiconductors, quantum computing, biotechnology, net-zero industries, clean energy and critical raw materials. Second, let me recall the impressive role of the EIB Group in implementing our flagship investment programme, InvestEU. The implementation is well on track, and I am happy to see that the EIB and the EIF are generating many operations under InvestEU to support the EU priorities of overall resilience of the EU economy. Third, EIB activities outside the EU: the Global Gateway strategy is a geopolitical project to position the EU in a competitive international marketplace, while supporting our partner countries in responding to their investment needs. In 2023, we have worked hard with the EIB to implement EFSD+, the financial arm of NDICI – Global Europe, resulting in around EUR 3.7 billion in EIB financing against EUR 2.5 billion in 2022. The EIB should continue supporting the rollout of the strategy in line with EU priorities such as sustainable connectivity, boosting security of global supply chains, and facilitating clean and digital transitions. At the same time, EIB intervention should be focused on where it brings the highest additionality and added value both for our partner countries and the EU. Fourth, I have to highlight the EIB’s role in Ukraine. It will be important to gradually increase EIB operating capacity and to prioritise investments in line with the Ukraine plan. With the anticipated imminent approval of the EUR 50 billion Ukraine Facility, the EIB is expected to play a major role in implementing its investment pillar. I expect the EIB to coordinate closely with other implementing partners to ensure high complementarity and best possible delivery. Fifth, Russia’s war dramatically changed the security paradigm here in Europe. We need to increase our defence readiness and this requires a joint effort, including from the EIB. We cannot ignore the geopolitical threats and the needs of Ukraine and the EU to defend itself. I particularly welcome the Defence Equity Facility established with the EIF, which is a first step in support of innovative companies developing technologies with dual-use applications. While we support the EIB commitment to reach EUR 8 billion by 2027 in financing to defence and security, further efforts should be taken to assist the European defence industry in line with the latest Ecofin discussions.",-,2024-02-28,13.

That would mean less fragmentation of our capital markets and more start-ups able to scale up.

Lara Wolters,"Mr President, so, European companies have the right to exploit children, they have the right to destroy forests and, most of all, European companies have the right not to ask any questions or right any wrongs. To be very clear, this is not what I think. This is what Emmanuel Macron, Giorgia Meloni and Christian Lindner have fought for together over the past weeks. And if I sound angry now, it’s because I am. We had a deal, but business lobbies would not give up and here we are. These leaders have now become convinced that accountability is a burden and human rights are a nice-to-have. For them, fair competition is speaking big words about European norms and values, and then encouraging a cut-throat race to the bottom. The European way of life, well apparently, that’s the European right to wealth at the expense of others. The cynicism of today’s developments, the shamelessness, the outrageous injustice of big business lobbies who tell their political leaders what to do instead of the other way round.

The main drivers are employment of new technologies, increased competitiveness of Asian economies, a decline in global trade as well as decarbonisation. This is completely changing level playing field for the factories. We did well in setting the policies, setting the predictable rules and the targets, but so far, we failed to support the transformation of the economy and the businesses, and obviously secure some financial support. Instead of having EU VAT single market consistent tax policies or financial support policies, we are going for relaxation of the rules and a fragmented policy, and this is far from being optimal. At the same time, our firms are still facing heavy regulation and fragmented rules. I guess competitiveness must become quickly a number one topic of EU, together with the security.

Gunnar Beck,"Mr President, in 2008, the EU economy was still noticeably larger than that of the US. Today, the US economy is more than a third larger. Year on year, the gap is widening because growth paths have been diverging. Even struggling post-Brexit Britain is easily outperforming Germany and France. So, why is Europe so manifestly and collectively failing? First, because of the Green Deal which assumes that the EU, with a share of about 8% of worldwide CO2 emissions, can singlehandedly limit global warming. The Green Deal is saving nothing, but it will certainly make poor people even poorer. Secondly, an inflationary monetary policy which sustains a vicious spiral of stagflation. Third, self-defeating sanctions and the dumbest energy policy in the world, which harm us more than Russia and which have replaced Germany’s dependence on cheap Russian gas with dependency on high-price Russian energy re-exported via India or Azerbaijan. Fourth, a truly fantastical migration policy which relies on unqualified mass migration as a replacement for tens of millions of native skilled labourers on the verge of retirement. The result of this suicidal policy mix, I sadly but confidently predict, will be the collapse both of the European economies and of our welfare states. Europe’s decline is often compared to that of the Roman Empire, but Rome declined over five centuries and was undermined by all-too-human decadence and overwhelmed by external forces. Modern Europe, by contrast, is experiencing the strangest death ever. It’s the first intentionally de-developing civil civilisation, both intellectually and economically. We have lost faith in everything except the woke ideology, which is defying the laws of nature, of scientific inquiry and of economic progress all at once.

Kadri Simson,"Madam President, honourable Members, although the comeback of wolves is good news for biodiversity in Europe, the Commission fully acknowledges the complexities of the current situation. Wolves are returning to regions of the Union from which they have long been absent. Increasingly, this is leading to conflict and challenges for some stakeholders and especially for livestock farmers, because of increasing depredation and killing of livestock. For that reason, on 20 December last year, in line with the commitment we made and in response to the resolution passed by this House, the Commission published an in-depth analysis on the situation of the wolves in the EU. It contains, inter alia, the most up-to-date data available for wolf populations and damage to livestock. Our analysis confirmed that after a long period of persecution, leading to near extinction, European wolf populations have made a significant recovery. This has been especially noteworthy in the last two decades and wolves now occupy large areas of their former natural range. On the basis of this in-depth analysis, the Commission tabled a proposal for a Council decision on the same day, asking the Union to submit them an amendment to the Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats. The proposed amendment would move the wolf from Appendix 2 – that means strictly protected species – to Appendix 3. The proposal for a Council decision is now under consideration by Member States under the leadership of the Belgian Presidency. The Commission is looking forward to a swift decision on this proposal. At the same time, the Commission continues to urge local and national authorities to take appropriate action wherever necessary, as permitted by the derogation possibilities in the current legislation. Several Member States make regular use of such derogations to authorise lethal control of wolf specimens and specimens of other protected species as well. As stressed by the Commission on several occasions, it is key to keep investing in damage prevention measures. Indeed, irrespective of any decision on the legal status of the wolf, it will always be essential to adopt prevention measures in order to reduce livestock depredation. More and more Member States are now using the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development to programme support for damage prevention actions and investments. For the period 2023-27, 15 Member States have included relevant measures in their CAP strategic plans, bringing tangible solutions to farmers and local communities. And as permitted under EU State aid rules, many Member States now provide full compensation to farmers whenever damage is caused by the wolf or other protected species. To achieve our common objectives, I would like to recall the recommendations that Commissioner Sinkevičius and Commissioner Wojciechowski have sent to all Member States in November 2021, inviting them to make the best possible use of all the available EU and national funding opportunities. The support from the Commission will continue. We are stepping up financial support as well as our help to national authorities and stakeholders to find suitable solutions to facilitate this coexistence, in line with EU legislation and policy goals.",-,2024-02-28,22.

According to Index on Censorship, a UK-based watchdog: ‘We are not aware of members of any other Irish party taking a comparable number of concurrent cases against the media in recent years’.

Limitation of these rights can be imposed by states in accordance with their national legislation and international human rights obligations, in full respect of the principle of necessity and proportionality. This delicate balance, including between the protection of national security and the right of the public to be informed about potential threats to the public interest is a matter for courts to assess. Any individual, including Julian Assange, must be given the opportunity to challenge the restriction of his rights, including to freedom of expression, by the competent judicial authorities.

Romana Jerković,"Madam President, dear colleagues, in today’s digital era the term ‘digital identity’ frequently arises in relation to many of our daily activities. Whether we talk about online banking, shopping online, accessing government services online, or simply signing up for a new social media account, we all use our digital identity on a daily basis. But our increased presence online raises multiple security challenges: identity theft, cyber-attacks and monetisation of personal data. It is our duty to protect citizens and empower them by giving them full control over the use and sharing of their personal data. Under the new law, the biggest innovation is the European Digital Identity Wallet. This virtual and personal digital wallet, in the form of a mobile application, will allow citizens to identify themselves to safely store, manage and share personal data and documents in digital form across the EU. These include a driving licence, medical prescriptions, passports or university diplomas. While many large tech companies today are offering their own digital wallets, the truth is that too often our personal data is used to track our online activity and is sold to marketing companies that use that data to target us with aggressive advertising. We spend a lot of time debating about privacy and security. We insisted on including in the regulation two important principles. The first is cybersecurity by design, meaning that the wallet should be designed with the goal of preventing a cybersecurity breach, rather than repairing the problem once it occurs. The second is privacy by design, which does not allow the issuer of the wallet to track user behaviour and to observe transactions taking place within the wallet. This concept will enforce data minimisation and help address the issue of excessive mining of personal data by big platforms. The ambition of Parliament, and myself as rapporteur, was to give an alternative to all Europeans and to challenge the status quo. We wanted the digital wallet to be a practical tool that both European citizens and businesses will be able to use on a regular basis to solve their most practical day-to-day situations. And I think we achieved that objective. Citizens will be able to prove their identity in a secure and privacy-friendly way, and share and electronically sign personal documents from their digital wallets with the click of a button on their mobile phone. Europeans will be able to access both public and private online services across the EU. Examples of these could be applying for a loan, submitting tax declarations, enrolling for a university, renting an apartment, online voting in elections or registering a newly born child. It is important to emphasise that the holding of the wallet will be entirely a voluntary choice of the citizens. Moreover, this regulation has enormous potential to improve the quality, access and transparency of public services through digitalisation. This is crucial because not all Europeans have access to modern and efficient public services, such as Estonia or Denmark. We need to change this. Finally, we also need to address the lack of interoperability. Today, only a small fraction of online public services can be accessed cross border. We need to overcome these virtual barriers across Europe by enabling access to interoperable public, private and cross-border digital services. Thanks to the new regulation and harmonised standards, citizens will finally be able to use their nationally issued digital IDs seamlessly in all Member States. And let’s face it, our societal interests, such as the right to privacy, lost out in the favour of big commercial interests. Now it’s time for us to mobilise and to make technology adapt to people, instead of the reverse.",S&D,2024-02-28,24.

Kadri Simson,"Madam President, honourable Members, I am extremely pleased to be here today for this very important occasion to endorse the revised Regulation on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency – the so-called REMIT. This revision is key to guarantee that the EU is protected against market manipulation and market abuse, also when it is stemming from external suppliers. It was presented last year by the Commission as a key element in view of the electricity market design reform. The EU’s integrated and interconnected energy market is our biggest asset and its proper functioning is crucial. That is exactly what REMIT is ensuring. Well-functioning energy markets are key to delivering the EU Green Deal and REPowerEU plan objectives. They build trust among all players and contribute to EU competitiveness. I convey my warmest thanks to the rapporteur, Ms Carvalho, and to the team of shadow rapporteurs for all your efforts and remarkable work in bringing this important file to a successful and ambitious conclusion. The Parliament played a key role in delivering this file and it is a major improvement compared to the current rules. First and foremost, the agreed provisions under REMIT introduced a new enforcement regime with ACER’s enhanced role in cross-border investigations. It would allow it to pursue more effectively important cross-border cases with the most significant impact on the markets. This has been a challenge under the current framework, so it is a major step forward. There are also several other improvements, not less important. The new REMIT will improve market transparency by streamlining, at the EU level, the process for collection and disclosure of inside information. It will enhance supervision of reporting parties and data sharing between relevant authorities. We will increase market transparency through an LNG price assessment and benchmark and there will be more effective enforcement towards third country companies that will have to designate a representative in the EU specifically mandated for REMIT compliance. I am looking forward to the plenary vote for REMIT tomorrow, because swift implementation will be key to ensuring timely enforcement and protection against any market abuse, including in important cross-border cases.",-,2024-02-28,23.

Kadri Simson,"Madam President, honourable Members, I have been carefully listening to the various positions expressed by you on this topic and – if you allow me a short side comment – I am coming from the country where lupus has a special status: it is national animal. But from Commission point of view, we are willing to fully cooperate with the Council for the follow-up of our proposal regarding the protection status of the wolf under the Bern Convention in view of a timely decision. And the adaptation of the protection status for the wolf is meant to reflect the significant recovery since the end of the twentieth century in Europe. Therefore, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, it is justified to allow more flexibility to national authorities to decide on the most appropriate measures to better address the situation in their specific regional contexts. But it is also important to recall that if the wolf were moved to Appendix III of the Bern Convention, it would still remain a protected species. While providing more management flexibility to contracting parties, the obligation to conserve healthy wolf populations and to keep them out of danger would remain. So, if the Commission proposal that was tabled on 20 December 2023 is agreed by a qualified majority of Member States in the Council, the EU will be enabled to table the amendment proposal at the next meeting of the Standing Committee of the Bern Convention, and the next meeting of the Standing Committee of the Bern Convention is scheduled to take place end of 2024.",-,2024-02-28,22.

Anna Deparnay-Grunenberg,"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it’s a scandal to see so many colleagues calling to lower the protection status of wolves. Have you actually read the Commission’s in-depth analysis? Because it lacks any scientific basis to your claim. The study highlights the vital role of wolves to our local ecosystem. They regulate wild populations, promote tree growth in our forests and reduce the spread of diseases. The study highlights that killing wolves is neither a long-term solution for farmers nor for livestock, and it highlights the use of preventive herd protection, with fences and dogs as the most effective method for safeguarding sheep and cattle. This attack on wolves, on the Bern Convention and on the Habitats Directive, is another conservative election campaign at the expense of nature. Together we must find solutions for a coexistence of humans and wolves, rather than repeating the old mistakes of the past. We must defend nature.",Greens/EFA,2024-02-28,22.

Josianne Cutajar,"Tourism and hospitality have always been at the cutting edge of the digital transition. Thus, it is only fitting that such a sector has cutting-edge regulation, establishing harmonised rules for data collection and data sharing for short-term rentals. As the Rapporteur for the Committee on Transport and Tourism’s position, I have emphasised from the get-go the need to ensure a balanced ecosystem between hoteliers, hosts, holidaymakers and local communities alike. Balance means empowering national and local regulatory authority with necessary data to be able to ensure a more affordable housing stock in touristic areas without unjustly punishing the booming short-term rental sector that represents nearly a quarter of tourist accommodations. Balance entails data-driven policy and proportionate legislation to ensure quality and sustainable tourism. I am particularly proud to have been able to guarantee that host registration will be possible free of charge or at a reasonable cost, with offline options for the less digitally skilled, especially our senior citizens. This is something that will benefit entrepreneurs but also individuals who are renting out to help make ends meet.

Didier Reynders,"Mr President, honourable Members, it is a pleasure to be with you today for this debate, replacing Executive Vice-President Šefčovič, who unfortunately could not be present. Europe’s history is one of liberal democracies getting stronger and more prosperous together. Since 1957, the European Union and the European Community before it have successfully gone through several rounds of enlargement, developing into today’s Union of 27 Member States. The decision taken by the European Council in December 2023 completes the picture. The Western Balkans, Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia belong to the European family. They are a crucial part of a Europe whole and free. As stated in Parliament’s report, in an increasingly volatile geopolitical context, the political urge of so many countries to join the EU underscores the promise of enlargement and shows that the European Union remains an anchor of peace, prosperity and security. Let us just look back when the EU experienced its last major enlargement exactly 20 years ago. Nobody can contest that in spite of the global economic turbulence that we lived through during these years, enlargement has been and still is a success story which has improved the lives of millions and has reinforced our economic resilience. We have also reasons to believe this will be replicated. A larger Union has greater geopolitical weight and influence on the global stage, including as an economic partner. A larger Union can help reduce critical dependencies and allows it to act more autonomously. A larger Union strengthens the competitiveness and growth potential of the single market, creating new opportunities for European citizens and businesses. A larger Union is an opportunity to enhance energy security and to promote higher environmental, social and consumer standards. Most importantly, as the co-rapporteurs are stating, a larger Union, if well managed, will be the opportunity to expand and anchor democracy, the rule of law and respect of human rights across our continent. However, for these benefits to materialise, full and sustained political commitment is required from all sides. First and foremost, enlargement is and will remain a merit-based process. It requires major efforts by the candidate countries, and for the EU itself, we must show the same determination. Both trucks should advance in parallel. We must start preparing today for the Union of tomorrow. Whilst we widen the union, we must also deepen it. We can and we must do both at the same time. We must use enlargement as a catalyst for progress and reforms. Honourable Members, I note that this is also one of the main messages of the report presented to us today that will feed into the preparations for the communication that the Commission will present soon. To conclude, I would therefore like to warmly thank the two rapporteurs for their invaluable contribution. This is a keystone in our ongoing collective reflections.",-,2024-02-28,20.

Kim Van Sparrentak,"Madam President, I think this debate has made very clear that there is very strong support for this regulation, and that the impact of the growth of short-term rentals is a concern shared by many colleagues here in the House. So let me take the opportunity of this debate to raise one point concerning market access requirements. Whilst market access requirements – and therefore the interpretation of the Services Directive as such – were not subjects of this regulation. Colegislators ensured that the possibility to establish authorisation schemes would not be undermined. The possibility to put in place an authorisation scheme for short-term rental activities was the subject of a landmark ruling of the European Court of Justice in the Cali Apartments case. The European Court ruled that authorisation schemes can be justified by an overriding reason relating to the public interest, consisting of combating the rental housing shortage, and are therefore in line with the Services Directive. So it’s been an unpleasant surprise to hear that the Commission has started questioning – through so-called pilot infringement proceedings – the validity of rules put in place by large cities to simply protect their citizens. This can undermine existing rules and, therefore, the usefulness of data sharing, and also have a chilling effect on other authorities that want to put in place such schemes. Several Member States have written to the Commission already with the request to stop these actions. Starting infringements has, coincidentally, also been the main demand of Airbnb when it came to this legislation. In the context of an escalating housing crisis, the Commission would simply be sending the wrong signal to local authorities that are simply trying to ensure their cities are liveable. So let me once again state: houses are for people, not for profit. That should also be the goal of the European Union and we should make sure that people can still afford to live in our Union.",Greens/EFA,2024-02-28,21.

Ciarán Cuffe,"Madam President, Commissioner, Europe has a housing problem. We have under-occupation in some areas; we have overcrowding in others. We need to take action. There are 18 000 entire houses to rent on Airbnb in my country; thousands on another site. But there’s also 13 000 people living in hotel bedrooms who would love to have more permanent occupation. Without regulation, these platforms are a monster. Properly regulated, they can provide accommodation for all who need it. Short-term lettings are making our housing crisis worse by taking homes off the market and they’re driving up prices and rents. Meanwhile, the Commission is delaying the introduction of a registration system in Ireland. Enough is enough! We have to provide solutions, not barriers to progress. The short-term regulation is progress. Sharing data is the future. We now need measures for more oversight of short-term rentals.",Greens/EFA,2024-02-28,21.

Kim Van Sparrentak,"Madam President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, we all know the wonderful and well-crafted founding myth of Airbnb – the dream of having your own bed and breakfast, even if just an air mattress in your apartment. And, sure, short-term rentals created opportunities, be it for the development of tourism in areas that were previously unfindable in tourist guides or by providing hosting alternatives to travellers. But in the last decade, we have seen a massive growth of the short-term rentals phenomenon, and the occasional renting out of spare rooms has turned into a full-blown business model driven by investors. In Amsterdam, 78% of the 8 739 listings on Airbnb are entire homes or apartments. That means that almost 7 000 homes or apartments are rented out for tourism rather than for residents. Meanwhile, there are not enough teachers in Amsterdam because they simply can’t afford to live there anymore. This development is simply capitalism doing its job. Renting out to tourists is more profitable than long-term rentals. On average, a listing in Amsterdam can generate an income of EUR 22 000 per year so houses are rented out as a holiday place for profit rather than as a home to live in. Research convincingly shows that short-term rentals contribute to driving up housing prices and rents. They also put the liveability of neighbourhoods under pressure. There are, of course, noise disturbances, but locals also see convenience stores and other services for residents disappear. And when you live in a neighbourhood with many Airbnbs, this has a dramatic effect on the social cohesion in your area. So you think, okay, if the situation is that bad, why don’t cities do something about it? And that’s where this legislation comes into play. Many cities and regions are trying to tackle overtourism and have developed local rules on short-term rentals, often introducing a maximum number of nights and guests that accommodation can be rented for and an obligation to register or – in certain cities – to obtain authorisation for renting out a flat to tourists. And in some cases – where the situation is extremely pressing – we have zone bans that have been introduced. But you need one thing to make sure that you can enforce these rules and that’s data – data on which listings are rented out for how many nights and to how many guests. Cities have been requesting to receive this data from the platforms for years, but the short-term rental platforms have been unwilling to share data with cities and have started an endless series of court cases to try to get rid of rules. So cities have put in place special inspection teams that have reverted to online and offline detective work, and are spending up to EUR 2 million a year to get a grip on their housing stock. Again, this is a burden smaller authorities can’t carry. So with this regulation, we are making clear that Big Tech doesn’t make the rules. And we are obliging these platforms to share data with authorities on a regular basis. Short-term rental platforms have to share data on the number of nights and the number of guests in an accommodation that was rented out on a monthly basis to a national platform. If local authorities want access to the data, they have to put in place a registration procedure. The sharing of data will allow cities and other authorities to better enforce the existing rules – including through the removal of illegal listings – and will contribute to fighting the housing crisis by tackling speculation and safeguarding access to affordable housing. I want to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive approach that allowed us to bridge our political differences, resulting in unanimous support in the IMCO Committee for the trilogue outcome. I therefore count on strong support as well in the vote tomorrow. And I want to thank again the Commission because we called for getting this legislation into place.

At its core, it’s about improving people’s lives, about finishing the work that we started over 70 years ago: creating the large zone of democracy and rule of law on our continent. It has been our most successful foreign policy instrument, and it became a geopolitical necessity now to protect ourselves and our neighbours against autocracy and continued instability. But the EU itself needs to improve as well. It is up to us to make sure these two things go hand in hand in the interest of old and new citizens alike. We have an opportunity to turn the upcoming accession of countries into a win-win situation, strengthening and reforming our Union, while at the same time living up to our promises towards candidate countries. We have to ensure that the one process will not be hijacked by the other. We cannot have a situation that candidates have implemented all reforms, but we are not ready. Let’s unleash all creativity to reform and complete our Union as soon as possible. The citizens of Kyiv, Pristina and Tirana are Europeans.

It is our strategic interest in the face of Russian aggression, but it is also the right thing to do. But also, let’s face it: in the recent years, the enforcement of the rule of law reforms have not been adequate in the enlargement countries. Just take the example of Serbia, when it was the Commission that watered down the standards. So, we need transparent and firm criteria on the rule of law front. Also, we have to have our own house in order. Stopping democratic backsliding in the EU is step number one for a credible accession policy, and getting rid of the unanimity voting is step number two. We need to welcome new members into an EU that works properly, that can properly accommodate them. With 27 members already, we often find ourselves in gridlock.

Building bridges and highways is welcomed, but respect for fundamental values must be a precondition for that. The European Union is more than an economic union. It’s the Union of values and the Union of shared risks. Once the candidate country fulfils all the criteria, there should be no political delays to its accession.

I am more concerned with our side, because we still do not know how to stop the Orbánisation of the Union, when one country can blackmail and misuse veto power for selfish purposes. The blackmail through veto power that Hungary was using on Ukrainian issues in the last several years is a clear violation of Article 4 of the Treaty on European Union, which demands from Member States their sincere cooperation and loyalty to the Union.

Jacek Saryusz-Wolski,"Mr President, saying that enlargement necessitates EU centralisation via treaty change is a blatant lie. Such claim is factually wrong and biased, both politically and ideologically. Enlargement is just a false pretext to build, as planned, a European superstate to replace the European Union of today. The ultimate proof of it is that planned reform proposes to preserve, not to eliminate, the veto on decision on enlargement. The vast scientific empirical research which has been analysing the impact of previous enlargements – from the early years until the last one – on the functioning of the EU institutions, proves that the enlargement had no negative effect on the decision-making capacity of the EU. It is also confirmed by the documents of the Council secretariat. On the contrary, empirical data prove that the speed of decision-making has actually increased. Moreover, various serious academic studies demonstrate that, after each enlargement, decision-making was faster when there were more Member States. Additionally, experts say that with a view to enlargement, you should decentralise, not further centralise.

Yes, there’s also geostrategic reasons for us to speed up the candidacy process, but we, in this report, state very clearly that Copenhagen criteria have to be the basis of negotiation and of an accession process. Also, we need to start to reward countries that have a full alignment with our security and foreign policy. We need to reward those that align, but we also need to set consequences for the ones that do not align, because we also have candidate applicants that are actively cooperating with China, that are actively aligning their security and foreign policy with Russia, that are backtracking on democratic standards like election law. There we need to be consequent and also withdraw funds from these countries, because otherwise the process of accession is not a trustworthy one, if you do not reward the ones that deliver. We need to look towards the East, and we need to look towards the new big candidate countries. First of all, the support for Ukraine needs to be uncontested and there is some additional work to do. Because unfortunately we cannot rely on the support that will be coming from the US: who knows how these presidential elections end.

Danuta Maria Hübner,"Mr President, Vice-President, Commissioner, colleagues, it was a pleasure to work on this report at this time. European enlargement policy is a powerful tool to promote democracy, the rule of law, respect of fundamental rights. It also gives the EU a stronger voice on the world stage. For aspiring countries, a credible, merit-based prospect of EU membership is the key driver of transformation. Striving to join the European Community, they see the EU membership as a geostrategic investment in prosperity, stability and security based on common European values. Becoming part of the largest single market in the world opens doors for businesses to expand, innovate, invest and create new jobs. Recent rebooting of the enlargement policy after the aggression of Russia has a geopolitical logic. It will expand the democratic space on our continent and make it clear to Russia what is our preferred political order in Europe. But there are risks. The end of the war is unpredictable. We failed to isolate Russia globally, and we must spare no effort to avoid a decline of support for Ukraine. European enlargement has always been a ‘win-win’ situation for the Union and the newcomers. To ensure it this time, the EU must make its institutional and structural frameworks fit for purpose. The EU has committed to stand with Ukraine every step of the way towards the end of the war and the accession.

Rest assured that the EU will stay vocal on the human rights situation in Russia, including with public communication and in international human rights fora. We will continue to keep the international pressure on Russia. At the same time, we will continue to help and cooperate with Russian organisations and movements who share our values both inside and outside Russia to support a different future for Russia. Alexei Navalny will be remembered as a brave man, a talented organiser and a modern politician who early understood the power of social media. A man who gave hope and believed in the future of a different Russia. He used his influence to bring mass protests to the streets across Russia, exposing the corruption of Putin’s regime.

Yesterday in Bulgaria, two Russian spies were caught doing their duties as belonging to the Russian Federation military forces. Those people, yes, probably did not shoot anyone, but they did not work in favour of European Union, respecting our rules and our way of life. So the soldiers are already here. Yes, maybe a different type of soldiers, but they are here. The death of Alexei Navalny is yet another example that Stalinism is back in Russia and we should be prepared that nothing good we can expect from Russia and we should be prepared, sparing enough funds to prepare our military forces to react if the worst is coming to us.",PPE,2024-02-28,11.

Mathieu Michel,"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, honourable Members, allow me to thank you for your longstanding support to the EU’s common security and defence policy. Today’s debate illustrates the importance of staying united and firm in supporting Ukraine with the tools to defend itself. In the European Council of 14 and 15 December, EU leaders stressed the importance of timely, predictable and sustainable military support for Ukraine, notably through the European Peace Facility and the EU Military Assistance Mission, as well as through direct bilateral assistance by Member States. At the Special European Council of 1 February, EU leaders gave a clear task to the Council to reach agreement on the Ukraine Assistance Fund by early March 2024. Work is currently ongoing in the Council. The European Union has stood by Ukraine and for peace since day one, and we will remain steadfast in our support until Ukraine prevails against Russia’s aggression. It is important to strengthen the defence industrial sector and to work jointly to better create synergies in defence production. In this sense, we are taking concrete steps: the conclusions of the December European Council called for the swift presentation of the European defence industrial strategy. The Commission, together with the High Representative, should present this strategy very shortly. The aim of the strategy is to strengthen the European defence technology industrial base in the broad sense. The issues of access to war materials and critical technologies, harmful dependencies and security of supply are part of this discussion. Its aim, however, is not to build a protectionist industry. Its aim is to build a competitive industrial base that will help support and address Member States’ and allies’ requirements. The strategy will offer a framework and vision for the next years, it will not in itself be a legal or regulatory instrument. Besides, the European Council has also called on the Commission to present a proposal for a European Defence Investment Programme, or EDIP. EDIP was announced in the joint communication on defence investment gaps. EDIP would be an industrial programme building on EDIRPA, ASAP and possible other elements. The EDIP Regulation could serve as the anchor for future joint development and procurement projects of high common interest at EU level. If we wants to be a geopolitical player in an increasingly dangerous world, we need to have the means to defend ourselves, but also the capacity to respond to challenges and emerging conflicts in other parts of the world, be it in Africa, the Middle East or even the Indo-Pacific.",-,2024-02-28,4.

We can’t have internal security with a socially divided EU that doesn’t prioritise the concerns and needs of its own citizens.

And we fear to give Ukraine enough weapons for the victory in the near future, because we are afraid that Putin will escalate.

Did we wake up for a new voice? Are we changing, building a new Europe? Yes. In that distant and also close Ukraine, we show that when we want, we can support our ideals. However, the world still doubts us. They doubt us because of our response or absence of response to the destruction of Palestine, to the Kurds in Syria, to Armenia and Central Africa.

Russia has increased, by the accounts of the Bank of Finland , by 35 % the production of war-related industries from the pre-war period in 2002.

Secondly, decisions on a compulsory contribution from Member States to military support for Ukraine must be taken. A common level of support from national budgets is essential.

The report emphasises full support for Israel and for Israel’s right to defend itself in accordance with international law. I would like the rapporteur of the report to please point out what system of law he is appealing to, because nowhere in international law does it allow for a state to claim the right of self-defence against a threat that emanates from a territory it occupies, from a territory that is kept under belligerent occupation. Israel is a foreign nation illegally occupying Palestine. The Palestinians are the ones with the right to self-defence, not the Israelis.

I was just checking the numbers before this debate. The current situation has been that Mr Macron is very big with the words, very nice words, but the fact is that the French has given to Ukraine only specifically military aid only for about EUR 600 million, from the GDP only 0.067 % has been to aid Ukraine. When our Spanish colleagues were saying also very beautiful words about the common security policy and how to help Ukraine against Russia, Spain has spent only 0.072 % of their GDP to help Ukraine, and all expenses for defence in Spain are only 1.3 % of the GDP, so it’s pretty far away from the target 2 %.

Common foreign security and defence policies cannot remain the weakest links of our integrations. Institutional reforms that will increase our cohesion and coherence are absolutely needed. Still, they must be based on a clear assessment of Europe’s needs rather than being used as a political power tool.

While NATO remains the guarantee of its security, Europe has to demonstrate it can defend its own people, culture and values on its own, if necessary.

I would suggest that in its next term the Commission sets common European defence as a top priority and creates two major portfolios headed by a commissioner each. I am very glad that Ursula von der Leyen mentioned the first one in her statement: one responsible for the establishment of a common army, air force and navy, and another, which is equally important, for harmonising intelligence the activity of the national secret services.

Sven Mikser,"Mr President, President of the Commission, colleagues, Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has made many of us reassess our previously held convictions and beliefs about European security needs. What is more, it has exposed vulnerabilities caused by decades of underinvestment in defence and security, both in individual Member States as well as at the European Union level. Let me say that, perhaps unlike in Finland or Estonia, the conservatives in some larger countries were also complicit in this strategic naivety. Russia’s brutal aggression against Ukraine must not succeed. It is our moral duty to support the fight for the survival of a sovereign, democratic European nation. But we have to understand that Ukraine’s defeat would also be devastating for EU security and present a mortal threat to the rules-based international order as we know it. Since Putin escalated his war over two years ago, the EU has taken many unprecedented steps. The use of the European Peace Facility to reimburse Member States for equipment donated to Ukraine and the initiative to ramp up production of ammunition and missiles are steps in the right direction. But I am sure that the history books will not judge us based on what we did or spent or what we said in this noble Chamber, but on whether we actually managed to help Ukraine win the war. So we need to do more and do it now. It’s a matter of utmost urgency because while we are talking, Russia is making gains on the ground that will be very difficult and costly to reverse later. We know that Putin’s Russia presents not only a threat limited to the indirect implications of the Ukraine war. There is and will be for the foreseeable future a direct military threat from Russia to EU Member States, territories and people. In order to provide credible deterrence against the threat or, if necessary, defend our continent, we will need to spend more on defence. It’s true that more Member States are spending 2 % of their GDP on defence than did so ten years ago, but we know that several larger Member States still fall short of that important threshold. Also, while we have launched on the EU level important initiatives such as EDF, EDIRPA and ASAP to boost joint research and innovation, promote joint procurement and address critical capability shortfalls, it is imperative that we also put additional money on the table. It is impossible to use the same money twice and cannibalising the budgets of existing programmes to finance newer ones is not going to be sustainable. On the defence-industrial level, I think it’s important that we understand that this new security reality will be with us for the foreseeable future, so our industries must have confidence that the orders from governments will not stop the moment the arms fall silent in Ukraine. Europe’s strategic autonomy, obviously, will not be unlimited. It must always be our first choice to act together with our friends and allies. It would be a great mistake to brush our allies aside just for the sake of going alone. Let me recall the words of NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg, who recently described the calls for creating a European nuclear deterrent without the US as unhelpful. But at the same time, we cannot fully ignore the uncomfortable truth that Donald Trump may return to the White House next year. Moreover, there is also far less of a consensus on Capitol Hill when it comes to America’s global security responsibilities than just a few years ago. We cannot completely rule out America’s turn to towards greater isolationism, and this possibility underscores the need to build a militarily stronger and more capable Europe. Finally, while we need to be ready to go alone if necessary and build alliances whenever possible, it is clear that beyond collaborating with our most immediate allies and fellow democracies, we are only going to prevail if we manage to form larger coalitions and convince the rest of the world that our cause is just. Immediately after the beginning of Putin’s full-scale war, we managed to pull together a coalition of more than 140 countries in the UN General Assembly. Today, after months of ongoing humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, recreating such a coalition would be very difficult. I am convinced that every one of us condemns the horrific terror attacks of Hamas and demands the immediate release of all the hostages. The vast majority of us are committed to a two-state solution that provides security for Israel and delivers on the legitimate aspirations of Palestinian people. If it is so, we need to do more, we need to do something very tangible in order to end this unnecessary suffering of millions of displaced and starving people. Only by doing this – which is also a moral obligation – we can convince the rest of the world that we are really committed to maintaining and strengthening the rules-based international order.",S&D,2024-02-28,4.

David McAllister,"Mr President, Madam President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, since we adopted our previous report on the implementation of the common foreign and security policy on 18 January last year, the world has changed significantly. While Mr Putin is relentless in his war of aggression against Ukraine, the horror terrorist attacks launched by Hamas against Israel on 7 October have set the Middle East on fire. In our external action, we need to adapt to these new circumstances. For too long, the European Union has been too cautious; we have not proactively defined and defended our interests in the world. This needs to change. I would like to fully underline what our Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, has said this morning in this plenary and it was actually our Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, who recognised this already back in 2019 when she spoke of a geopolitical Commission and a European Union that needs to understand the language of power. Listening carefully to all the contributions this morning, one thing is obvious: one logical conclusion can only be a strong defence portfolio. But what actually does that mean concretely? Yes, I would like to see a Commissioner for Security and Defence in the next European Commission. She, or perhaps he, should coordinate all EU and Member States defence initiatives and ensure that we are stronger by acting together. Yes, I would want to see EU Member States procure their defence products jointly to improve the interoperability of our armed forces and to reduce the costs for taxpayers. The EU defence industry reinforcement act, EDIRPA, was an important starting point, but it is far from enough. Yes, we must help the European defence industry to increase its production capacity to ensure that our armed forces are fully equipped. We must provide Ukraine with whatever it takes to win this war as long as it takes. Also, in that regard, we made a first step with the act in support of ammunition production. But we urgently, colleagues, need to go further with a future European defence investment programme and by establishing a well-funded Ukraine assistance fund under the European Peace Facility. Ultimately, it is about further establishing a single market for defence. The long-term goal, dear colleagues, is, of course, to develop a true European Defence Union, a fully-fledged European Defence Union. All our activities need to be closely coordinated with NATO, with our transatlantic partners, the Americans, the Canadians, the British. Let us remain transatlantic and at the same time become more European. That is the way forward. And I would once again like to address our Commission President, because since 2019, dear Ursula von der Leyen, you have taken the right approach. You are strengthening Europe’s global footprint and supporting the principles that inspired our own creation, development and enlargement. Since we have discussed my own report extensively in AFET, I will not refer to my own report. I would just like to thank all colleagues involved, especially the shadow rapporteurs, the involved staff members and also the team of the High Representative / Vice-President for the constructive and fruitful cooperation. Since this will be the final report on the implementation of our common foreign and security policy in this legislature, hopefully the next Commission and the next High Representative are invited to use this year’s CFSP report as a guide for their priorities.",PPE,2024-02-28,4.

Pedro Marques,"Madam President, colleagues, an important debate, this one, at an existential moment for Europe and the world. One has to start by saying we did well on responding to yet another existential threat to the world – that was COVID. We were safe and the Europeans recognise it, but the rest of the world accused us of just taking care of the rich people in the West. We did also well when Putin invaded Ukraine with an extraordinary effort by our High Representative, we were united from the beginning, sanctioning Putin and delivering weapons to Ukraine. Now, yet another war came to our borders, increasing the uncertainty of the times that we live. We can’t simply look the other way when 30 000 people died in a few months at the hands of the Israeli army in Gaza. The rest of the world is yet again questioning our moral compass. But it is us that should be questioning, ‘What are we doing in these dramatic times?’ President von der Leyen, if we want to be safer in the world, we have to be a more geopolitical Europe, as you correctly pointed out at times. But the world will not forgive us for our double standards. The world will not partner with us if they feel left behind, just as long as they are not Caucasian or rich. If we want to be more geopolitical, we need to keep our moral compass and then we have to go geostrategic and start really mobilising all our instruments. Where are our concrete actions for lasting partnerships with Africa and Latin America? Will we just give up to President Macron’s domestic problems and turn our back on the rest of the world? We can’t continue to hesitate. We need to go forward, not stall our ambition. If we want to be safe, we need to be stronger to make ourselves respected in the world. Where are the funds, the actual funds that we need for the strategic autonomy of Europe? A greener Europe will also be a safer Europe for the future. Have you told Mr Weber, President von der Leyen, have you told him this much? Do you know that the EPP is trying to tear down the green policies that we built, also with the work of the Commission, trading the future of Europe and the planet for just a few thousand votes? A Europe with more opportunities for all is also a safer Europe for all. Where are your concrete policies for a more social Europe? Have you forgotten the politics for the people, particularly those that suffered the most here in Europe? The EU also misses proposals to really face the threats of China, or even the aggressive IRA of the US. Not with words and strategies, but with resources for our economy to match the ambition of these programmes of particularly the Chinese rivals. A global vision, we do need; a strategy, we do need – but we also need concrete tools to act. Where are our teeth when some of our natural allies, let alone our opponents, challenge our common values or interests? What did you do in concrete terms to stop Netanyahu’s unacceptable actions in Gaza that followed the madness of Hamas? What did you do to actually promote lasting peace? Why didn’t you personally call for an unconditional ceasefire now that millions have their lives threatened in Rafah, Madam President? Guterres and Borrell, they led by example in this conflict, but from you, I am sorry to say, President von der Leyen, it’s been silence in action after a serious initial mistake. A safer Europe will be a Europe that projects its strengths in the world to promote peace, not war, to promote development, not inequalities. A safer Europe will be able to be more relevant in its own defence, saying yes to NATO, saying yes to its neighbours. But it has to be a Europe based on solidarity and knowing that, as always, an eye for an eye will only turn this world into blindness.",S&D,2024-02-28,4.

Manfred Weber,"Madam President, President von der Leyen, Council, dear colleagues, as EPP, we are, first of all, happy to have the debate today. Such an upgraded top-level debate about the Defence Union. EPP was asking for this for a long period of time and that’s why it is good to have it. For us, first of all, I want to underline that the subject itself is not innovative at all. I said it already in my last speech: in 1945, Adenauer, Schuman, De Gasperi started with the Defence Union. The French Parliament rejected, De Gasperi had tears in his eyes after it failed in the French Parliament. The idea, in 1954, was, after the Second World War, unifying armies, never again war in Europe. What a fascinating idea behind it – and we are back to this debate. We are back to this debate – again we discuss this subject with the idea never again war in Europe. But that means today to be strong, and that’s why we are so happy to have this debate. The first point, from an EPP perspective, is: the debate about NATO-EU is, for us, not a debate at all. The NATO is fundamental for us. We also welcome Finland and Sweden joining the NATO. The EPP parties in Finland always were in favour – even when it was unpopular in the country – in favour of joining. Socialists finally also are supporting now joining the NATO from the both countries, so welcome in the club. But there is a good outcome. We have them now among us and, in the long run, we must understand that 330 million Americans will not defend, in the long run, 440 million Europeans. We have to do it by our own means. That’s why it’s not in contradiction, it’s the same as what we are doing here to strengthen NATO with a strong EU pillar. The concrete actions is now to implement the European single market, and there we welcome very much the presentation of Ursula von der Leyen, the ambitions of Ursula von der Leyen. The Americans have one tank, we have 17 different kinds of tanks. The Americans have 30 weapon systems, we have 160 weapon systems. It’s so obvious that we are wasting money. We have to buy European. We have to care about our jobs. We have to do common export rules for the future, to have common industry in defence. We need to coordinate all this. That’s why the idea to have a Commissioner responsible for doing so is exactly what we need – and on short term, we have to finance it. So, the EIB development is a good one, but I want to add also that, on the taxonomy rules, we have to rethink them, because, currently, taxonomy rules are also an obstacle for financing defence goods. That’s why we have to make it possible that the private sector is financing this. Listening to the Council speaker, I have to say that we heard so much already about these kind of speeches, that it is national responsibility. My clear demand is: stop speaking, please act now, on the Council side. We need also joint actions about the areas where we have an obvious European added value, and it is about cyber defence, about a missile defence shield, about the joint mission, for example, in the future of sub-Sahara to not hand over the region to Wagner troops or to the Islamist terrorists. That is another point for us that we have to care about the current state of play, on defending Ukraine. Erlauben Sie mir, auf Deutsch weiterzumachen. Wir spüren, dass die Geschlossenheit in der Europäischen Union leider Gottes bröckelt. Ich bin enttäuscht über das, was manche Führer auf nationaler Ebene die letzten Tage von sich gegeben haben. Emmanuel Macron hat eine sinnlose Debatte angestoßen über die Fragestellung, ob französische Truppen in der Ukraine eingesetzt werden. Diese Debatte war sinnlos und sie hat Europa und die westliche Hemisphäre gespalten. Und das Zweite: Der deutsche Bundeskanzler Olaf Scholz hat in Deutschland die Weisung ausgegeben, mit der Lieferung von-Taurus Raketen würde Deutschland Kriegspartei werden, was rechtlich falsch ist und was er ja leider Gottes bei den Leopard-Panzern auch schon formuliert hat, was nur die russische Propaganda bestätigt, nämlich, dass damit einige Teile Deutschlands, Europas Teil des Kriegs werden könnten. Beide Führer haben zur Spaltung Europas beigetragen und nicht zur Einheit Europas. Ich kann nur sagen: Hört damit auf! Putin hasst die Art, wie wir leben. Die Ukraine darf nicht fallen. Wir müssen Russland stoppen. Appeasement funktioniert nicht, wie wir es bei Nord Stream 2 erlebt haben. Und deswegen: Danke an Ursula von der Leyen, Roberta Metsola, Donald Tusk, der sehr stark war. Ich möchte auch Giorgia Meloni erwähnen, die im G7-Gipfel eine starke Rolle gespielt hat. Wir brauchen jetzt Menschen, die zusammenführen, die Einigung zeigen, und nicht Menschen, die spalten. Und deshalb: Putin versteht nur die Methode der Stärke. Und ich möchte am Schluss George Washington zitieren: ‘The best way to prevent war is to prepare for it.’",PPE,2024-02-28,4.

Ursula von der Leyen,"Madam President, Mr State Secretary, honourable Members, in the last years, many European illusions have been shattered. The illusion that peace is permanent. The illusion that economic prosperity might matter more to Putin than destroying a free and democratic Ukraine. The illusion that Europe on its own was doing enough on security – be it economic or military, conventional or cyber. As we look around us, it is clear there is no room for any more illusions. Putin used the peace dividend to prepare for this war. As a result, the world is as dangerous as it has been for generations. Russia’s brutal war of aggression against Ukraine is now in its third year and is more entrenched and intense than ever. We are seeing the potency and the dangers of a rising and disturbing league of authoritarians. North Korea is delivering order after order of ammunition shells to Russia. And Iran is providing attack drones and, crucially, also the technology behind them to inflict untold damage on Ukrainian cities and citizens. The continuing war in Gaza and the large-scale destabilisation in the Middle East point to an era of insecurity and conflict in the region and beyond. And we are also seeing the continued rise of aggressive economic competition and distortion, which brings with it some very real European security risks. So, to put it as bluntly as outgoing President Niinistö of Finland did last month: ‘Europe has to wake up.’ And I would add: urgently. We all know there is so much at stake here – our freedom and our prosperity. And we have to start acting like it. We need to start working on the future of the European security architecture in all of its dimensions, and with all of the speed and political will that is required. Because the truth is, we have not been living with conflict merely since 2022, but for far longer. The threats to our security and prosperity and our way of life come in many different forms, and we all know them. Some of them are obvious, some of them are hazier on the surface. Be it tackling political interference, reducing our dangerous dependency – a policy that I have called de-risking – or be it eliminating hostile actors from our critical infrastructure, we Europeans must be on guard. This is not just about defeating bullies on the battlefield, but across all our societies. The good news is we have started a lot of that work already. In fact, the last years have not only served to shatter some European illusions, but they have also shattered many illusions about Europe. That our unity would not hold in the face of a war on our continent, or that our rules and divisions would hold us back in providing massive financial, military and political support. Well, over the last two years, Europe has shown and proven that it will support Ukraine for as long as it takes. And we have also shown and proven that a more sovereign Europe is not just wishful thinking. At this point, let me be very clear. European sovereignty will make our partnerships stronger. It will never affect the importance and the need for our NATO alliance. In fact, a more sovereign Europe, in particular on defence, is vital to strengthening NATO. That is why I am pleased with the news that Sweden will soon become a NATO ally. And I want to congratulate Sweden, under the leadership of Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, on the historic step for this country. At its core, European sovereignty is about taking responsibility ourselves for what is vital and even existential for us. It is about our ability, but also about our willingness to defend our interests and values ourselves. This is what leaders agreed with the Versailles agenda just after the start of the war to reduce our strategic dependencies in critical areas like energy, like key technologies – you remember the semiconductors – economic capacities and, of course, defence. Member States have stepped up. Just last week, the naval mission Aspides was launched to protect against the direct threat to the freedom of navigation – freedom of navigation that serves as a bedrock of global trade in one of the world’s most critical waterways. And Member States have stepped up their defence spending too. Their national defence budgets have already risen by 20% from last year. And NATO has just announced that it expects 18 of its members to beat the 2% defence spending target this year. That is up from only three members a decade ago. And, together, we are now spending more jointly on common capacities and projects between Europeans. The European Peace Facility has mobilised EUR 6.1 billion to support the Ukrainian armed forces with lethal and non-lethal military equipment and supplies. The European Defence Fund is investing in high-end defence capabilities in critical areas such as naval, ground or air combat, space-based early warning systems or cyber. And we have taken big steps forward in growing our defence, industrial and manufacturing capacities. In the next weeks, we will announce award decisions under the ASAP programme, and this funding will enable us to roughly double European ammunition production to over two million shells a year by the end of 2025. Honourable Members, all of this progress shows that Europe has started to grasp the urgency and the scale of the challenge that is ahead of us. But there is a lot more to do and we need to move fast. The threat of war may not be imminent, but it is not impossible. The risks of war should not be overblown, but they should be prepared for. And that starts with the urgent need to rebuild, replenish and modernise Member States’ armed forces. In doing so, Europe should strive to develop and manufacture the next generation of battle-winning operational capabilities and to ensure it has sufficient quantity of material and the technological superiority that we may need in the future. That means turbocharging our defence industrial capacity in the next five years. At the heart of this must be a simple principle: Europe must spend more, spend better, spend European. We will put forward some proposals in the next weeks with the first ever European Industrial Defence Strategy. One of the central aims of the strategy, and the European Defence Investment Programme that will come with it, will be to prioritise defence joint procurement. Just as we did it very successfully with the vaccines or, for example, with natural gas. This will help us reduce fragmentation and increase interoperability. But to do this we must collectively send a strong signal to industry. This is why we will look at how to facilitate, for example, offtake agreements. They need security and the knowledge that the products will be taken off. Or, for example, advanced purchase agreements where we provide guarantees. This would give our defence industry companies very stable orders and, most importantly, predictability in the long run. We will increase support for industrial ramp-up, as we are now doing with ammunition with ASAP. We will identify European defence projects of common interest to focus efforts and resources where it has the biggest impact and added value. And we will focus on innovation to ensure Europe has that edge in the new technologies, which we see being deployed across the world in different continents. This must be a truly European effort. And that is why I am proud to announce that we will set up an Office for Defence Innovation in Kyiv. This will bring Ukraine ever closer to Europe and it will enable all Member States to draw on Ukraine’s battlefield experience and expertise in industrial defence innovation. Honourable Members, making this step together on defence will not be easy. It will require bold decisions and political courage. And it will require, above all, a new European defence mindset from institutions to industries to investors. That is why I’m very encouraged by the words of President Calviño that the EIB is ready to do more, to contribute, to join projects that boost the European defence industry. And I really call now on Member States to endorse this proposal. Defence industry in Europe needs access to capital. I would like to encourage our public and private lenders to support our defence industry and in particular, small and medium enterprises. Also in defence, small and medium enterprises are the backbone of our industry. They are the driver of innovation and a critical factor in the single market. And the topic needs undivided attention. This is why I’m personally supportive of a designated Defence Commissioner for the next Commission. And beyond that, I would like us to think bigger. It is time to start a conversation about using the windfall profits of frozen Russian assets to jointly purchase military equipment for Ukraine. There could be no stronger symbol and no greater use for that money than to make Ukraine and all of Europe a safer place to live. Honourable Members, ultimately, this is about Europe taking responsibility for its own security. The simple truth is: we do not have the luxury of comfort. We do not have the control of elections or decisions in other parts of the world. We simply do not have the time to skirt around the issue. With or without the support of our partners, we cannot let Russia win. And the cost of insecurity – the cost of a Russian victory – is far greater than any saving we could make now. This is why it is time for Europe to step up. Long live Europe.",-,2024-02-28,4.

Mathieu Michel,"Madam President, Madam President of the European Commission, honourable Members of the European Parliament, 2023 was a very challenging year. The international system continues to face multiple and overlapping challenges. We face two wars on our doorstep while climate, food and energy crises pose threats to global peace and security, hamper global governance and slow down sustainable development. This forces us to fundamentally rethink our Union. Right now, two issues are urgent priorities: Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and the war that has flared up once again in the Middle East. In the current geopolitical contexts, security and defence must be the top priority of Europeans. Two years ago, the Strategic Compass was proposed and launched. At that time, nobody paid a lot of attention. Now the need to strengthen our defence at EU level has become obvious to everybody. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine marks a watershed moment in European defence. Within weeks, dogmas that had stood for decades were overturned. First, the European Peace Facility was used to incentivise Member States to give more military equipment to Ukraine. Never before had the EU financed the delivery of military equipment to a country at war. So far, the EU and Member States have mobilised more than EUR 28 billion of military assistance. Later, the largest military mission in the EU’s history was launched to train the Ukrainian army. By the end of this summer, 60 000 Ukrainian soldiers will have been trained on EU soil. The training they receive is what Russia’s new recruits often lack. It significantly increases their chances of survival. But the Russian war of aggression has also highlighted the significant weaknesses resulting from 30 years of neglect in defence capacities. The weaknesses exist in terms of material, but also in terms of interoperability. Today, defence budgets are 40% higher than a decade ago, but we still have a long way to go and we all need to accelerate. We are not going to be able to play a geopolitical role if we are not able to defend ourselves. Defence is a national competence. It is the Member States that have armies. We must be able to mobilise our armies to face common threats. We have to make them work together better in order to have more interoperability, more mobility, capacity together and more coordination. We need to spend better. But spending more does not automatically mean spending better. To get the best results, we need economies of scales. To ramp up production, the European defence industry needs certainty of long-term demand. This idea is at the heart of our ammunition initiative. We need to aggregate Member States’ demand, procure jointly and support European industry in ramping up their production capacity. Through the European Defence Agency, we have put in place 60 framework contracts to place orders to the European defence industry. We must follow this example in other areas. Together with European Defence Agency, EU Ministers of Defence have already identified the key capabilities they need, ranging from ground combat capabilities and integrated air missiles defence to underwater warfare capabilities, space services, cyber defence or other strategic enablers. All this, a stronger EU defence with Member States spending more and better together, will also help strengthen NATO. Through the Strategic Compass, we are also working to make our armies more interoperable and our EU operational engagement more effective. Evacuations, such as in Afghanistan and Sudan, have shown that EU Member States often depend on outside help to protect and evacuate their citizens. We need the capacity to act with partners where possible, but also alone if needed. By 2025, we will have a Rapid Deployment Capacity allowing us to quickly deploy up to 5 000 troops in response to crisis situations. As part of this work, we conducted last October, the first live EU military exercise in Cádiz in Spain. Interoperability is also key for our CSDP mission. In this more and more volatile world, they are increasingly important to protect European security interests abroad and contribute to global and regional stability. We are already working closely together in the context of our common security and defence policy missions. Since the beginning of this legislative mandate, the EU has launched seven civilian and military missions, including last week, our new maritime security operation ASPIDES in the Red Sea. Through ASPIDES, ATALANTA and our coordinated maritime presence in the Gulf of Guinea, we are showing that the EU can act decisively when our maritime security is at risk. Other examples of our concrete operational engagement – and not only military – are the civilian missions launched last year in Armenia to contribute to stability along the border with Azerbaijan or in Moldova to strengthen their resilience against hybrid threats. Russia’s war against Ukraine has reminded us how critical traditional military capabilities, like tanks, artillery or ammunition remain, but also how much hybrid threats and space, cyber and critical infrastructure as well as information manipulation have changed the threat landscape. In the past two years, we have seen progress in building capacities in all of those areas. But we can do more. If we want to be a geopolitical player, we need to have the means. And the means start by having a strong defence capacity and a strong defence industry.",-,2024-02-28,4.

Maroš Šefčovič,"Madam President, State Secretary, honourable Members of the European Parliament, first, I would like to thank you for this very important debate, which all political leaders of the groups and most of the honourable Members clearly called a milestone. You would recall that a few years ago, talking about European sovereignty, strategic autonomy or European defence was very difficult in Brussels, but also in this House. But it’s quite clear that two wars close to our borders, energy prices crisis and rough geopolitics, which are shaking the international post-Second World War order and security architecture, galvanised the European response. I would like to reassure all of you that we in the European Commission hear you loud and clear and we respect your calls for urgent action. Ms Hayer was referring to the European miracle of peace, and it’s clear to all of us that this miracle must be defended now. Ms Reintke was rightly underlining then that United Europe is more secure Europe. Therefore, I appreciate the overwhelming support for strategic autonomy and common procurement. We know that common procurement or common purchase works. As the common purchase of vaccines, we have incredible results for common purchase of gas, including the latest round concluded yesterday. It clearly demonstrates that if the European Union acts together and uses its political weight and economic strength, we always get excellent results because the world listens and business acts. And I am sure that we will succeed with this approach also in the area of defence. I would like to thank both rapporteurs, Mr McAllister and Mr Mikser, for the important reports on CFSP and CSDP. And I would like also reassure all of you that all your interventions regarding unwavering support for Ukraine, the importance of complementarity of our actions with NATO, creating conducive environment for financing an investment for defence sector, calls for better interoperability, increase of production capacity and more coordination will be properly reflected in our proposals on the EU Defence Industrial Strategy and investment programmes which we will table next week. As you probably heard me saying in different settings, I am convinced that European unity is our most precious currency. So let’s use it wisely and again, to build Europe, which should be even stronger, more secure and ready for this new insecure world.",-,2024-02-28,4.

Naturally, we demand immediate, unconditional release of all political prisoners in the Russian Federation, but also of all those who were prisoners and of civilians deported forcefully from Ukraine to Russia. This war should be stopped, but we believe that stopping Putin is by showing force. Therefore, we have to remember about necessity to help Ukraine defeat Russia.

President,"Dear members, dear colleagues, we gather here today to pay tribute to Alexei Navalny, in the presence of his brave wife Yulia Navalnaya. (Applause) Dear Yulia, thank you for your readiness to speak in this Chamber to the world in such painful circumstances. It is truly an honour to welcome you to the European Parliament. Before we begin, I would like to invite everyone to turn their attention to the screens to watch a short video about the life and legacy of Alexei Navalny. (A video was shown in the Chamber) Dear Yulia, dear colleagues, on 16 February we received the tragic news of Sakharov Prize laureate Alexei Navalny’s death. For many in Russia and outside, he represented hope: hope in better days; hope in a free Russia; hope in the future; hope that courage can overcome. And while his killers sought to cruelly extinguish that hope, they failed. The hope he represented remains as bright as ever. This House and its Members condemn his killing in the strongest possible terms. It is a crime that deserves an international and independent investigation. The world is owed justice. While we pay tribute to his memory, I want to express our deepest condolences to you dear Yulia, to your children Daria and Zakhar, to Alexei’s parents Lyudmila and Anatoly, to his family, friends and countless supporters in Russia and across the globe. Alexei Navalny dedicated his life to the fight against corruption and for a democratic Russia. He did not give up when they tried to poison him. He did not give up when he was unjustly imprisoned. He did not give up when his sentence was extended in a sham trial. He did not give up even when confronted with suffering and injustice. And neither must we. Democracy takes bravery, and Alexei understood that. That is why he went back to Russia in 2021. That is why he could not be broken. And that is exactly what made the regime so afraid of him. But Alexei’s fight endures. The many brave people that took to the streets of Russia after his death show – yet again – the fragility of authoritarianism. I take solace in the fact that if history teaches us anything, it is that the pillars of autocracy, in the end, always – always – crumble under the weight of its own corruption and people’s inherent desire to live freely. And when they inevitably do, it will be thanks to what Alexei and your family did. So dear Yulia, on behalf of the European Parliament that stands in admiration of your courage, I thank you. The floor is yours. (Loud and sustained applause)",-,2024-02-28,6.

The fight against information, against lies, the fight against criminality, the fight against assassins. We must tackle those who continue to facilitate and hide Russian money. We must continue to defend democracies – our democracies. And in continuing this fight for a free Russia, we support our neighbours in Ukraine.

Well, now, one of the possible faces of this other Russia is passed away. But it’s a tragedy that Alexei Navalny died, but he died for a reason he conveyed to us before his death. He said, ‘If I will die, if they will murder me, that means they are weak and we have to continue the fight.’ And Yulia Navalnaya has visited us in the European Parliament today, which is in itself already meaningful this visit, and she continues to fight.

Get tough on his friends in Europe – Orbán, Dodik, Vučić – and, yes, also rapidly increase military support to Ukraine.

Navalny’s death is a hero’s death and an enormous loss for all those yearning for a free and democratic Russia. It also shows, however, the enormous challenge Putin’s opposition faces. Everyone knows why Putin’s critics fall out of windows. Everyone knows who orders the assassinations, poisonings and abductions of Russian dissidents on the territory of the EU. But nobody understands why the EU does nothing to defend itself. Nobody knows why Putin’s puppets within the EU have not been sanctioned so far. We don’t know why the EU doesn’t stop Russian secret service activity on its own territory, and we haven’t heard of measures the EU will take against Putin’s accomplices who shake his hand, model his regime, echo his narrative and say cynically to those remembering Alexei Navalny that he ‘doesn’t deserve respect’.

Clare Daly,"Mr President, the rights of all people must be respected. As I’ve said many times before, Alexei Navalny should not have been in prison. His death in detention is appalling and an impartial investigation into the circumstances absolutely necessary. But while respecting the dead, we also have to be accurate in our memories. Was he Russia’s democratic messiah? I don’t believe so. A courageous activist? Yes. But what kind? A free marketeer, a fan of the 90s reforms that led to Putin, a race-baiter ejected from the liberals who then founded a nationalist coalition with the extreme right and led anti-immigration rallies in the 2000s. A gun-rights activist who made ads joking about shooting Muslims. Of course, none of this justifies his treatments. His rights are just as important as anybody else. But if Navalny had been a socialist or a trade unionist, I don’t think anybody here would know his name. Two hundred Palestinian journalists have been murdered since October. They don’t matter, because our ally killed them. It’s very clear we care nothing about oppressed civil society unless it’s in our geopolitical interest.",The Left,2024-02-28,11.

Yesterday, our 2009 Sakharov laureate, Oleg Orlov, from Memorial, was convicted on repeated discreditation of the Russian army. He defended himself alone because he did not want to risk that his lawyers would face persecution and prison. And Oleg said in his final statement in court, ‘I regret nothing’. We must show our utmost respect for him and other people persecuted, but we must also find ways, as the European Union, to defend lawyers and their important work. Many of them are now in exile.

We have written a text, a letter, with 87 Members of Parliament to ask for three things, and nothing has been done in the meanwhile. First of all, Magnitsky sanctions against all those involved in the murder of Navalny: judges, prison guards and so on. Nothing has been decided or proposed by the Commission today or in recent days. Secondly, we ask that the Navalny list of 6 000 people will be used in a new sanction package, a 14th sanction package, a list of 6 000 people. Nothing has been proposed in the meanwhile, already 14 days. And thirdly, that the Russian assets finally will be seized, finally will be seized.

Therefore, I welcome today’s address of Ms Yulia Navalnaya, a very courageous woman, in our House. I think it’s also clear that democratic Russia is unfortunately very far from reality. This House has always supported Russian democratic activists, independent civil society and all courageous citizens opposing the brutal dictatorship of Putin. Unfortunately, for now, it seems that the struggle will take more time than expected. Anyway, we need to keep the Kremlin under pressure and hold dictatorship accountable.

Sergey Lagodinsky,"Mr President, 14 years ago, Alexei and myself were riding a bus bringing us back to the Yale University to New Haven. We were discussing prospects for Russian politics. I was sceptical, but Alexei was the one who changed my mind with one simple phrase: we shall convince them if we are able to reach them. This was the essence of his understanding of what it means to be a leader for common good. It was not about exerting benefits, not about serving lobbies. It was about reaching out to his fellow citizens, telling them the truth, believing in them and giving them hope. I don’t have any sentimental relationship to my country of origin, but Alexei and people like him have become my sentiment. People who differ in politics but are united on democracy. People like him and his wife Yulia, who returned to their homeland because they belong to their homeland, to their people, even risking their lives, even losing their lives. People like Vladimir Kara-Murza, who continues speaking the truth despite being poisoned and imprisoned. People like Navalny’s lawyers who continue serving the rights, civil rights and freedom, even though losing them themselves. This resolution is a testimony, a message to those courageous people who believe and don’t give up in despair, even in the face of death. For many of them and for me, Alexei never died. Alexei cannot be killed because you cannot kill hope.

It is so incredibly sad because the reason for you being here is so tragic and wrong. Nobody should have to die for speaking up for what they believe in. All of us here today mourn with you the loss of your husband, Alexei Navalny – a man who became one of the symbols of resistance to Putin’s regime, who stood up for what he believed in and spoke out loud also in the face of repression. Alexei Navalny helped expose Putin to the world. He shone a light on the enormous corruption of Putin and his oligarch friends. It was something that clearly frightened Putin. Because despots like Putin are afraid of facts, of debate, of truth. And your husband tried to bring forward all of that. And for that, he was poisoned and he was accused by the Putin regime. He was unjustly jailed, tortured and he paid the ultimate price. And yet, despite the sadness and the loss that led here, it is also good to hear you and to see you speaking out here today in Strasbourg, because it means that Putin did not succeed in silencing the critique. It means that the fight against repression continues. Dear Yulia Navalnaya, to offer you my condolences seems way too little.

Yulia Navalnaya,"Dear Madam President, dear ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this opportunity to be here today. After Putin tried to kill Alexei for the first time, we lived in southern Germany for several months. Alexei was recovering from the poisoning – learning how to walk and write all over again. We walked a lot, sometimes going on short trips. On one of them, we went to Strasbourg with our children. It is one of my and Alexei’s favourite cities. We have been there several times together, and then, three years ago, we decided to show it to them. Now my husband is dead. I am back in Strasbourg, but I am no longer walking around with my family. I stand here and address you, and in your person, the whole of Europe. I thought that in the 12 days since Alexei’s murder, I would have time to prepare for this speech. But first, we spent a week getting Alexei’s body and organising a funeral. Then I chose the cemetery and the coffin. The funeral will take place the day after tomorrow and I am not sure yet whether it will be peaceful or whether the police will arrest those who have come to say goodbye to my husband. (Applause) However, I’m standing here now because your voters have an important question. They’re asking you about it and then you’re asking me. The question is: ‘How can I help you in your fight?’ Last Saturday was two years since Putin started a full-scale war against Ukraine. A brutal and sneaky war. The whole world rushed to Ukraine’s aid. But two years have passed, there is much exhaustion, much blood, much disappointment, and Putin has gone nowhere. Everything has already been used: weapons, money, sanctions... Nothing is working. And the worst has happened: everyone got used to the war. Here and there people start to say: ‘Well, we will have to come to an agreement with Putin anyway...’ And then Putin killed my husband, Alexei Navalny. On his orders, Alexei was tortured for three years: he was starved in a tiny stone cell, cut off from the outside world, and denied visits, phone calls, and even letters. And then they killed him. Even after that, they abused his body and abused his mother. On the one hand, the public murder has once again shown everyone that Putin is capable of anything, and that you cannot negotiate with him. (Applause) But on the other side, I can also see how shocked everyone is. Many people have the feeling that Putin cannot be defeated at all. And in this desperation, they are now asking me: ‘How can I help you?’ And I am thinking about how Alexei would answer this question. I will try to answer it, but to do so I have to tell you a little about what he was like. Alexei was an inventor. He always had new ideas for everything, but especially in politics. You have elections at the beginning of June. Many of you will be campaigning – meeting voters, giving interviews, shooting commercials. Now imagine that all of this is impossible. No TV station will do an interview with you. No money in the world can help you with a commercial. And the voters who came to the meetings will be arrested along with the candidate. Welcome to Putin’s Russia. (Applause) And yet Alexei Navalny has managed to become the most famous politician there. He was able to inspire millions of people with his ideas. How did he do that? He was always fantasising and experimenting. You’re not allowed on TV? Let’s learn how to make YouTube videos so the whole country can watch them. You’re not allowed to vote? You can come up with a tactical voting strategy to take seats away from the ruling party. Even in Putin’s gulag, Alexei managed to pass on ideas for projects that would make the Kremlin panic. He was the opposite of everything boring. This is the answer to the question. If you really want to defeat Putin, you have to become an innovator. You have to stop being boring. (Applause) You cannot hurt Putin with another resolution or another set of sanctions that is no different from the previous ones. You cannot defeat him by thinking he’s a man of principle who has morals and rules. He’s not like that, and Alexei realized that a long time ago. You are not dealing with a politician but with a bloody mobster. Putin is the leader of an organised criminal gang. Putin is the leader of... Sorry. (Applause) Thank you. It’s good to repeat it again: Putin is the leader of an organised criminal gang. This includes poisoners and assassins, but they’re just puppets. The most important thing is the people close to Putin: his friends, associates, and keepers of the mafia’s money. You, and all of us, must fight this criminal gang. And the political innovation here is to apply the methods of fighting organised crime, not political competition. Not diplomatic notes, but investigations into the financial machinations. Not statements of concern, but a search for mafia associates in your countries, for the discreet lawyers and financiers who are helping Putin and his friends to hide money. In this fight you have reliable allies – there are tens of millions of Russians who are against Putin, against the war, against the evil he brings. We must not persecute them – on the contrary, you must work with them. With us. (Applause) Putin must answer for what he has done to my country. Putin must answer for what he has done to a neighbouring, peaceful country. And Putin must answer for everything he has done to Alexei. (Applause) My husband will never see what the Beautiful Russia of the Future will look like, but we must see it. And I will do my best to make his dream come true, the evil will fall and the beautiful future will come. (The House rose and accorded the speaker a standing ovation)",-,2024-02-28,6.

Manfred Weber,"Madam President, Madam Navalnaya, I was informed about the death of Alexei Navalny at the beginning of the Munich Security Conference, Friday, 11.00. Andrius Kubilius sent me a text message. My first thought was, ‘This is not a coincidence. This is planned. This is the killer, Putin, behind.’ Last week was another final wake up call. No one today can be so naive to doubt about the brutal and murderous nature of Putin’s regime. Dear Mrs Navalnaya, our thoughts are with you and your children and all those who loved and admire your husband, Alexei Navalny. All of Europe mourns a brave man killed by a brutal regime. Alexei Navalny loved freedom, and for that he was deprived of it and locked up in prison. Alexei Navalny wanted a free Russia, that’s why he couldn’t be tolerated in Putin’s unfree Russia. Alexei Navalny believed in people and knew how to inspire them. That is why the Putin regime prevented him from speaking. Navalny was a hope for Russia, but above all, he had hope. He had hope that the corruption will not be unpunished. His work helped identify many of Putin’s friends who are now facing the toughest sanctions in Europe’s history. He had hope in a democratic future for Russia. He showed Russians that one man saying ‘no’ is enough to scare a regime. He had hope in power of truth, the truth that Putin hides, that Putin fears, but to which he will have to answer. Dear Mrs Navalnaya, we admire your courage. You are keeping alive the hope for a free and a democratic Russia. As Europeans, and as democrats, we will carry that hope with you together. Alexei Navalny died for freedom and democracy in Russia, just as people died for freedom and democracy in Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, in their fight against an unfree communism. Before 1988, not many could have imagined that once we would be here together, living in a free and democratic Europe. So what I want to say is, everything is possible. That is why we will never give up the dream of a free and democratic Russia.",PPE,2024-02-28,6.

Pedro Marques,"Madam President, Madam Navalnaya, today we pay tribute to Alexei Navalny, the 2021 Sakharov Prize laureate, for his courage and his ultimate sacrifice for democracy and for freedom in your country against the tyranny and the corruption of Putin’s regime. He paid the highest price with his own life, but his legacy will live through you, through your family, and it will be honoured through the Russian people. We express our heartfelt condolences to you, his brave wife, but also to your family. This House has repeatedly condemned, in the strongest possible terms, the persecution of Alexei Navalny, his poisoning, all the politically motivated rulings, the trump charges, calling for his immediate and unconditional release. But you challenged us here today, and we heard you loud and clear. That is something that I want to say to you. The news of his death in the hands of the Putin regime in a remote Siberian prison outraged us and was met with the strongest condemnation. It sent shockwaves, you know, around Russia, but around the world. We could witness it personally all over Europe. Alexei was a political leader, one of the most brave ones, with powerful convictions that inspired people, raising collective consciousness for what was happening and is still happening in Russia. He represented the hope and the vision for a different, for a better Russia. His death brings us back to the memories, the darkest moments in the Russian history and the conditions of his imprisonment and the violence he suffered makes Putin and the regime ultimately responsible for his fate. We demand an international and an independent investigation into the circumstances of his death, and for all responsible for his detention, for his treatment, and for his death to be held to account. Truth must be told, consequences must be borne and justice must be served. The memory of Alexei will live into the ages. He was a fighter, a fighter for democracy and a democratic Russia will prevail one day. Be brave, Madame Navalnaya.

Jaak Madison,"Madam President, Ms Navalnaya, first of all, from our political group, all the regrets goes to you and for your children, for your son and daughter, because the biggest loss what you can have is to lose your father as a children. So that’s why it was very emotional to listen to your statement and I agree that most of us will absolutely feel what you feel, even if it’s very hard for us to feel the same as you are doing. You were saying absolutely right things about Russia, the current Russia, what we have today. And the very sad story is that the independent polling stations have shown that too many people are still supporting the regime of Putin. They are supporting the ideas of the old imperialist Russia. There are about 70% of the people who are saying that, yes, we have to restore the great Russia and should have the same kind of borders that they had in history. But the other side of the coin is that almost 30% of the Russian people doesn’t like those ideas. It means that almost 30 million people in Russia would like to have a normal country with stability, with freedom and peace. And as I am from Estonia, of course we feel it like from the bones, like what is it like to live next to the country who would like to occupy you? But it gives hope also for us to have a normal future, normal cooperation, because I am sure that everybody here in this room would like to have a normal cooperation with the biggest country in the world that’s called Russia, to have a normalised relations, to have a normal economy, to have a normal friendship. And that’s also why I’m looking forward for the future, that maybe in the future, one day, it is possible to have normalised relations with our neighbours. And that gives the hope that there are still about 30 million people, including you, who are standing against this regime and hoping for a better Russia and a better future. I think I said enough, I really wish the best for you and for children, and I’m more than sure that one day we will have a great country called Russia who has no kind of imperialist ideas and will have normal relations with all the neighbours in Europe.",ID,2024-02-28,6.

Terry Reintke,"Madam President, dear colleagues, dear Yulia Navalnaya, it is hard to imagine what you have been going through in these last weeks, months, years. And when you were speaking about how you and your husband with your family were visiting Strasbourg a while ago and how you miss him right now, I was imagining what it would do to me if I lost my beloved partner to a brutal regime. And I know that probably it cannot even touch the pain that you have been feeling, but let me tell you on behalf of my whole group that we share this pain, we strongly support you and we are by your side in this difficult time. In order to keep your husband’s memory alive, we have to do everything in our power not only to demand an independent investigation, but also to protect the remaining political prisoners in Russia and all those who are suffering from this brutal regime. The murder of Alexei Navalny has made it clear yet again: the biggest enemy of Vladimir Putin is democracy, the biggest enemy of Vladimir Putin is freedom. Freedom and democracy are what Putin is most afraid of because they threaten his democratic rule and they were symbolised by your brave late husband. They threaten his system based on corruption and lies. So, our struggle has to be even more determined. Let us fight for our democracy and freedom here in Europe, but also let us stand in solidarity with all those fighting for it in Russia and elsewhere in the world. And even in this difficult time, when we all have difficult debates back home, when there are a lot of political challenges ahead of us, colleagues we can never forget the price that so many political prisoners in Russia, in Belarus and elsewhere are paying to fight for freedom and democracy. If they have the strength to fight and pay this price, we cannot be tired. If they have the strength to go on, we have to do all we can in order to support them because in the end of the day – I am sure and I want to say this to you – in the end of the day, freedom will win, there will be a free Russia and we will fight for it side by side together with you.",Greens/EFA,2024-02-28,6.

Mathieu Michel,"Mr President, honourable Members, Commissioner, it is an emotional day today. The European Union is outraged by the death of the Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, for which the ultimate responsibility lies with President Putin and the Russian authorities. Our thoughts are with his wife, Yulia Navalnaya, who honoured this Chamber with her presence today, his family, and with all those in Russia and beyond, who believe in a democratic and peaceful future for Russia. Alexei Navalny gave hope to democrats and civil society in Russia, which is why so many people from all over the country joined his actions and listened to his messages of another Russia. We will honour his memory as a freedom fighter. Russia must allow an independent and transparent international investigation into circumstances of his sudden death. We also repeat international calls on Russia to immediately and unconditionally release all other political prisoners held in similar horrific conditions. President, honourable Members, Commissioner, Yulia Navalnaya was also present at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting last week. She thanked the EU for our strong statements and support over the last three years. Her words were also a call for further actions. The EU will spare no efforts to hold Russia’s political leadership and authorities to account in close coordination with our partners, including through further sanctions. The EU global human rights sanctions regime enables the EU to address human rights violations and abuses around the world. It signals the EU’s strong determination to stand up for human rights. Through this regime, the EU is sending a clear message: there is a cost to serious human rights violations and abuses. Those listed are banned from entering the EU and have their assets frozen. Sanctions are part of a wider policy in order to bring about a change in conduct from those responsible. They are an important part of our response, albeit not the only one. The EU supports NGOs, civil society organisations, human rights defenders and independent journalists inside and outside Russia. EU support – our support – is crucial for those organisations to ensure legal defence for political prisoners, including citizens participating in demonstrations against the war on Ukraine. To all supporters of Mr Navalny who feel that they have lost hope following his death, I reassure you that the EU will continue to use its communication channels and the international human rights to reiterate our unequivocal position on the situation in Russia.",-,2024-02-28,11.

Kadri Simson,"Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, on 16 February we received very sad reports, by the state-controlled Russian media, of the sudden death of the Russian opposition politician and anti-corruption activist, Alexei Navalny, in Siberia. His tragic and unnecessary death was confirmed by his family and lawyer when they arrived the following day to this inhumane and grim penal colony, reminding us of dark Soviet times. Let me, once again, on behalf of the European Union, express my deepest condolences to Mr Navalny’s family, children, and friends, and all those who worked with him for the benefit of their country. We admire the bravery of Mr Navalny. The EU has repeatedly called on the Russian authorities for his immediate and unconditional release, pointing to the dangerous conditions where he and other Russian political prisoners are held. Our colleagues in Moscow have tried in vain to reach out to Russian authorities on his case. They have been observing the politically motivated court hearings in Moscow. Through his life, Alexei Navalny demonstrated incredible courage and determination through his anti-corruption work across Russia, spreading a message that inspired many, especially young people. He represented the possibility of a different Russia. In October 2020, the EU was the first to adopt sanctions to respond to the assassination attempt of Mr. Navalny, after he was poisoned with a toxic nerve agent. Moreover, the very first listings in March 2021, adopted under the EU Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime, were also related to the case of Mr Navalny. Since then, we have further expanded our sanctions, addressing his case, and we will continue to do so in response to his death. These sanctions are also meant to complement other tools: the EU’s substantial support to civil society, human rights defenders and independent media inside and outside Russia. The EU is committed to continue supporting NGOs, civil society organisations, human rights defenders and independent journalists. Russian NGOs receive support from the EU, for example, for legal defence for political prisoners, including citizens participating in anti-war demonstrations. Russian human rights defenders also receive EU support for temporary relocation, trainings and urgent practical assistance, and for monitoring the human rights situation in Russia. The EU supports Russian-language independent media and journalists. We will continue keeping the international pressure on Russia for the human rights violations and supporting individuals, including through trial observation. Mr Navalny’s death makes us even more committed to continue this essential support. Honourable Members, we join international calls, by the UN Secretary-General and other UN bodies, on Russia to allow for a full, transparent and credible investigation. We also urge Russia to immediately and unconditionally release all other political prisoners. Mr Navalny’s death is yet another sign of the accelerating and systematic repression in Russia. Our answer will be our continued and substantial support to Russian civil society, human rights defenders and independent media inside and outside Russia, and to hold those responsible of Navalny’s death to account.",-,2024-02-28,11.

Today, freedom is costing the most for the Ukrainian people. Putin is trying to kill hope that Russia can be different in every way he can. Putin has used Alexei’s body to mock and bully. He mocked his extremely strong mother, Lyudmila Navalnaya. This reminds us of our history of bloody Soviet occupation, the communist Russia, when the bodies of Lithuanian freedom fighters were desecrated, when mothers could not pick them up, lying in open air in front of churches. Putin is trying to show that we are helpless. There are around 700 political prisoners in Russia, including Vladimir Kara-Murza and Ilya Yashin. Their lives are all in danger. Over 1 400 are in Lukashenka’s prisons. Their lives are also in danger. The murder of Navalny should not frighten us, but mobilise us in a common struggle for freedom. Our freedom is also threatened.

This is a celebration because they have joined a security collaboration within Europe. Azerbaijan’s recent aggression poses a threat not to just the territorial integrity of Armenia, but also challenges the very existence of Armenia. Armenia’s decision last week to freeze its participation in the Collective Security Treaty Organisation brings to light a reality that I’ve long emphasised – that Russia is not a reliable ally of Armenia. Russia is not a friend of Armenia; Europe is a friend of Armenia.

And Armenia is European through and through, with its values, its culture and, I’m sure, with its future. Wedged between brutal autocracy, Armenia is a beacon of democracy that we must cherish and protect. Unfortunately, in the region where bloodshed is the norm, Armenia’s survival is not guaranteed. As expected, Russia backstabbed Armenia when greenlighting the ethnic cleansing of Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. That is why we, the European Union, must offer Armenia a path to a European future that guarantees security and prosperity. This will be a manifestation of historical justice – Armenia rejoining its and our European family after so many centuries. This is not an easy path, but we can start with the first firm steps. Visa-free travel for Armenians, followed by deeper economic integration and fostering personal and social connections that will ensure the next generation of Armenians already reaps European benefits.

Andrey Kovatchev,"Mr President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, we have always strongly supported the Armenian reforms towards establishing a stable, well-functioning democracy, while also advocating for peace in the region and the end of the hostilities with Azerbaijan. From one side, it is important to note the cynical behaviour of Russia. Armenia relied on its commitment and was heavily deceived. This logically led to the brave step of Prime Minister Pashinyan to suspend Armenia’s membership of the Moscow-controlled Collective Security Treaty Organisation. Russia has never been a true friend and ally of Armenia, and has always followed its own imperialistic agenda in the region and in the world. On the other side, the EU has a strong interest in a politically stable and economically prosperous Southern Caucasus. In this regard, deepening EU-Armenia relations is vital. The EU is the largest developing cooperation donor in Armenia and its second trading partner. EU-Armenia relations have never been stronger, and a comprehensive and enhanced partnership agreement has been used by Armenia as a blueprint for a domestic reform agenda. At the same time, Armenia’s relations with Azerbaijan remain a major obstacle for Armenia’s socio-economic development and stability in the region. I support the efforts of Prime Minister Pashinyan to continue bilateral and multilateral discussions with Azerbaijan in order to reach a peaceful agreement between the two neighbours, which must uphold the three principles established in the Helsinki Final Act: non-use of force; territorial integrity; and equal rights of self-determination of peoples. What we are currently doing for, and together with, Armenia is only the start. We need to deepen our work in the field of economy, finance, social affairs, security and defence. Armenia is not alone. We should also lift the visa for Armenian citizens as soon as possible. EU is with Armenia and with the brave people of Armenia. (The speaker concluded in a non-EU language)",PPE,2024-02-27,16.

Azerbaijan also imports 65 % of its oil to European countries. But within our energetic mix, they are just under the category of ‘others’. Do you see it? We are not, by any stretch, dependent on Aliyev imports. The only one who benefits from all of this is Aliyev himself. Now compare: as a result of ethnic cleansing, more than 140 000 Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh were forced to flee their homes and were starved for months during the Lachin corridor blockade. This is not even the classic dilemma between our own stability and prosperity and between human rights.

We need to congratulate the bravery of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan’s statements and steps, which are bringing Armenia closer to the European Union. The European Parliament should respond politically and propose an ambitious agenda for the future of EU relations with Armenia. Our political responsibility is to address Armenia’s European aspirations, shared by the Armenian people, and our wish is to have Armenia as part of the European family, enjoying the full benefits of European integration. The EU needs to develop a new step-by-step roadmap to prepare Armenia for rapprochement with the EU, including its candidate status. It is obvious, from another side, that Russia will angrily react to such a brave behaviour of Armenia, and there will be security and economic challenges to Armenia.

The recent agreement on the exchange of prisoners, bilateral meetings held in Munich, and the upcoming peace talks in Berlin are steps in the right direction to normalise relations. But the key to a peace agreement lies in negotiations under the auspices of multilateral bodies that can help, and with our help and help from our transatlantic partners, act as an honest broker in this process. Now, it is important that we insist that both sides respect each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and are deterred from aggressive rhetoric and provocation that could destabilise the region. The agreement on the delimitation of borders is an important aim to achieve during this process in order to put these issues behind us. We call on Azerbaijan to refrain from any unilateral actions and allow the presence of international European monitoring missions from its side of the border. The EU monitoring mission to Armenia today plays a strong role in that regard and I welcome the recent increase in the number of EU observers in the country.

Since then, the EU continues to call for a real political process as the only response to the Syrian conflict, and to support the efforts of UN special Envoy Pedersen to advance on all aspects of UN Security Council Resolution 2254. We encourage him to reconvene the Constitutional Committee. The reality is that the Assad regime has shown no intention to engage in any political process, even after its readmission to the League of Arab States last year. As a result, the overall situation in Syria continues to re-deteriorate. The EU position on Syria has not changed and will not change. This means no normalisation with Damascus, no lifting of sanctions and no support for reconstruction in the absence of a credible, sustainable and inclusive political process in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2254. Support to the Syrian people continues to be a fundamental priority of EU action. The EU and its Member States remains the largest donor, having mobilised over EUR 30 billion since 2011. Against this backdrop, the EU is organising this spring the eighth Brussels conference on Syria, which remains an essential occasion to reaffirm our unity and commitment to a political transition in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2254, and a key opportunity to engage with Syrian civil society. The conference remains key to generate pledges for assistance to Syrians and their host communities. Several major donors have announced significant cuts in funding, and we are facing a funding gap. It will be important that the EU continues to be seen as a strong supporter of the Syrian people. The Day of Dialogue will take place on 30 April and the ministerial on 27 May. The Day of Dialogue is an essential platform to engage with Syrian civil society, and parliamentarians are also invited to attend it.",-,2024-02-27,"17.

Lukas Mandl,"Mr President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, I want to explicitly thank Nathalie Loiseau for her excellent work as a rapporteur on this Syria report, which is crucial and important for the security also of the Europeans, the security of the world and, of course, the future of the people of Syria. I have visited Damascus and the greater Damascus region two years ago. Immediately after that, I have talked to Nathalie Loiseau in order to implement especially the recommendations of international organisations active on the ground in Syria, especially United Nations organisations such as FAO or the Red Cross and others. I had the privilege to talk to – on site – those who had a clear impression on how humanitarian aid works and how it would not work. It works locally, it works regionally, it works when it addresses small and middle-sized enterprises and entities. It works when it addresses civil society and especially the education sector. This is also something we have implemented into this very report of the European Parliament on Syria. Secondly, I want to emphasise that the vast majority of refugees around the world are today Syrian refugees and the vast majority of them – around 80%, as experts tell us – want to go home. They would wish to go home and to have proper dwelling in their very home country, Syria, again, but they are reluctant to do so because they are afraid of violence due to the various tensions within society. Of course, on top of these threats is the Assad regime itself. It’s a threat to the world, it’s a threat to the region, it’s aligning with the ones who are threatening Europe such as Russia and others. This is also what the report obviously addresses, including, among final remarks of the report, also, the Aramaic language, which is a minority language – it’s about to disappear on this planet.

Jutta Urpilainen,"Mr President, honourable Members, we are at a historic moment in the EU-Armenia relations. They have never been stronger than today. This was confirmed two weeks ago at the fifth EU-Armenia Partnership Council. Back in October, in this plenary. Prime Minister Pashinyan delivered a very clear message: Armenia is ready to move closer to the European Union. In response, the European Council tasked the High Representative and the Commission to explore ways to strengthen EU-Armenia relations in all their dimensions. Over the past months, we have been working to deliver. The road ahead may at times be challenging. Armenia’s past decisions, which have resulted in political, economic and security dependencies cannot be overcome overnight, but the clear political will on both sides will allow us to advance in deepening and broadening our partnership. We already have a good basis, a solid framework – our EU-Armenia Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement. And together with Armenia, we have launched the preparation of an ambitious new EU-Armenia partnership agenda. Honourable Members, we have proposed that this new partnership agenda, based on our common values, should be composed of three building blocks. First, we will work to strengthen Armenia’s resilience and diversify its economy through increased cooperation in trade, energy, connectivity and aviation safety. For enhanced people-to-people contacts, we are discussing options to start a visa liberalisation dialogue. Armenia has expressed its strong interest in this, and we encourage its leadership to step up work on the relevant reforms. The launching of the visa liberalisation dialogue would send an important political signal to Armenian citizens, and it would provide leverage for further reforms. Secondly, security is an increasingly important element of our relations. We are celebrating the first anniversary of the EU mission in Armenia and look forward to its reinforcement, and are considering a possible European peace facility measure. We are scaling up our dialogue on foreign and security policy, also looking into participation in EU-led missions and operations. Thirdly, stepping up investments will be key for closer economic cooperation. We are committed to supporting Armenia’s participation in the Black Sea electricity cable and other regional connectivity projects. Creating closer links between the countries of the region has a strong potential to serve as dividends for peace. The EU also continues to support Karabakh Armenians. We provided EUR 12.2 million to address urgent humanitarian needs, and we have set aside an additional EUR 5.5 million. For socioeconomic needs, we provided EUR 50 million in budget support. Our strong commitment to the Armenia-Azerbaijan normalisation process remains unchanged. We stand ready to support a sustainable and lasting peace based on the principles of recognition of sovereignty, inviolability of borders and territorial integrity of both countries. We reject any use of force or the threat to use force, and continue to support peaceful conflict resolution.",-,2024-02-27,16.

For instance, should we prioritise private diplomacy or public pressure? Should we re-evaluate an agreement? Should we impose sanctions? Should we even cut relations? I believe each case demands an individual assessment, and this is how we work in the European Union. What is clear is that our efforts need to be result-oriented, as you highlight in this report. We need to be coherent in our actions. Our dialogues with our international partners represent one of the most important tools to focus on human rights and to call for them to be respected. But these dialogues are not a standalone tool. The EU continues to use all its instruments to reinforce our action wherever necessary, and this Parliament is a crucial ally in this endeavour and continues to inspire our work.

Clare Daly,"Mr President, human rights are universal. That means everyone enjoys them equally. But the EU doesn’t believe in that anymore. In 2020, Ursula von der Leyen announced the EU’s new geopolitical agenda on human rights and democracy. These days, the EU is all about the rules-based international order, all about geopolitics. So when the European Council President Charles Michel congratulated vicious, old-school Azerbaijani dictator and ethnic cleanser of Nagorno-Karabakh Ilham Aliyev earlier this month on his ‘re-election’, that’s the EU’s geopolitical agenda on human rights and democracy in action. If your human rights are geopolitical rather than universal, then there’s no contradiction at all between, say, supporting a genocide in Gaza or congratulating a war criminal on his rigging of an election and then turning around a minute later and screaming at human rights abuses in Iran and Russia. In this agenda, human rights are only a stick to beat the people you don’t like with.

We must remember the citizens of Gaza and their suffering today. They are being denied essential items such as food, water, fuel and medicine, and confined in an intolerable situation. And their situation is a violation of Israel’s obligations under international humanitarian law. We must continue to be vocal in defending human rights, particularly as we witness the prevalence of authoritarian regimes across our world and the repression of civil society. Regrettably, we can pinpoint to the erosion of women’s rights and the rights of minorities under such regimes. Globally, the number of democracies is shrinking and as a result, we are seeing more and more conflicts breaking out with devastating humanitarian consequences.

But even we should do more. And I would like to recall the demand by this Parliament to establish a category of humanitarian visas in the context of the report of our colleague Hannah Neumann on human rights defenders. And I think it’s time that we now make this happen, because so many people who come from Russia, from Belarus, from Afghanistan, from Iran, really need temporary protection. It is not necessarily at all about asylum, but people need to get away from the countries that are dangerous for their work for human rights. I also wanted to say a word about another dimension of human rights and their defence. You know, colleagues, tomorrow, the famous Directive on corporate sustainability due diligence might be voted in the Council and it is not at all guaranteed that there will be the required majority. Why I want to tell you this today is that no state alone can solve the challenges of human rights. We need the corporations on board and that is why we need to take this very seriously.

Janez Lenarčič,"Madam President, honourable Members, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Sánchez Amor, and also other Members who have contributed to this report on human rights and democracy. As it states in this report, the human rights situation is worsening across the world. We all have received the news of the death of Alexei Navalny in Russia with consternation. And today, the EU continues working to address many other human rights abuses and humanitarian law violations in countries worldwide. Your report includes a long list of countries and cases from China to Belarus, from Afghanistan to Nicaragua, and so on. We just spoke, under the previous item, on the Israel-Gaza war. What is clear is that all cases deserve our full attention and there should be no hierarchy of victims. At the same time, democratic backsliding continues from the military coup in the Sahel region to the unsuccessful attempts to thwart the democratic transition of power in Guatemala. Alternative narratives try to change universally agreed human rights law and challenge the international order. The UN and its Secretary-General have the full support of the European Union. We are leading the necessary reforms, building alliances with partners across continents, and in particular, we are ensuring a better involvement of the Global South. Honourable Members, the European Union cannot impose radical changes on third countries. What we can do is keep all possible channels of communication open with the different parties and continue to develop our toolbox and instruments in support of human rights and democracy. The EU action plan on human rights and democracy has been reinforced financially through the Global Europe Human Rights and Democracy programme, with EUR 1.5 billion for 2021 to 2027. Last December, the 25th EU-NGO forum gathered 250 human rights defenders worldwide on youth as actors of change for human rights. It also commemorated the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirmed the EU’s commitment to uphold and advance human rights. At the very first Council of Foreign Affairs, in the mandate of the High Representative, he proposed the creation of an EU human rights sanctions regime to hold those responsible for gross violations of human rights accountable. With the political support from this Parliament, it was swiftly approved. Since 2020, the EU has used this sanctions regime to impose restrictive measures against perpetrators around the world, including in China, in Russia, in Libya, South Sudan and Eritrea and also against the Wagner Group. And last week, the EU adopted a 13th package of sanctions against Russia, against its political leadership and authorities and we decided to rename the global human rights sanctions regime after Alexei Navalny. Fighting impunity remains one of our priorities. Last December, we signed a four-year EUR 20 million project: the global initiative to fight against impunity for international crimes. This will complement our ongoing support to the International Criminal Court. Honourable Members, we could not succeed in any of this without human rights defenders. Since 2015, the EU human rights defenders protection mechanism has supported 66 000 human rights defenders and their families. And you can rest assured that we will continue doing so wherever defenders are in urgent need. Electoral observers also deserve a particular mention as human rights defenders, and also in the name of the High Representative, I wish to thank each and every Member of this Parliament who participated in the EU election observation missions and carried the EU flag across the world in defence of democracy. In 2023, the EU continued its efforts to help improve electoral processes throughout the world through our electoral observation missions. Although these have to operate in increasingly challenging contexts, they continue to be a bulwark against democratic backsliding, as demonstrated, for instance, by our mission to Guatemala. This mission played an important role to preserve the results of the elections and allow for an orderly transfer of power to the newly elected president. For their efforts and professionalism, the EU mission to Guatemala received the Wilson Centre Award. The EU and this Parliament should be proud of this. Dear Members, the case of Guatemala indeed is worth a particular mention. Last week we had the honour and pleasure to receive the newly elected President of Guatemala, Bernardo Arévalo. He acknowledged the decisive role played by the EU in upholding a democratic electoral process and in ensuring respect for the electoral results. At the same time, the European Union has imposed sanctions on those individuals who attempted to undermine the peaceful transition of power in Guatemala, holding them accountable. This is one more clear example of what we can achieve as the European Union when we act together with one voice and combine our different EU foreign policy tools in a principled and coherent manner. There is much more work to do. Your report includes a long list of countries and challenges to address. Time does not allow me to go through them all, but you can rest assured that we will take very good note of your report as well as of your suggestions.",-,2024-02-27,14.

In the current context of the crisis in Cuba and global geopolitical instability, the objectives of our agreement remain absolutely relevant – to strengthen our bilateral relations, to encourage reforms and accompany the process of economic and social modernisation of the island, and to promote our values and to safeguard our interests. As our Joint Council showed, the agreement provides the space to have open and frank discussions at the highest level, to identify the areas of our shared interest and try to overcome our differences. Our approach with Cuba is the same as with many other countries, based on the EU’s values and interests. With the occasion of the EU-Cuba Joint Council, the HR/VP and the Special Representative for Human Rights met with the Cuban authorities, as well as with critical voices of Cuban society, who shared their worries and hopes. The EU reiterates its concerns about the human rights situation in Cuba. We conveyed this message to the Cuban authorities and expect concrete results. At the same time, the economic and social situation in Cuba continues to deteriorate. We shared with the Cuban authorities the urgent need to undertake bold reforms. We stand ready to support these reforms through our cooperation, including Global Gateway, to help improving the living conditions of Cuban citizens. We are supporting the Cuban emerging private sector. Since 2021, more than 10 000 small and medium-sized companies have been created. This entrepreneurship is necessary for economic growth, an important step towards more ambitious reforms. Other factors have aggravated the situation in the country. These include the US embargo and inclusion of the country on the list of State Sponsors of Terrorism. The EU rejects these measures, as we expressed once again on the 2 November 2023 at the United Nations. There are many other objectives that the EU and Cuba defend at international level, starting by the need to reinforce the multilateral system and to promote the strategic partnership between the EU and CELAC. Clearly, EU-Cuba relations must also be framed in the current geopolitical context. Regarding the Russian aggression against Ukraine, the EU spares no opportunity to state its position: Russia is the aggressor. Ukraine is the victim. Despite its own analysis and historical closeness to Moscow, Cuba has already abstained in four different votes at the UN on Russia’s war against Ukraine. We certainly expect more, and we will continue conveying our message to Cuba in future exchanges in the framework of our agreement.",-,2024-02-27,18.

Tilly Metz,"Madam President, dear colleagues, dear Commissioner I really wonder what is really the reason for this debate tonight. Although it is true that the human rights situation remains concerning, can we really compare the situation on the island to other topics we are debating tonight? I welcome the efforts by Josep Borrell and Eamon Gilmore to engage in a constructive but critical dialogue with Cuba. Many challenges still exist, and we are particularly concerned about the situation of political prisoners and call for their release. But we are also concerned about the very difficult humanitarian situation, on the island because of the United States blockade. It will take time, but we should continue to engage in dialogue. Through parliamentary diplomacy, we have engaged in constructive talks with Cuba about an official visit of the European Parliament. I deeply regret it has not yet been possible to reach an agreement about the visit, and I hope that we, as Parliament, will be able to find a decent solution to this so as not to break the channels that we have opened until now.",Greens/EFA,2024-02-27,18.

Alfred Sant,"The Hamas attack on Israeli communities on 7 October 2023 was an atrocity that must be condemned without reservation. Israel could only regard it as an act of war and take action accordingly. How Israel has done this, however, should be condemned. War has been conducted by the Israeli Government in a totally disproportionate manner against the Palestinian people living in Gaza, whom it has controlled in an authoritarian manner for the last decades. In breach of the rules of war, there has been a total disregard for civilian casualties, which have reached disastrous levels, with most being women and children. Israeli claims that civilian deaths are inevitable collateral damage or due to Hamas using civilians as buffers are not tenable. Indeed, they give credence to counter-claims that the Israeli strategy is defined by revenge and carries a genocidal intent, within the context of Israel having degenerated into an apartheid state. The attempt by Israel to blank UNRWA out of the situation heightens the credence of such statements. To be coherent with its proclaimed values, the EU should give concrete expression to a condemnation of Israeli actions by immediately suspending the Israeli-EU association agreement and advising Member States against the supply of war material to that country.",S&D,2024-02-27,"12.

Sophia in 't Veld,"Mr President, I have to confess I feel a little bit like in the twilight zone. In my fairly outdated idea of democracy, it would be a scandal if Members of Parliament are being hacked and spied upon. Yet, in contrast to Qatargate, when third countries were trying to take influence on the decisions of this House, we’re having a late-night debate. The Commissioner, sorry to say so, is not in charge, the Council is gloriously absent and a handful of Members are here. Members of Parliament... I wasn’t talking to you. Members of Parliament... can I, please? Can you have a minimum of respect, maybe? Members of Parliament being spied upon is a scandal and it is not the first time.

Because the Commission was reluctant to take the toys away from the national governments who are using spyware to spy on political opponents, journalists, NGOs, lawyers and what have you. I don’t know what to say anymore. The Commission has done nothing. The Council is not even here. Members of Parliament are being spied upon. I mean, what can I say? The responsible Commissioner isn’t even here. What kind of debate is this? Colleagues, I think we’re having a big problem here in the European Union, a problem of democracy.

Jutta Urpilainen,"Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission strongly condemns any illegal access to interpersonal communications or other data stored on users’ devices. We consider that any attempt to illegally access the data of citizens, including Members of this House and staff of EU institutions, if confirmed, is unacceptable. The Commission has taken note of recent revelations alleging that Members and staff of this House were targeted by mobile phone surveillance software, and this is especially worrying as we are approaching the elections for Parliament. As the Commission recently affirmed in its December recommendation on elections, surveillance and spyware tools must not be used to interfere with the democratic debate. The use of spyware can, under certain conditions, be a matter of national security. Such tools can be important weapons against crime, for instance when combating terrorism or high-level criminal networks. But using spyware has to be duly justified. Spyware is a particularly intrusive technology, and its use requires the highest standard of scrutiny. We have sought to address this issue in several recent legislative proposals. There are strong specific safeguards for journalists and media professionals in Article 4 of the recently agreed European Media Freedom Act. The ePrivacy Directive prohibits the interception of communications and the storage of and access to information in terminal equipment without the prior consent of the users concerned. Where the Directive is not applicable, Member States are bound by the guarantees laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights and by their national law. In its 2023 Rule of Law report, the Commission underlines that even where the use of spyware is linked to national security, there is a need for national checks and balances to ensure that safeguards are in place. Our other recently agreed instrument, the Cyber Resilience Act, aims to establish cybersecurity requirements for the market access in the EU of hardware and software, and sets out corresponding obligations for the manufacturers of these products. It will further contribute to reducing the attack surface of hardware and software that spyware is trying to exploit. We are continuing our efforts to strengthen export controls on cybersurveillance items from the EU to third countries under the term of the modernised Dual Use Regulation of 2021. As announced in this House, the Commission will bring forward a text clarifying the boundaries of and the interplay between EU law, in particular the data protection and national security, and this has been explained in the Commission official reply to the Parliament resolution on the issue. We believe that EU data protection law is fully applicable when fundamental freedoms come into play through the processing of personal data by private entities, and when law enforcement authorities process personal data for law enforcement and criminal justice purposes. Where data protection law does not apply, Member States are bound by the guarantees laid down in the European Convention of Human Rights and in their national law. Finally, we welcome efforts across the institutions to provide more robust defences and checks to ensure that any attempts to spy on democratic processes are quickly identified and addressed. Thank you very much for your attention, and I am looking forward to our debate.",-,2024-02-27,21.

Jutta Urpilainen,"Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for this interesting exchange. I can tell you that I have listened very carefully to your recommendations, and I welcome the overwhelming support to tackle inequalities as a priority. All my political engagement as Commissioner for International Partnership, including last week in Angola for the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, show that fighting inequalities is a central concern to us and our partner countries. It also shows that inequality needs to be better embedded in policy dialogues and strategies, pursuing a 360-degree approach, just like the Global Gateway does, and that it needs to be more systematically followed, also at the operational level. I personally believe that this Inequality Marker, I-Marker tool, I mentioned earlier will help us in this work. But, indeed, we must also continue to tackle the issue by promoting a fair global economy, investing in people and the planet, and promoting inclusive democracy. The upcoming United Nations Summit of the Future will place global inequalities front and centre on the international agenda. But above all, we must accelerate our efforts. It will take strong leadership and courage to get us over the line, but I believe that together we can definitely make the difference. We have to invest more in young generations, and this is what we are doing through our global Youth Action Plan, as well as investing in education. You remember I decided to increase our funding to education from 7% to 13%, so we are now investing in education globally with over EUR 6 billion, and the aim is: leave no one behind – so that where you are born does not determine who you will become.

Neoliberalism is a project of the ruling class to increase its power and profits on a global scale. Too often, the better off blame the poor for being poor, but the truth lies elsewhere. The developed North imposes conditions of exclusion on the Global South. We are rich because they are poor; 4.6 billion people in the world today are living on less than USD 5 a day. If they were better off, we wouldn’t have quite as much wealth. We are still robbing the Global South blind. Colonialism hasn’t stopped.

Instead of misogynist language, we’ll have ableist language. We’ll get a constitutional provision that says care is the family’s problem, not society’s.

Sirpa Pietikäinen,"Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank you and congratulate the Commission for this excellent activity. Poverty is, of course, exclusion from adequate financial resources, but it is much, much more. It is exclusion from education, it is exclusion from proper work, it is exclusion from necessary healthy diets, from health care, and it is exclusion from our societies and decision making. Combating poverty is extremely important, because poverty – understood in the larger context – is a violation against human rights. So yes, we do have a moral duty to work to implement the SDGs and to fight against poverty. But we do have a self-interest to do that also, because we cannot sustain civilised civilisation with increasing poverty and separation between different groups of people. We cannot solve environmental problems and we cannot implement Green Deal. We cannot build our societies with all the full intellectual capacity and the work capacity, what the people would have. Just to put it very boldly: we cannot build our human world and we cannot solve any of our problems without tackling poverty. And as you, Commissioner, said, yes, we do have the money, we hopefully do have the will and we do have the means and equal proportional taxation global wide and combating tax evasion is an important part of that.

Jutta Urpilainen,"Mr President, honourable Members, global inequality is rising. According to Oxfam’s latest report, since 2020 the world’s five richest men have doubled their wealth. At the same time, nearly 5 billion people have become poorer. Just 10% of countries are on track to meet SDG 10 on tackling inequalities, and no country met SDG 5 on gender equality. From the pandemic to conflicts to climate change, multiple crises have reversed the hard-won progress of the last decade. As the Commissioner for International Partnerships reducing global inequalities is my top goal. It is an issue impacting every aspect of sustainable development. Therefore, the EU has embarked on a multidimensional response. First, we launched the Global Gateway investment strategy. Global Gateway is the EU’s EUR 300 billion contribution to achieving the 2030 agenda and reducing inequalities – and as the first SDG Voluntary Review on external action demonstrated, we are delivering. Team Europe is implementing equality flagships around the globe, from social cohesion to decent work, from just transition to human-centred digitalisation. Second, we launched ambitious external policies and programmes to support equality globally. The EU works both bilaterally and multilaterally to implement fair tax systems. When everyone pays their fair share countries have more capital to invest in education, public health systems and stronger social protection. And the EU is at the forefront of the reform of the multilateral development banks so access to sustainable finance is facilitated for vulnerable countries. We pay special attention to those most at risk of inequalities. Through our Gender Action Plan III we work to ensure that all women and girls can exercise full, equal, and meaningful participation in public and private life. Through the Global Health Strategy, the EU works to put SDG 3 back on track and, with our first ever Youth Action Plan, we put young people in the driving seat of the global recovery by engaging, empowering and connecting them. Finally, last year, DG INTPA introduced the Inequality Marker or I-Marker. It is an innovative tool that tracks and benchmarks the EU’s impact across all sectors on inequalities. It forces us to ask ourselves, does our intervention target the bottom poorest 40%? How does it benefit those groups that are the most disadvantaged? We will receive the first I-Marker results by spring, and we will use them to design targeted external actions that drive progress. We will also work with the Brazilian presidency of the G20, who has inequality as the top priority to present the I-Marker as a possible tool for our partners. So, honourable Members, global inequalities are rising but they do not have to and we can do more. We have the financial resources. We have the expertise to change the trend. We only need to match them with political will. I very much look forward to the discussion.",-,2024-02-27,20.

Jutta Urpilainen,"Mr President, honourable Members, I think the debate today actually illustrates the complexity of the conflict in eastern DRC and the situation in the broader Great Lakes. It equally illustrates the importance of addressing the root causes of this conflict, such as the trafficking of natural resources, which indeed feeds more governance and the armed groups themselves. So regarding this MOU on critical raw materials with Rwanda, one of the main objectives of the MOU on critical raw materials is to support the sustainable and responsible sourcing, production and processing of raw materials and the goal is to increase traceability and transparency and to reinforce the fight against illegal trafficking of minerals. And it’s good to remember that this follows the partnership on Critical Raw Materials with DRC in October. So we have signed the MOU both with DRC and with Rwanda on critical raw materials. So these efforts, which we sustain also with our support to the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region and our own provision on conflict minerals and due diligence, among others, are in the interest of all the countries and populations in the region. In line with its renewed strategy for the Great Lakes region, the EU will continue to contribute to help end the conflict and promote peace, democracy and sustainable development by contributing to the transformation of the key root causes of insecurity and instability into shared opportunities for unlocking the region’s full potential.

In Western Sahara, Morocco’s renewable energy projects are also used to greenwash human rights abuses. This infrastructure serves to further entrench Morocco in occupation with the obvious complication of foreign capital, complicity of foreign capital and the shameful approval of the EU. The EU allocates millions of euros in subsidies and aid to Morocco and to a multitude of European companies that invest in Western Sahara. This makes the EU a financier and accomplice to an illegal occupation. The EU is blatantly ignoring international law in Western Sahara.",The Left,2024-02-27,19.

Malte Gallée,"Madam President, it is quite exactly ten years ago that I was travelling through Tanzania, through Uganda and through Rwanda and I really wanted to go and see eastern Congo because I was always so interested – where are all our resources coming from that we are using on a daily basis in all our technical devices? But I was unable to cross the border to eastern Congo because the M23 just emerged. And over the years, so many people always ask, ‘Yeah, but why should we care from Europe what is happening in eastern Congo?’ And we have the historical duty to care about these people over there and we have to make sure that the geopolitical interests are solved – right now. It cannot be that coltan is transported from the DRC to Rwanda and then exported to the European Union. We need clear supply chain transparency and make sure that each and every one in DRC, Congo, is profiting from the richness of the country.

Jutta Urpilainen,"Madam President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, the EU is appalled by the increased military build-up and spike of violence in the eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the tragic consequences the population is once again forced to endure. This intensification of violence has created new waves of mass displacement and has further deteriorated the already worrying humanitarian situation. Serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law multiply within a context of complete impunity. The European Union has stepped up its humanitarian response, has made EUR 100 million available for 2023. But many of the most vulnerable still do not receive the support they need due to the gravity of the crisis and overwhelming needs. I was in Angola last week and discussed with the Vice-President and several ministers the latest tensions between DRC and Rwanda. I have firmly reiterated our support to the Luanda and Nairobi processes. Following the signature of the Critical Raw Materials MOU with Rwanda last week and my discussions in Luanda, I will engage with the President of DRC later this week in Brussels. We associate ourselves with the statement of the African Union Commission Chairperson of 21 February. There is no military solution to this crisis. Only an inclusive political dialogue that can address the root causes of insecurity and instability, the comprehensive implementation of the decisions taken within the frame of the Luanda and Nairobi processes and the respect of the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of all the countries in the region, can break the cycle of violence and impunity once and for all. The EU reaffirms its strong support to the Luanda and Nairobi processes and calls for their quick relaunch. Existing roadmaps must be implemented. Existing verification mechanisms must be reactivated. The EU reiterates its condemnation of the actions by all armed groups that operate in eastern DRC. Those groups must cease hostilities, withdraw from the areas they occupy, lay down their weapons and be integrated in a disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration process. All states in the region must cease any support, direct or indirect, to those armed groups. Rwanda must immediately withdraw its troops from DRC, cease all support to M23 and use all the means at its disposal to pressure this group to stop, withdraw and disarm. Similarly, the DRC must cease any support and cooperation with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda and other armed groups, and ensure its population is protected from harm. DRC authorities must ensure that the instructions it issued to its armed forces last November with regard to the FDLR be fast implemented. A final word to reiterate once again and in absolute terms our condemnation of hate speech and xenophobia, as well as ethnic-based narratives and politics. According to some experts, the level of hate speech and ethnic violence reminds the worst pages of history in this region, where we are about to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the genocide against the Tutsi. More than ever, we urge all political and civil society actors, including at the highest level, to refrain from such narratives and to intensify efforts against this.",-,2024-02-27,19.

Clare Daly,"Madam President, of course, the situation in Cuba is critical. The economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed on Cuba by the United State for over 60 years violates the rights of all Cubans. An estimated 500 000 people emigrated in 2022 and 2023. The important tourism sector hasn’t recovered. The serious shortage of fuel has disturbed the distribution of food and caused hunger. The energy crisis has led to daily periods of mandatory power cuts, all orchestrated by US actions. It is a real bloodletting and the extraterritorial sanctions imposed by the US on European companies and citizens dealing with Cuba are being implemented in complete illegality. If the EU cares about rule of law, you should be demanding a lifting of the blockade, not trying to interfere with Cuba’s sovereign decision making in terms of matters of foreign affairs. Cuba has withstood an assault for 60 years. It holds the solidarity of people all over the world and they will prevail. (Pyynnöstä myönnettävät puheenvuorot päättyvät)",The Left,2024-02-27,18.

Mick Wallace,"Madam President, the US and their allies imposed unilateral sanctions to punish the people for supporting their government, to strangle the country until the people see no other option but to abandon their belief that independence is possible, so that they come to the realisation that, in a world dominated by financial capital, democracy means one thing: the exposure of your country, its people and its resources to the exploitation of the predatory global capitalist regime. These totalitarian coercive measures decimate development and undermine the basic human rights of entire populations. The right-wing forces besieging the country then blame the results on the government under attack. For 62 years, this has been the formula for Cuba. US sanctions amount to crimes against humanity: whether it’s genocide in Gaza , killing hundreds of thousands of the weakest in societies through regime change or sanctions in Venezuela, Iran, Syria, North Korea, Zimbabwe, Yemen or Cuba, the totalitarian US regime and their puppets spread terror and call it democracy promotion.",The Left,2024-02-27,18.

Janez Lenarčič,"Madam President, honourable Members, thank you for this important debate. A few comments and some facts from my side. After the ICJ – International Court of Justice – issued its orders back on 26 January, the European Commission and the High Representative issued immediately a joint statement, stating that – I quote – ‘Orders of the ICJ are binding on the parties and they must comply with them and the EU expects their full, immediate and effective implementation’. I think it cannot get any clearer than that. Now let’s look at those orders – but let’s say one of them, just for illustration. There was this order that was already mentioned by some of the Members: ‘Order to Israel to take immediate and effective measures’ – immediate and effective measures – ‘to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to address the adverse conditions of life faced by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip’. End of quote. Well, if anything, now, today, one month later, these adverse conditions of life are even more adverse than they were at the time of these orders. Pockets of famine have appeared in Gaza. Hunger is so prevalent, and people are so desperate, that orderly distribution of humanitarian aid in northern Gaza, for instance, is no longer possible. And some of our partners already stopped the provision of food to northern Gaza. Attacks on United Nations and on humanitarian workers in general continue. There have been so far 161 UN staff killed since 7 October. There have been 378 attacks on healthcare, including 98 attacks on ambulances. These are quite unprecedented numbers. We also note the extensive denials of access for humanitarian missions into Gaza. We also note the increasing difficulties that UN humanitarian workers face in obtaining visas and other permits. Access to Gaza definitely is worse this month, February, than it was in December or January. Much fewer trucks have been getting through this month. So yes, there is an urgent need for the end to fighting, and this is what 26 Member States have called for, because this would allow for a massive surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza and throughout it. Let me recall that the last and, so far, the only humanitarian pause, was agreed back in November last year. The EU is not sitting on its hands. It is doing all it can. The EU has allocated more than EUR 200 million for humanitarian aid since 7 October, and we are now in the process of rolling out our EUR 125 million heavy humanitarian funding for this year, for Gaza and occupied Palestinian territories in general. We also continue our in-kind support. By now we have organised 40 flights of EU Humanitarian Air Bridge, bringing 1 700 tonnes of in-kind assistance for the Palestinians in Gaza. We have been all along in touch with our Israeli counterparts advocating the respect for international humanitarian law, calling for protection of civilians, calling for respect of some of the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law, like the principle of ‘proportionality’ and ‘distinction’ – distinction between combatants and civilians. We have been calling for opening of additional crossing points and so on, and so on. My next point is about UNRWA. No, we have not received any evidence supporting the allegations by Israel that UNWRA’s staff were involved in the terrible events on 7 October, and to our knowledge, none of the donors – other donors – have received any evidence. But at any rate, at any rate, as I said in my introduction, there has to be, at the end of the day, individual accountability for any violation of the principle of neutrality of UNRWA. And there must not be collective punishment. This is not the answer. Yes, UNRWA is irreplaceable. Who’s saying that? Let me tell you who is saying that. All other UN agencies, active and present in the Gaza Strip are saying that to us. The International Committee of the Red Cross is saying that to us, the entire International Red Cross and Red Crescent family is saying that to us, and so do the international non-governmental organisations who are present in the Gaza Strip in these very difficult circumstances. All of them are telling us, ‘No, we cannot possibly take over the role of UNRWA’. All of them. Now, how to go ahead? Certainly, we support the investigation that has been launched by the UN Office for Internal Oversight Services. We support the launch of the Independent Review Group, led by former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna. We will follow very closely, we will expect full transparency on the part of UNRWA, and we will act accordingly. But let me recall again our statement – the Commission statement of the 29 January – in which we stated very clearly: the EU humanitarian aid will continue unabated. Finally, in closing, I wish to repeat that we need to define credible prospects for peace in the Middle East. We must relaunch a political process for a two-state solution, and that is the only solution that can bring sustainable peace and security to the region. As I said in my introduction, a military solution does not exist. We have developed ideas to advance the objective of this two-state solution, based on the Peace Day Effort, and on the support by the EU and others for holding an international peace conference soon. Because of the work we did prior to 7 October, we are now in a good central place to take this work further. We are in close contact with our partners, including Arab states, to work together to that end, and even when one or more of the parties are not yet ready, we have to prepare. We have to prepare the substance of a peace deal. We have to elaborate not only how we would support peace, but also what could be a concrete, time-bound framework for the peace between Israel and Palestine.",-,2024-02-27,"12.

Jan Olbrycht,"Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, this debate has always showed very clearly what is going on in the European Parliament. Because of the changes in the budget, we have the very clear presentation of anti-Europeans and pro-Europeans, even the pacifists who are now becoming pro-Russians. So, I think this is quite a typical situation. But the big majority is on a very clear mainstream and very, very pro-democratic. Of course, what showed this debate and of course the whole work is that this kind of timing, because of the chantage, blackmailing, is absolutely unacceptable, because the Parliament is pushed to the wall and cannot any space of manoeuvre. So, this was absolutely unacceptable and we know very well what are the critical and negative elements of the result. But when you compare the positive and negative, I mean there are much more positive elements which now happened with the MFF. I would like to say that we know very well that the budget is not big enough, is not prepared to face the new challenges. This is very clear, it’s not flexible.

Reinhard Bütikofer,"Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, indeed, it is important to create a new regulation in order to overcome the lack of transparency and to stop the long legal battles that we’ve seen in the past. However, the two co-rapporteurs have presented their proposals as if they were just simple, clear, evident and balanced. I’m not convinced, and INTA has not been convinced. Within industry, within Commission, within the political groups in this House, there has been a broad debate about the right balance, and we should not try to hide that, and we should not, Ms Walsmann and Mr Wölken, attack the opposing arguments as just being threadbare. I agree with a lot that has been said by colleague Hübner. She’s been speaking not just for her own person or for her own group in INTA, but for INTA. In particular, the aggregate royalty provisions are not convincing to us, and the question whether the new regulation should just apply to future patents is also not satisfactorily solved.

Seán Kelly,"A Uachtaráin, Commissioner, licensing practices and standardised technologies have a significant impact on European industries and businesses. From Wi-Fi and other wireless communications, these technologies are integral to our modern economic fabric. In principle, I support enhancing transparency and negotiation pathways in standard essential patent processes and the Walsmann report. Recognising the importance of rationalising regulatory processes, fostering transparency and balancing the intellectual property ecosystem is an opportunity to facilitate innovation, growth and investment. However, as we embrace these opportunities, it is paramount to ensure that the European Union retains its competitiveness on the global stage. This is of particular importance to Ireland as an all location for innovation and enterprise. Smaller companies, crucial for driving innovation, often find themselves at a disadvantage due to a lack of knowledge and legal representation when it comes to essential patents. I believe this SEP Regulation will help level the playing field, providing more predictability, transparency and legal certainty, particularly for SMEs. The existing system can bring European businesses into litigations using the threat of market exclusion to enforce unfair licence terms. This ultimately causes consumers to bear higher product prices. When it comes down to it, EU competitiveness is a vital importance and should be a key factor when striking the balance between patent holders and users.",PPE,2024-02-27,9.

Danuta Maria Hübner,"Mr President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, I speak on SEPs as rapporteur of the opinion for the International Trade Committee. We have thoroughly examined the proposed regulation, focusing on global competition and the Union’s geopolitical, economic, trade and security-related interests. In INTA’s view, the regulation is not well balanced with respect to the role of patent owners and implementers. It also risks violating EU obligations under the WTO and affecting our strategic partnerships. The new measures may reduce innovation incentives and European companies’ revenues, opening up the space for state-sponsored Chinese firms to thrive, especially in military equipment. We need to take more time to find a better balance for the text. We should maintain the positive elements such as the FRAND determination, the transparency register and the competence centre, but they should be accompanied by rebalancing measures that are not in the proposed text, such as, for example, removal of the aggregate royalty provisions, the introduction of a dedicated stakeholder group and of a more credible timeline for implementation.

We need indeed to update our tools and systems to both safeguard and empower the European innovators. However, there is a palpable concern that this report, despite its noble aims, falls short on addressing many of our existing problems. This regulation has cruised through the Parliament surprisingly fast, overlooking certain key aspects that we want to amend. On one front, we have tried to raise awareness on the geopolitical risk. Promoting the entrance of third countries into the core of the patent systems will affect our innovation. Also, I believe that we should not overload our European Agencies with new tasks without giving them the resources and knowledge needed. It just doesn’t make sense and could actually kill the overall purpose of the file. Adding up bureaucratic layers will not help our companies.

Tiemo Wölken,"Mr President, dear colleagues, SLAPPs are strategic lawsuits against public participation. They are a form of legal harassment and abuse of the justice system. They are used against journalists, NGOs and human rights defenders by powerful individuals and organisations who try to avoid public scrutiny. This is why we need this Directive so badly, and with today’s adoption, we will, for the first time ever, have a definition of SLAPP cases to help our courts to tackle them. We will have an early-dismissal mechanism to cut lengthy proceedings, save costs, and shorten the victim’s suffering. We will give victims the possibility to get reimbursements of all costs, including the legal representation. We will be able to shield victims against third-party SLAPPs. And finally, we will have a definition of cross-border cases – and this is a crucial point, because the broad definition impacts how many cases will fall under the scope of this instrument, and therefore how many victims will profit from the SLAPP Directive. We made sure that as many victims as possible will benefit from the new rules. Dear colleagues, just last year we saw a record-breaking number of SLAPP cases – 160 cases – where journalists may have been deprived of their fundamental rights. At the same time, these 160 cases are a threat to our democracy, to the rule of law, and seriously undermine the fundamental rights to freedom of expression, information, and association.

Virginijus Sinkevičius,"Mr President, Members of the Parliament, the Commission takes note of the rules on international jurisdiction and applicable law the European Parliament proposed in its mandate for the negotiations on the proposal for a directive on protecting persons who engage in public participation from manifestly unfounded or abusive court proceedings. The Commission agrees on the importance of rules on jurisdiction and applicable law in the context of a comprehensive protection against abusive litigation in SLAPP cases. For this reason, in its recent legal studies on the Brussels Ia and Rome II Regulations, the Commission has specifically addressed these SLAPP-related matters. However, such changes should be made in the horizontal Regulations covering international jurisdiction and applicable law to avoid a fragmentation of these rules across various instruments, and they should be proposed with a careful assessment of the impact of such changes. Consequently, the Commission will continue the already-ongoing review process concerning the Brussels Ia and Rome II Regulations. It’s the firm intention of the Commission to issue application reports on both these instruments with a particular focus on SLAPP in the near future in order to facilitate the political decisions on their revision.",-,2024-02-27,7.5.

Dubravka Šuica,"Madam President, honourable Members, I want to thank you for this interesting debate. I took note of all your comments and also questions, and please be reassured that I will convey all of them to Commissioner Vălean. The debate shows that the views on the medical checks and the self-assessment are divergent. That is why in our Commission proposal we left the final decision to the Member States. Our aim was to ensure road safety, but also allow Members to find the right balance to have this measure effective and proportionate. Following this exchange today, I am pleased to note that even though there are diverging opinions on certain issues, we all share two main goals of the Commission’s proposal: to strengthen road safety and to facilitate free movement. I look forward to the vote, where I hope Parliament will support our proposal. While the file will unfortunately not be concluding during this current mandate, I am sure that the Plenary vote will send out a strong and unequivocal message to citizens that our Union is ready to work together to ensure that everyone can feel safe on our European roads.",-,2024-02-27,3.

Barry Andrews,"Madam President, already in 2024, Irish road deaths have almost exceeded the total number of deaths on the roads in 2019. The main causes are phone usage, speeding and not wearing seatbelts. The police also say that all of the success in the campaign against driving while under the influence of alcohol has been wiped out by a huge increase in driving under the influence of drugs. I have read many analyses of this sudden and tragic increase in road deaths. Nowhere have I seen it suggested that a good way to tackle this would be by increasing the number of medical tests for older drivers. That is why I strongly welcome the renewed focus on updating the directive and was strongly opposed to the measure on medical tests and the validity of licences for older people. Let’s look at penalties for speeding and mobile phone usage. Let’s look at increased police presence at speed limits and mandatory drug testing. Targeting older drivers is looking in the wrong place for the right answers.",Renew,2024-02-27,3.

Dubravka Šuica,"Madam President, honourable Members, on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Vălean, who cannot participate in this debate due to other institutional commitments, I would like to thank the TRAN Chair, Karima Delli, the shadow rapporteurs and the rest of the Committee for their quick and constructive work on our proposal to update the Driving Licence Directive. This is a historic piece of legislation, if adopted. This will be the fourth such directive since the original one adopted in 1980. Today, we are so used to the fact that we can drive across the European Union with one driving licence that it seems difficult to imagine when driving licences were not automatically recognised between Member States. Since 1980, we have gathered countless best practices, closed loopholes, implemented important reforms and adapted to a changing world. The revision again improves what we already have. It does not seek to reinvent the wheel, and I would ask you not to support amendments that could hamper the elements which would work well and are the basis of a well-established system. Amendments to the definitions and minimum-age requirements currently in force fall into this category. These are especially important for categories B and B1. I would also like to remind you that introducing the concept of demerit points to the directive is problematic, as this would likely prove to be technically challenging to implement considering there is no harmonisation of road traffic offences and penalties at the European level. Moreover, demerit points schemes, where these are used, vary significantly from one Member State to another. I would ask you to instead focus on issues on which we put attention when drafting the proposal. One concerns the accompanying driver scheme in the European Union. We are proposing that it should be open to 17-year-olds for licence categories B and C, as we wish to build on the positive results seen in the Member States that already have such a system. We now want to make the scheme mandatory. Anything less will cancel out the positive impact on road safety, and it will also diminish its contribution to tackling the current shortage of professional drivers. I want to remind you once again that the road freight sector had around 400 000 unfilled positions at the last count. I would also ask for your support for our proposal to raise the minimum standards used to ensure fitness to drive. This applies to all drivers, regardless of age. Today, Member States have no mechanism in place to ensure that category A and B licence holders are medically fit when they renew their licence 15, 30 or 45 years, or even longer, after it was issued. We want to make clear that all drivers who are fit to drive should be allowed to do so. However, holding a driving licence is not only about entitlements, it is also about responsibilities. Between 5% and 15% of all traffic accidents can be attributed to the driver’s medical fitness. I want to make reminder that the Commission chose to include in its proposal the possibility to do a self-assessment, which we still believe to be viable and proportionate on our way forward. I would urge you to support amendments that uphold our level of ambition, so that we can help citizens understand when it is safe to drive. Finally, I would like to thank you for your support on the probationary period for novice drivers, the European Union digital driving licence, the new system for the exchange of third-country driving licences and the easing of language requirements for driving licence applicants living in Member States other than their own. Each of these measures is key to ensuring that the fourth Driving Licence Directive achieves its goal: greater road safety and facilitation of free movement within the European Union. I look forward to this interesting debate and to the adoption of your report, which I am certain will help improve safety on our roads and will offer more opportunities for our citizens wanting to exercise the right to free movement.",-,2024-02-27,3.

Cristian-Silviu Buşoi,"Madam President, dear colleagues, it was a very interesting and constructive debate. Competition for global technological dominance is raging, especially for control over the fundamental technologies of the 21st century, such as artificial intelligence, 5G, semiconductors, green technologies and biotechnologies. Many of the major economies have put specific schemes in place to support their net-zero and digital industries, and we are very much incentivised and inspired by the Inflation Reduction Act, the instrument of our strategic ally, the United States of America. So this was an example that we should act as soon as possible. Therefore, our European industrial policy requires common European funding – and STEP and the Net Zero Industry Act is the right step in this direction. Of course, due to the necessary cuts in the MFF revision, some of the discussion turned into a discussion around structural funds. We need to find solutions also for the EU4Health programme and others. But do not forget that STEP is a platform that combines existing and new financial instruments to channel funding towards the development or manufacturing of strategic technologies. Parliament once again was very successful in getting the complete alignment between NZIA and STEP, covering all technologies and all supply chains, prioritising those strategic projects that will strengthen the competitiveness. And competitiveness and new industrial deal will be extremely important and topical for the near future and for the coming years. The keywords for STEP are innovative and cutting-edge technologies to power innovative technology solutions and give European Union companies the support they really need to unleash their potential while transforming the Union.",PPE,2024-02-27,2.

The legal obligations on EU Member States are very clear. The genocide conventions require states to avoid complicity, the EU common position on arms exports bans exporting arms where there’s a clear risk they’ll be used to violate international law, and the UN has warned that such transfers must cease. Yet, France dissembles, hiding behind secrecy and Israeli assurances, while Germany has increased its exports tenfold last year, 90% since 7 October. Ireland doesn’t even ask Butcher Biden what’s coming through Shannon Airport from the US on the way to the Middle East. What sort of people are ye?

Miapetra Kumpula-Natri,"Mr President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, I think this is a crucial file. It is not technical, even if it seems like that. I am not very happy with what has been the outcome of this file because I think it really endangers the future of the Europe's position as a telecom pioneer. I didn't hear a word mentioned here on the strategic autonomy. I didn't hear a word mentioning the critical infrastructure. On these days, we cannot forget critical infrastructure as telecom sector is very vital for us to see forward. So I think this is not a balanced version when we talk about the holders and licence providers. So I think hurrying here can do damage for European Union innovative R&D. Also, I think, for example, the explanation on the retroactivity, how can you say that, ‘please invest in Europe, but we are doing the retroactive legislation and we are overlooking that this would even change the existing patent agreements’? So, for me, it was very good that the chair of the JURI Committee has amended this one to find it more balanced.

Then, when you actually listen to the people there, you understand what it means to lose a brother or a father, and when you listen to Putin, really you also understand that, for him, Ukraine is just the beginning. He’s talking about the lost lands of the Baltics and in Poland. So this for him is just the beginning. Therefore, I’m very proud that we have agreed on the Ukraine Facility – EUR 50 billion – which is, I think, a huge sign of support, so that Ukraine can pay its soldiers. I’m also happy that we have an SME quota in there to ensure that the rather centralised post-Soviet war economy can be further decentralised. But it’s also clear this is just the beginning. We need to send all the weapons that we can send, including Taurus rockets. We need to ensure that our own house is cleaned up.

This is still the case. Many findings and recommendations put forward in the June 2023 European Court of Auditors opinion have been ignored. They found that persistent grand corruption and state capture posed a systemic risk for the Ukraine Facility, so they called on the Commission to develop a strategic document on how to prevent and combat grand corruption and state capture. Where is it? We are taking billions from other parts of the EU budget, and there are no provisions to ensure that the funds don’t end up with companies owned by the likes of Zelenskyy and the oligarchs close to him. The dogs in the street know that Ukraine is one of the most corrupt countries on earth, so why are basic anti-corruption standards being waived in the case of Ukraine?

Siegfried Mureşan,"Mr President, colleagues, today is a good day for the European Parliament and for the European Union.

I am confident that before the end of this term we can vote on this. So the agreement on the MFF revision is a positive one, but we should also work on correcting the mistakes which the Council made in the past. When we decide on the next MFF revision, the repayment of NextGenerationEU should not become a burden for the budget of the Union. We should make sure that the budget remains robust, capable of supporting in the future. It should not become a budget for repayment of debt, and we should also make sure that there is enough money in the budget in the future for the traditional priorities, for the new priorities and reserves for unexpected developments.

Johannes Hahn,"Mr President, Minister, honourable Members, when you vote on the revision of our long-term budget in a few moments, it will be an important occasion. You will decide on Europe’s power to act for the years to come, and I am grateful for the strong convergence of views across Parliament. Since the Commission proposed a revision eight months ago, we have been working closely together on this review, which allows us to amend the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), strengthening our Union by strengthening key policies. I would like to thank you, Members of the European Parliament, for your commitment, and in particular, thank you for the strong engagement of the co-rapporteurs, Jan Olbrycht and Margarida Marques. The revision of the MFF ceilings confirms the priorities that the Commission presented back in July, and that were strongly supported by this House. It provides around 80% of the original proposal with a balanced combination of new funds and redeployments. It is a very good result, despite, of course, some difficult choices. It shows Europe’s ambition and resolve to find common solutions to our shared priorities. Your vote for today’s package is about giving our Union the ability to act at various levels. Let me highlight the five key elements of the revision. First, the Ukraine Facility is a clear signal of our steadfast commitment to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. It provides predictable and stable financial support to cater for Ukraine’s immediate needs, recovery and modernisation on its path towards the European Union, totalling EUR 50 billion until 2027. I thank the European Parliament, and the co-rapporteurs Eider Gardiazabal Rubial and Michael Gahler in particular, for making the agreement possible. The set-up reflects the exceptional circumstances of the war, and should not constitute a blueprint for future programmes. In this context, the Commission has a formal statement on its interinstitutional prerogatives. We have sent it for inclusion in the verbatim record of this debate. It is now crucial that the facility can enter into force as quickly as possible, so that we can make the first disbursement under the exceptional bridge financing still in March. To address Ukraine’s urgent financing needs, we are working with Ukraine to ensure that everything is in place. Second, this is a shared priority, it is about managing migration and relations with our external partners. The review packed this up with an additional EUR 2 billion to support the new pact on migration and asylum. In addition, EUR 7.6 billion will help our partners in the Western Balkans, Southern Neighbourhood and beyond. Third, it is about European competitiveness. The Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform, better known as STEP, will support European leadership in critical technologies in the fields of digital and deep tech, clean tech and biotech. And I agree with some of you who have criticised the fact that not the full proposal was finally accepted, but this was the outcome of the discussions we had and this is what was achievable. But bottom line, I think a lot also in that context could be achieved. And, as it was rightly mentioned and highlighted by some of you, STEP will pull funding from 11 different programmes – amongst them cohesion policy funds, the European Defence Fund, InvestEU, Horizon Europe, the Innovation Fund, the Recovery and Resilience Funds – to both strengthen our Union’s open strategic autonomy and bolster its long-term competitiveness. For STEP to reach its full potential, Member States and managing authorities must now steer sufficient EU funds towards these cutting-edge technologies. The success of STEP will depend on our collective ambition, and I would like to extend a special thanks here to José Manuel Fernandez and Cristian Ehler. For us, it’s about strengthening our emergency response. We will increase our capacities for emergency response inside and outside the Union. That is why the Solidarity Emergency Aid Reserve will be reorganised and increased by EUR 1.5 billion. As the past year has proved, it is essential to be able to respond to unforeseen circumstances. We thus also increase the flexibility instrument by EUR 2 billion. And finally fifth, providing a structural solution to the increases in interest costs, as repeatedly requested by the European Parliament, a new mechanism, over and above the MFF ceilings, will offer a structural solution to the increase in interest costs of the EU’s recovery fund, NextGenerationEU. This was all achieved within the EU budget framework, preserving the unity of the budget, and the role of the budgetary authority and the prerogative of the institutions. This is a good result for the European Union as a whole and thus for cities, companies and regions. I count on your support for the revision of the Multiannual Framework, the Ukraine Facility, and the creation of STEP. Building on your hopefully strong vote today, we will translate the political agreement into action and this as soon as possible. We will present a draft amending budget for 2024 and necessary legislative adjustments to implement the revision still this week. This will feed the agreed additional funds concretely into our running budget and actual programmes. I hope that the European Parliament and the Council can deliberate swiftly on these proposals in this sense. We look forward to further working with you on strengthening our Union. And thank you very much again for this extremely valuable decision today. Commission statement (in writing) The Commission recalls that, under Article 17 TEU and Article 317 TFEU, the implementation of the budget remains its own responsibility and is part of its institutional prerogatives under the Treaties. It considers that the decisions related to payments to Ukraine under the Ukraine Facility belong to such budget implementation. The Commission regrets that the text agreed by the co-legislator provides for Council implementing decisions under Article 291 TFEU for the adoption of these measures. It considers that the solution agreed by the co-legislator could be exceptionally justified in light of the very specific circumstances of the Ukraine Facility – a medium-term single instrument of high geopolitical importance adapted to the uncertainty and unprecedented challenge of supporting a country at war with direct implications for the security of the Union. This solution should not be considered as a precedent for any other Union spending programme.",-,2024-02-27,2.

As the Chair of Industry, Research and Energy Committee, I would like to give thanks to all colleagues that contributed to this, and especially to the rapporteur of the ITRE Committee, whom I replace now, Mr Christian Ehler. It was paramount to simultaneously negotiate and conclude the MFF package STEP with the Net Zero Industry Act. With linking STEP and NZIA, we demonstrate to our industries and financial markets that they receive full political support and a legislative framework to invest and become more competitive while transforming the European Union. STEP aims to reinforce, leverage and steer all EU funds, existing and new, towards – we hope – investments in digital and deep innovation technologies, clean and resource-efficient technologies and biotechnologies within the EU, and in the individuals capable of integrating these technologies into the economy. The EU will be now able to fund, more specifically, the construction of a factory of certain technologies in Europe to increase strategic independence and competitiveness for European industry. The final agreement adds additional funds to the budget of the European Defence Fund, but largely relies on providing additional flexibility to existing funds and cumulative funding. Additional flexibility should be mobilised for STEP projects under the regional and cohesion funds ERDF, ESF+; through the NGO funds, mainly RRF, InvestEU and Just Transition Fund; cumulative funding under EU instruments for individual projects, including for strategic projects under Net Zero Industry Act and Critical Raw Materials Act. STEP touches upon a variety of existing programmes and funds. It provides for synergies and complementarities between the Innovation Fund, Horizon, RRF, InvestEU and Cohesion Fund. Dear colleagues, the Parliament was very successful in obtaining a complete alignment between Net Zero Industry Act and STEP. All technologies are covered, all supply chains covered. Strategic projects get prioritised access to the individual funds under STEP, including the Innovation Fund. We have clarified some provisions of the European Innovation Council under Horizon, and we made the whole process clearer with a better governance structure. The governance of the STEP was improved by adding a new article on the implementation of the Platform, as insisted the Parliament. Parliament’s call for additional visibility for cohesion projects was accepted by displaying examples of cohesion projects dedicated to STEP’s objectives on the Sovereignty Portal. A two-stage reporting system was created, including an interim and final report. The role of the interim report was strengthened, and its main purpose will be to evaluate the contribution of the Platform to its objectives in time to feed into the decision making of MFF post-2027. So, we managed to deliver for Ukraine, to give a strong and not only political signal but concrete support for Ukraine. But also we managed to give the right signal to our industries, to our economies, to our financial markets, to invest smart in the future, to support the new technologies, the clean technologies, to invest in digitalisation and biotechnologies, and make Europe more resilient and more competitive worldwide.",PPE,2024-02-27,2.

Michael Gahler,"Mr President, dear colleagues, the European Union delivers on its promises on Ukraine. The EUR 50 billion Ukraine Facility is a clear marker for that. And when I was in Kyiv over the weekend, like many colleagues and other dignitaries from Europe and the world, amongst the tense discussions that we had on deliveries of arms, this was a positive highlight when you mention, yes, we are delivering, although with the two months delay because of the Hungarian veto in December. Now we have enabled the Commission also to pay out the first EUR 4.5 billion, probably at the beginning of March, and thank you for that. The objective thereof is, of course, during the war, to give the larger part for budget support for Ukraine in order to keep the state running and the functions going. But it is one process. It is budget support, but it is not only preparation, but also about reconstruction ongoing. It’s about future investments and to deliver the expertise that we need for the process that will automatically be part also of the pre-accession process because we cannot separate it artificially. And for that we have, as a Parliament particularly, insisted that in this process, where a European Ukraine is created for the time after the war, that the Verkhovna Rada – our colleagues – will have a bigger say in the process, how the means are used, that other levels of administration on the region and the local level, that they would have a say and an impact on the reconstruction of the country. That it is a principle that we would build back better for future Ukraine and that that all happens in a transparent process because we are aware that the bad guys that in the past were corrupt and, fortunately, because of the transparency that is already there, corruption cases come out in Ukraine, also during the war, which is a positive development. And insofar, I am confident that with the measures that we as a Parliament have particularly put focus on, this whole process, the Ukraine plan that will be implemented by the Ukrainian government, will contribute to this better Ukraine for the time thereafter. Liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen! Wir können uns die Diskussion über die 50 Milliarden Euro aber sparen, wenn wir nicht endlich auch erkennen, dass wir die Bremse lösen müssen und die Ukraine mit dem an Waffen beliefern, was sie jetzt am dringlichsten braucht. Und das geschieht nicht. In Kyjiw war von einem „slow yes“ die Rede bei den Lieferungen, die sie über die Jahre bekommen haben. Die Prioritäten, das ist Munition, das ist Luftabwehr, und das sind die weitreichenden Raketen, um die Versorgungswege des Aggressors zu unterbrechen. In diesem Zusammenhang ist jede Debatte, die in die richtige Richtung führt, richtig und wichtig. Wir müssen endlich dafür sorgen, dass in der Europäischen Union produzierte Waffen nicht an Drittstaaten geliefert werden, sondern umgeleitet werden in die Ukraine. Wir müssen dafür sorgen, dass die 5 Milliarden Euro, die für dieses Jahr für die Friedensfazilität vorgesehen sind – wo Herr Borrell sich darum bemüht –, dass diese 5 Milliarden Euro auch für Ankäufe auf dem globalen Markt genutzt werden, damit schnell geliefert werden kann. Der tschechische Präsident hatte sich in dieser Richtung auch in München schon geäußert. Das sind alles Voraussetzungen dafür, dass die anderen Dinge geschehen können. Wenn sich dann der deutsche Bundeskanzler hinstellt und behauptet, er würde deutsche Soldaten nicht in die Ukraine schicken, weil Taurus installiert werden müsste durch Soldaten, dann ist das objektiv falsch und eine Schande, wenn man sich das anschaut, denn kein Taurus ist bisher von deutschen Soldaten im Ausland installiert worden. Da kommt die Firma aus Schrobenhausen mit ihren zivilen Mitarbeitern und tut das. Deswegen sollten falsche deutsche Debatten nicht auf der europäischen Ebene für Irritationen sorgen.

Henna Virkkunen,"Mr President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, for Europe to stay competitive we need to do more to encourage innovation. This requires continued investment in research, development and innovation. When talking about innovation, the importance of patents needs to be recognised. Therefore, it is important to maintain a balance between the interests of patent holders and the users of standards. Reducing patent protection will increase risks as it will discourage European companies from participating in the development of global standards by undermining patent protection. I have to say that this proposed regulation can have a negative impact on Europe’s competitiveness, especially in the development of 5G and 6G technologies, where standard essential patents play a crucial role. We know that 5G and 6G technologies are extremely important to the EU in developing its strategic autonomy and its global competitive edge in digital technologies. If Europe wants to keep its innovative edge we need to have stable and meaningful intellectual property rights such as patent rights. I have to say that this proposed compromise does not take into account patent protection and creates too much regulatory burden, especially to the standard essential patent holders.",PPE,2024-02-27,9.

Johannes Hahn,"Madam President, thank you for this debate, and once again, thank you for this strong support concerning Ukraine. I think we all together can be proud about what will be voted very soon. Why? Because when the Commission proposed eight months ago, in June last year, this Ukraine support package of EUR 50 billion, there was immediately a very positive reaction by Member States and the majority of this House. There was no debate that Ukraine needs the money. Why? Because Ukraine is fighting also for us and it’s about defending our rule-based world order. It’s about their territorial sovereignty. And if we don’t stop, so to say, this thinking that one can invade and can use his power to violate the territorial integrity of a country, then Ukraine is now and others might be the next ones. And this is why it is so important to support them. And by the way, there was never an issue that Ukraine does not need the money, quite the opposite: urgently. There is an urgent need to get the money, because what we are contributing monthly is around one third of the monthly cost of the state to keep the state up and running and to provide the necessary financial means. And I think we can also be proud because there will be an overwhelming majority in this House. You are not forced to desperately search for each vote like it is the case in the House of Representatives in the US. Twenty-six Member States have immediately reacted positively and the last one followed. So we can be satisfied, in a way, that at the end of the day, there was a unanimous decision in the Council and there will be an overwhelming decision here in the House. And this is an expression of how Europe stands at the side of Ukraine. And it’s also important as a signal to other partners, allies, in the world – not only to the US but also to Japan, UK and others, you name it – that we are ready to provide the necessary financial means in a multiannual perspective. And this is what we have achieved and what we have done. Number two, a lot of debate has taken place today, also on STEP. I think here we also should not underestimate the achievements we have achieved during the discussions and negotiations in terms of the regulatory side. Of course, I also would have liked to get more money, fresh money, but it is always a kind of compromise. But what we have achieved – and this will pay off in the future and I am pretty sure significantly – is the, so to say, the streamlining of different programmes which are now applicable for STEP. And this will be certainly an indication how the future could look like of the next MFF: less programmes, better accessibility for final beneficiaries and at the end of the day, a faster use and absorption of available support by the European Union. And this will further contribute to more competitiveness on the European side. But of course a lot has to be done by Member States but also by the private sector. Here, more and better cooperation is needed. But I think STEP can really serve as a first step in the right direction. So once again, thank you for the debates in the past, for preparing everything for today. And I think you are ready to vote and once again, thank you in advance for the strong support here in the House to, in particular, the Ukraine facility.",-,2024-02-27,2.

Billy Kelleher,"Mr President, this proposed regulation on standard essential patents has become fairly controversial and divisive over the last few weeks. Let’s strip it back to what the objectives of such a proposal should be: one, establishing a framework that will ultimately benefit the consumer, either by lowering the cost of these technologies, increasing the availability of technologies, or simply improving the technologies; and two, fostering innovation. And we have to ask ourselves in the area of fostering innovation with regard to the EU, there are severe regulatory obstacles and EU bureaucracy, and we cannot allow this to become the international or public perception of the European Union. We need to be known as a place where innovation can thrive and deliver on these commitments. Is it against this backdrop that we need to assess the set proposal? Does it strike the right balance between consumer interests and industrial interests? Will it foster innovation? Will it ease the process of establishing a patent or licensing a patent? I would encourage my colleagues not to get entrenched in the position of one company or another, but to take a step back and assess the proposal on the basis of what is in the best interests of the EU market.",Renew,2024-02-27,9.

David Lega,"Mr President, Commissioner and Mr Borrell, I do hope for your swift recovery and I want to address you online since you’re not here – because today I wanted to talk to you about trust. Because without trust, there can be no ceasefire and no lasting peace. Yesterday in Geneva, I met the mother of a young Israeli man murdered by Hamas on 7 October, a young man whose corpse was then taken hostage to Gaza by an UNWRA employee in an UNRWA car. This isn’t just her mother’s story. It’s all on video. I saw it yesterday, and I will never forget it. When it comes to UNRWA, how could the EU even consider business as usual? You, Mr Borrell, criticised President von der Leyen for visiting Israel after the attacks. You’ve said you fully trust your own leadership to get to the bottom of alleged UNRWA complicity in Hamas terrorism, and you’ve said that major donors who have suspended funds to UNRWA, including my own country, Sweden, have fallen prey to emotions. What will it take for you to understand that your trust is frankly irrelevant if UNRWA loses the trust of parties involved, and that whether you like it or not, donor countries are parties involved and so is Israel? UNRWA’s failed to keep the trust of all its partners, and no organisation is irreplaceable. EU aid to Gaza can and must go to more responsible, more neutral, more trusted partners who have shown their capacity by serving millions elsewhere. And honestly, Palestinians in Gaza deserve better.

Mairead McGuinness,"Mr President, good afternoon, colleagues, and can I just pay a tribute to Paolo De Castro – whose eye I cannot catch, but there you are – for his work on this file and indeed all of those who contributed to it. Given that we do have farmers’ protests across Europe, I think this is a very good news story and sends a very strong signal, because our system of geographical indications helps to promote and protect the unique qualities of the food and drink that our farmers produce here in the European Union, and those are qualities of authenticity, of taste, heritage and diversity. It’s also worth reflecting on why the Commission came forward with this proposal. We had three main goals in mind. Number one, to protect intellectual property rights in the European Union, so that our farmers and producers are fairly rewarded for their efforts. Number two, to increase the uptake of GIs across the EU – because there are large differences today between Member States and if we address this imbalance, we can help rural and regional economies across the EU. And third, we want to harmonise and simplify the legal framework, a process started by the CMO reform. So, at the end of October, we welcomed the political agreement on this new legislation. I believe the agreement reached is a balanced compromise which takes into account the sensitivities of all involved. The new legislation will create a simpler GI framework by introducing a single registration procedure for agricultural products, wines and spirit drinks. This will help to make the process more attractive for producers and more straightforward for administrations, both inside and outside the EU. Producer groups are empowered and we introduce the concept of recognised producer groups on a voluntary basis. I welcome these additions, which will help farmers to reinforce their position in the value chain and again, this is important, as we see our farmers raising concerns not just in Brussels but in all our Member States. Equally, we are giving producers stronger tools to defend their interests, with rules on the use of a GI as an ingredient in a processed product and by strengthening the protection of GIs in the online environment. This is very welcome. So I want to thank the Parliament for its support throughout the process. This work allowed us to find common ground and to meet the objectives we set. I look forward to your vote tomorrow and hope that you can endorse the final text, and that will allow us to put the law into practice in as little time as a month, and it will let our producers benefit from the new provisions as soon as possible.

But even if they were, punishing innocent people cannot possibly be just. Thousands of children killed, maimed, traumatised – how can that be just and proportional?

Barry Andrews,"Mr President, Commissioner and colleagues, I want to talk today about evidence. There is sadly widespread evidence of starvation in Gaza, and especially in the north and especially among children. There is evidence of deliberate obstacles being put in the way of the delivery of humanitarian aid by the Israeli authorities, described yesterday by the UN rapporteur on the right to food as a war crime. By contrast, according to Sigrid Kaag, in her presentation to the Foreign Affairs Council, here in the EU, there is no evidence whatsoever to back up the claim by Israel that 12 UNRWA staff took part in the horrors of 7 October. Equally, there is no evidence to support Israel’s claim that 10 % of UNRWA’s staff have links to Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad. EU Member States have ignored this paradox and the ECJ has directed that immediate and effective efforts be made to deliver aid. Since that judgement was delivered, aid has fallen by half. So I implore Member States to make decisions not based on punitive political considerations, but on evidence.

Jordi Solé,"Mr President, almost 150 days of war in Gaza. Almost 30 000 people killed – mostly innocent civilians. How many more lives need to be destroyed until this bloodshed finally ends? I say it again: the atrocities committed by Hamas do not justify the massacre of civilians in Gaza, nor the collective punishment to which, as a matter of fact, its population is being subjected. And things can only get worse if Israel carries out the ground invasion operation in Rafah, where a million Palestinians are crammed with nowhere else to go. Let us listen to the ICJ. The risk of genocide is plausible if these large-scale operations do not stop, and if access to humanitarian aid continues to be hindered. The provision of measures ordered by the court are binding. However, the reality is that in February, compared to January, humanitarian aid into Gaza has been reduced to a half. This is just shameful. Speaking of aid, to all those governments who have decided to suspend funding to UNRWA, I asked them: what exactly is the viable alternative to immediately replace on UNRWA’s operational capacity? They know the answer as well as I do: none. So what sense does this decision make? Let all the necessary controls be carried out. Let all the necessary measures be taken. But don’t asphyxiate UNRWA, because this will have immediate and further tremendous consequences on the population. This tragedy must end now.

Evin Incir,"Mr President, colleagues, as long as the bombs are falling down on Gaza, of course we need to continue debating it. Even if it is ten, 20, 30, 40, 50 times, the debate needs to continue – and, more than debate, actions must be put on the table. Because I am, to be honest, furious about the lack of action from the side of the European Union! Time is running out and innocent Palestinians are losing their lives – 30 000 people! It is not just a number, but real individuals of flesh and blood. Yes, Israel has the right to protect itself against the terrorist activities of Hamas. However, taking the lives of innocent individuals is not a form of self-defence. More than 70 % of the victims are children and women. Do we in this Parliament and the EU truly believe in upholding humanitarian principles and international law? Or do we only advocate for their application when it suits our agenda, or when the victims are deemed to be the right ones? At this moment in Gaza, newborn babies are being punished simply for being Palestinian. They don’t even have the chance to open their eyes before they are tragically deprived their lives by the Israeli bombings. Our true humanity is being tested right now. If you want to examine your own humanity, especially on the conservative side of the spectrum here, consider reversing their roles and imagine how you would respond if Palestine were the aggressors and 30 000 innocent Israelis were the victims. I consistently advocate for Israeli safety and security every day during the whole year. I also always stand up for the safety and security for the Palestinians. It is unfortunate that not all colleagues in this Parliament are capable to do the same. Colleagues, as ordered by the International Court of Justice, we in the S&D Group urge Israel to refrain from acts under the Genocide Convention, and to prevent and punish direct and public incitement to genocide. We are also grateful for the incredible work UNWRA is doing through ensuring humanitarian aid to civilians. The EU and our Member States must continue supporting UNWRA.

Janez Lenarčič,"Mr President, honourable Members of the Parliament, for more than four months, I have been calling the attention to the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza, where around 30 000 people have been killed and more than 1 million are displaced in Rafah. A recent health report from Johns Hopkins and the University of London predicts that more than 60 000 civilians will die unless there is a ceasefire and a massive surge in aid very soon. After almost five months of war and destruction, our focus must be on achieving an agreement for an immediate end to fighting to alleviate the humanitarian catastrophe, save lives and free the remaining 130 hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza. Twenty-six of our Member States share that call. In unison with most of the international community, we have urged Israel not to advance on Rafah. It would have humanitarian consequences of incredible proportions. Over 1 million Palestinians that have been displaced there and have nowhere else to go. Under these circumstances, the work of the United Nations, including UNRWA, remains crucial. UN Secretary-General Guterres and Commissioner General Lazzarini are taking the Israeli allegations against UNRWA’s staff very seriously and have taken immediate, decisive measures. We must recognise the high-risk environment UNRWA operates in, and cannot resort to collective punishment or contribute to the further humanitarian collapse in Gaza, considering UNRWA’s literally vital role for the people in Gaza. But UNRWA is also essential for the stability in the region – Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and in the West Bank – in line with EU values. And while we are working constructively with UNRWA on the reinforcement of their internal controls, an audit carried by EU-appointed experts and the vetting system for their staff, it remains of crucial importance to provide UNRWA with adequate funding. A funding gap would have catastrophic consequences. We have to be clear: there is simply no substitute for UNRWA, now and for the day after. Individual accountability must be ensured, but collective punishment cannot be the answer. The situation in the West Bank and East Jerusalem is equally concerning; demolitions, settlement construction, restrictions on movement and access, as well as settler violence have all surged since 7 October. On the adoption of sanctions on violent Israeli settlers, we have an agreement at 26. But as you know, we need unanimity to adopt EU restrictive measures similar to those imposed by the United States months ago. Some Member States have introduced national entry bans. We will continue to work towards a coordinated approach on this issue. With Ramadan approaching in two weeks’ time, there is an acute risk that the situation could get further out of hand in the West Bank and in the region if we do not act decisively. For months, we have been urging Hamas to release the hostages and for Israel to protect civilians, increase humanitarian access, seriously confront settler violence, release essential revenues with help from the Palestinian Authority and desist from actions that risk aggravating an already explosive situation. We have also urged both Hezbollah and Israel to contain the dangerously spiralling violence across the Israeli-Lebanese border. There has been no substantial progress. Meanwhile, the current escalation has been a political windfall for extremists across the region who thrive on polarisation and misery. All Iranian backed militias are active from Yemen to Lebanon. I am worried about possible miscalculations that would trigger a wider conflict. All diplomatic channels must be used to prevent further escalation, be it in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq or the Red Sea, where freedom of navigation is threatened by Houthi attacks on commercial vessels. The EU is playing its role by deploying a naval operation called Aspides to escort and defend commercial vessels. It is the seventh EU operation that High Representative / Vice President has launched during his mandate and it is a new illustration of the importance for the EU to develop its military capacities. But we must move beyond treating symptoms to treating the cause. Israelis, Palestinians and all peoples of the region deserve to live in security, dignity and a stable neighbourhood. But we all know that there is only one viable and sustainable way to achieve all these objectives: a safe and secure Palestinian State next to a safe and secure State of Israel.",-,2024-02-27,"12.

Wopke Hoekstra,"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, honourable Members, as I’m sure you are aware, I’m replacing Commissioner Wojciechowski for this important debate here with you today. Ladies and gentlemen, there is no denying that recent crises have seriously affected food prices for our consumers. At the same time, we know that serious work lies ahead of us to deal with structural challenges in our food supply. And let me start with the impact of the recent crisis. Annual food inflation in the euro area peaked at 19.6 % in March 2023, and both processed and unprocessed food were affected. And we all know how important food is in the consumption basket of our households. And this is especially serious in countries where food represents a higher share of overall household consumption, notably in parts of central and eastern Europe. And it is serious throughout Europe for low income households, which were most affected by inflated energy prices as well. Ladies and gentlemen, the major drivers of food price inflation were the prices of key farming inputs like energy and fertilisers, especially following the horrible Russian invasion of Ukraine. In addition, wages in both food manufacturing and distribution have picked up in the last couple of years. However, since March 2023, food inflation is steadily slowing down across the European Union. Energy and fertiliser prices did go down after October 2022. Last month, food inflation stood at 4.8 % in the euro area and we’re seeing the first signs of food deflation since last summer. And this has had an impact on household income too: real gross disposable household income started to increase again in 2023. And let me be crystal clear, we should stay very vigilant against any renewed pressure on our food prices. This is, if you will, in a nutshell, the current situation. But we should draw lessons for the work we have ahead of us. In March 2022, the Commission adopted a dedicated communication on food security and we suggested measures like improved flexibility of the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived to boost food banks. Our REPowerEU package included many measures to tackle energy poverty in particular, and the Commission welcomes moves in several Member States to reduce VAT on essential foods, which the Union made possible since April 2022. And we also welcome food vouchers or other support, particularly for the most vulnerable. At the same time, we must ensure that Member States’ actions against inflation, including price caps, do not have unintended consequences on our single market. The Commission continues to monitor markets and works with national competition authorities to investigate any anti-competitive behaviour that may actually inflate food prices. During the past year, several national competition authorities have launched investigations into pricing in the food chain. Looking ahead, the transition into sustainable food systems is a shared responsibility and let me stress that, Mr President, a shared responsibility where we should all share the costs and the benefits. Ladies and gentlemen, let me therefore stress that it cannot be the case that farmers alone face the cost of the transition. We’ve all heard and seen the discontent from farmers on the current functioning of the agri-food supply chain. And their ask for a fair reward for their efforts is absolutely valid. It is vital that the whole agri-food supply chain, including food, drink, retail, and even packaging and logistics, control their costs and ensure a fair sustainable price for all actors in the chain. The Commission is therefore looking into possible actions to improve the position of farmers in the supply chain and their fair remuneration. And we need to do so in a way that sustainable food remains affordable for all of our consumers because we will only have a resilient food system if commercial relationships are fair, with fair margins for all. Mr President, the strategic dialogue launched by the President of the Commission will help in understanding exactly these challenges. And we stand ready to listen to the concerns of farmers and other stakeholders, I want to remain in dialogue with the whole of our society. My offer on behalf of my colleague is that the Commission stands ready to engage in the debate and hear the suggestions of the esteemed Members of your Parliament on how to master it, and I look forward to this debate.

Luke Ming Flanagan,"Mr President, for me, the most important part of this title of this debate is the root causes. What are the root causes of price inflation? For me, it is globalised food supply chains. In a globalised world, depending on goods from faraway producers, it does not give stability of supply and therefore it does not give price stability. We in the European Union promote this policy – you do – with your mantra of free trade pitting farmer against farmer on the opposite sides of the globe. The only winners are the multinationals manipulating the price to the detriment of the consumer. And secondly, deliberately shifting production to where it can be produced cheaply leaves countries open to price shocks when an external event happens. If the Russian invasion of Ukraine had happened two decades ago, it would not have had much of a negative effect on the world market. We allowed the dependence on imported grain to grow and exposed ourselves to volition in price. We should aim for food sovereignty, where countries feed themselves. In the long term, this is the only solution. So if you’re looking for the root cause, you’re the root cause – your policies.",The Left,2024-02-26,18.

Mick Wallace,"Mr President, there are some positive things in this agreement that should increase transparency in political advertising. However, profiling will still be allowed. There will be a ban on profiling from sensitive data, but the targeting of political messages based on the individual preferences, weaknesses, situation and personality of every user will remain legal. Let’s not forget that Cambridge Analytica analysed exactly this non-sensitive data – users’ personalities, not their political opinions. Essentially, therefore, the agreement still permits surveillance advertising. God forbid that we might actually challenge surveillance capitalism and put the interests of democracy before those of Big Tech.

But if this business model is only functioning with the lowest wage and without social and labour rights, just on the basis of bogus self-employed, this model has no place in a social market economy. This is, for me, very clear. If new technologies, as algorithms, are just used to undermine social rights, basic social rights, this means that the technology of the 21st century brings us back in terms of social conditions, of labour conditions, to the 19th century. This is not progress. By the way, the argument of flexibility is always advanced, and I just want to know: can a platform work with normal working conditions, recognising the rights? And the proof is there – yes, they can, but there has to be a different way of distribution of income. So there is the good example of platforms working on the basis of fair wages and of social protection. So there’s no argument to say, well, if it’s not this model, there is no flexibility and the platform cannot work. The point is that those who are working on the basis of bogus self-employed, they are, by the way, also committing unfair competition towards those who are respecting the rules. And that’s why also it’s so important to have common standards. I am really surprised that it’s now about protecting the platforms and not protecting the most precarious workers in our economy, in our society. Really, where is Europe? It’s not about Europe, by the way. It’s not about Europe. It’s about a few Member States who should really get this message because Europe has done its job. So now we have to work together to avoid that the absence of a qualified majority in the Council becomes a missed opportunity for improving labour rights and preparing labour markets for the challenges of the future. And this debate gives me hope that an agreement on the directive is still within reach, because that’s also, in some way, some democratic attitude which should now prevail. The Belgian Presidency is committed, and I again express my full support and also my recognition for the efforts deployed by the Belgian Presidency, and particular Vice Prime Minister Dermagne and his team, to achieve this goal. The Commission remains fully committed to doing its part to reach a deal that has the support on both sides, and we count on the Parliament’s continued support to bring this important file over the finishing line before the election.",-,2024-02-26,17.

Nicolas Schmit,"Mr President, honourable Members, dear representative of the Presidency, when this Commission took office in 2019, it committed to improve the labour conditions of people working through digital labour platforms. At the end of 2020, Member States in the EPSCO Council agreed on the need to address the deteriorating working conditions of platform workers, while at the same time preserving the EU’s innovation and global competitiveness potential. More than two years ago, the Commission delivered an ambitious proposal to do exactly that: combating the misclassification of the employment status through robust legal presumption of employment, and establishing rules to ensure fairness, transparency and accountability in the automated systems used by digital labour platforms – the first comprehensive rules for algorithmic management at work worldwide. These elements would improve the level playing field for digital labour platforms in the internal market. It is an important directive not only for the platform economy, but also for the labour market of today and of tomorrow. The Parliament and the Belgian Presidency negotiators reached a provisional agreement on this directive at the trilogue on 8 February, after already a first agreement, which had been found – as the Presidency has said – by the Spanish Presidency, but which could not be approved by a qualified majority in the Council. The provisional agreement requires Member States to introduce an effective, rebuttable presumption of employment at national level, which must be in line with the following five elements. The presumption should be based on facts that indicate direction and control. The notion is to be based on national law, collective agreements or practice, with consideration to the case law of the Court of Justice. The presumption should be a procedural facilitation for people working on platforms that aim to have their employment status reclassified. National law should make it easy for the person performing platform to benefit from the presumption. The requirements under the legal presumption should not be burdensome, and the presumption should ease difficulties in providing evidence indicating the existence of an employment relationship in a situation of imbalance of power vis-à-vis the digital labour platform. The shift in the burden of proof towards the digital labour platform is clearly stipulated in the text. Therefore, the legal presumption as defined in the provisional agreement improves the situation of persons performing platform work seeking reclassification. In my view, this agreement presents an added value compared to the current situation, an obvious added value, and it does not allow digital labour platforms to easily circumvent the presumption. I consider this provisional agreement as a fair compromise, although of course I would have preferred to keep the initial Commission’s proposal with EU-level criteria in the text. At the same time, the agreed approach still contributes to more convergence due to the introduction of a legal presumption of employment in all Member States compared to the current situation characterised by high fragmentation. Therefore, the provisions contained in the provisional agreement represent an improvement for platforms operating in the EU internal market. Of course, I regret that the provisional agreement could not gather, up to now, the necessary support in Coreper despite the recent changes. Each Member State is of course entitled to its own position, but I had hoped that a compromise would have been found by now. Faced with this situation, we have no other choice but to keep on trying, and work even closer together to find a compromise that is agreeable to both co-legislators. I have full confidence in the Belgian Presidency that is continuing to explore possible solutions to find a way out of the deadlock. I just want, nevertheless, to mention there are 23 Member States who have endorsed the compromise. That means that there are four Member States who haven’t. It’s not clear those who have abstained and those who have voted against, but 23 Member States have endorsed, and we are just not very far away from a qualified majority. I am confident that the discussion planned for the EPSCO Council meeting on 11 March will provide the opportunity to find the necessary majority for an agreement. I am confident that the positive solution to overcome the stalemate will be found, as we should all share the objective of improving the working conditions of millions of people working for platforms in the EU. I also want to state very clearly that this directive was not proposed as an affront to the model of labour relations in any Member State, but as a way forward to complement existing models and improve the overall situation of platform workers across the EU. With this in mind, we are in close touch with the co-legislators and we will do everything we can to support the efforts, especially the remarkable efforts by the Presidency, to find a balanced solution, after the very open mind also which was shown by the Parliament in the negotiation. After all, this directive is about supporting the millions of people working for platforms – many young people among them – who are in need of better protection. We must not let them down, as we should not let further the Pandora’s box be opened to diminish labour rights and to generalise precariousness.",-,2024-02-26,17.

Clare Daly,"Mr President, the Council’s blocking minority on the Platform Work Directive truly is an utter disgrace, indicating corporate capture. As far as I’m concerned, we need an ethics investigation into Uber and Deliveroo and who benefited from the change in policy because, despite two agreements in trilogues – the second of which was largely watered down as a result of the influence of France, Germany, Greece and Estonia – at the end of the day, they still said no. No to basic rights for precarious workers, 28 million of whom work via digital platforms in Europe, for which this original text represented at least a glimmer of hope for a way forward. Workers like the food delivery workers in Dublin, who recently went on strike on Valentine’s Day protesting against fluctuating pay levels. These workers, often migrants, have seen their wages plummet in favour of increasingly greedy platforms as they struggle to make ends meet. While these companies may block progress, collective action such as the ones shown in Dublin will be the way forward. Solidarity will prevail.

Mick Wallace,"Mr President, it’s been over two years since we passed a progressive text here that offers protection to some of the most exploited workers of our economy, and it’s depressing to see where we are still. The number of workers in the gig economy is expected to rise to 43 million by 2025, of which 5.5 million will be labelled as being self-employed. This allows platform companies to avoid paying the minimum wage, holiday or sick pay, and social security contributions. The lobbying of platform companies such as Uber and Airbnb, both at national and EU level, has been staggering, with Uber increasing their lobbying spend by 1 400%, followed closely by Bolt and Deliveroo. This has led to a butchered and watered-down text and still no agreement. The EU once again finds itself on the side of corporations against the workers, of profit over people.

Agnes Jongerius,"Mr President, thank you Vice-Presidents, dear Commissioner, dear colleagues, I think it’s safe to say that we are all disappointed. But perhaps we can also say we’re all angry because twice we have reached this agreement, twice the Member States failed to endorse it. And I think it sets to notice that liberal and conservative voices in France, Estonia, Greece and Germany are blocking the opportunity to protect 30 million platform workers. They have caved to the lobby of Uber and Bolt, and turned their back to the workers. And from this place, I’d like to remind us all a quote from the testimony of Mark MacGann, ex-Uber lobbyist here in this House. He said ‘when tech companies have disproportionate financial resources to push their message, at the expense of the far less powerful workers upon whom their model is built – there is something truly undemocratic happening.’ And that’s happening at the moment, something truly undemocratic. Member States should accept their responsibility and make an end to this deadlock. It was President von der Leyen who promised that she would work for better protection of platform workers.

New rules that would give workers who drive us around, deliver our food or clean our homes through an app, access to basic rights, such as minimum wages, sick leave. And rules that would give workers insights in why they get a certain task or why they get paid a certain amount. And twice we managed to reach a deal with the Council presidency that does exactly this. But apparently, Macron and the German liberals find the profits of the big platforms more important than protecting precarious workers. They prefer to reward the aggressive lobby tactics on which big platforms such as Uber, Deliveroo and Bolt spent millions of euros. It’s a shame that we can’t find an agreement on a directive that would help some of the most precarious workers in Europe, a directive that could have set a precedent for the future of work and how we deal with algorithms instead of people as managers.

Věra Jourová,"Mr President, honourable Members, allow me to thank you once again for this debate and for all the work and energy the Parliament invested in this proposal. It is a key step to achieve a high standard of transparency in our elections and our politics, alongside robust, specific protections for personal data. It is also a crucial piece of legislation to tie together our world-leading data protection rules with our new digital and media market laws for this very sensitive and crucial area in this election year. Let me in the remaining time react on several contributions. First of all, on Ms Niebler and Mr Schwab, which was a very relevant point regarding proportionality. I will quote Ms Niebler that these are ‘too far-reaching’ rules. Well, I believe that even the municipal and regional elections should have the rule which will give the people, the voters, the right to know who pays the ads and who is behind the campaigns, because this is the elementary request of having full transparency. So the question is: how big the elections should be to be accompanied by transparency rules? In our view, it should apply to all elections, because in all elections, transparency and information for the citizens matter. Mr Bielan and Ms Tóth, there is absolutely no censorship embedded into this proposal. Ms Tóth, it does not ignore national interests. First and foremost, it protects the autonomous and well-informed choice of the citizens, which is absolutely important in the EU and in all the Member States, be it Belgium, France, the Czech Republic and even Hungary. Ms Grapini: yes, this regulation does not contain any measures against the dirty money. But we have other pieces of legislation, and in the national rules there is the role of the national authorities to monitor the financing of the political campaigns. I think that our regulation – which will shed light on who pays and how much, how the campaigns are being paid – will help the authorities to trace the possible dirty money which is being invested in the political campaigns. On disinformation and deep fakes: indeed, we live in the era of new risks posed to the political campaigns. We have rules in the Digital Services Act which oblige the digital platforms to pay attention to those possible risks. We need to have active civil society and media to address the disinformation in the political campaigns, because it used to be a good rule that when political actors are caught lying, they are disqualified. We are not there anymore. But at least there should be some public activity to do the necessary fact-checking of this information before the elections. As for the deepfakes, Big Tech came recently in Munich with the common commitment to label or remove deepfakes in the political campaigns. But at the same time, I have to say that I expect from the political parties the behaviour in the way or in the sense of refraining from the usage of deepfakes. And in this sense, I sent a letter to the European political parties. We also had a discussion with them, with the secretariats, and I asked them to address the national political parties. In other words, the political actors first and foremost should resist the temptation of the manipulative techniques such as deepfakes. Once again, thank you very much, and I hope tomorrow’s vote will turn out well.",-,2024-02-26,16.

Wopke Hoekstra,"Mr President, honourable Members, thank you very much also for the various remarks and the rich debate and the input you all just gave. I think the one thing we do agree on is that we need a food system that is fair, with fair rewards for literally everyone. And if you allow me, I would try to sum up my response in four quick points. First, I clearly took note of the rich contributions to the debate, and I will make sure that all the various points will be filtered back to Commissioner Wojciechowski, to President von der Leyen, and to the points Madam Jongerius made specifically on the social labour market to Commissioner Schmit. Secondly, let me reiterate once again that the President and the whole Commission takes the discussion with the farmers and with the whole sector, the whole food chain, very seriously. And that means that we are not only talking to the farmers, but also we are getting input from workers, rural communities, consumer groups, as well as from the financial sector and academia, just to make sure we get a very clear perspective. And this way the dialogue will help us to get informed and make sure that we come up with a common agricultural policy that best supports the development of an EU agriculture that is at the same time competitive, sustainable and fair to both farmers and consumers. Third, because many of these speakers ask what we can concretely do, the Commission is already working on concrete measures and will present these measures ahead of the March AGRIFISH Council, with a range of short, medium and longer-term actions, and these will be meant to improve the position of farmers in the food chain, protect them, as many stipulated, against unfair trading practices covering issues such as market transparency, governance and, if needed, improvement of unfair trading practices and other relevant legislation. And specific attention will go to measures related to margins, trading practices in the value chain and cost of production. Fourth and finally, let me once again thank the Members of this esteemed House for their input.

Mick Wallace,"Mr President, thank you very much. I’m sorry, I am nearly always here for all the debate, but something happened and I had to go. I’m sorry, but thanks for letting me in. In 2023, the IMF said rising corporate profit margins are responsible for almost half of Europe’s inflation. Big business and politicians in suits are forever telling us that spiralling wage demands are the problem. But the real problem is greedflation. Supermarket multinationals are gouging consumers. They’re also gouging farmers. Consumers have been paying crazy prices for a weekly shop and yet farmers are still being squeezed by the same retailers. And let’s not forget that the latest CAP was negotiated based on 2 % inflation. But inflation has been running at close to 10 % for the last two years – tough going for the 80 % of farmers who only get 20 % of the CAP money. Price cuts for consumers cannot come at the expense of farmers and producers. Price cuts must be funded from the margins of the supermarket chains. We have a new agri-food regulator in Ireland now, but if he hasn’t got the power to tackle greedflation for farmers and consumers, then his role won’t amount to very much.

However, the initial phase of PRIMA, started in 2017, has not been without its deficiencies. There has been a particular delay in releasing funds to applicants. In Italy, for example, who supply almost a third of the applicants to PRIMA, there have been substantial payment delays, mainly due to bureaucracy and red tape emanating from the EU side of the project.

The Commission is looking forward to tomorrow’s votes on the amendment of this very important initiative. PRIMA supports research and innovation solutions to key sustainability challenges in the entire Mediterranean region, such as water availability and sustainable agriculture.

The extension of the Partnership that you will vote tomorrow offers the opportunity to further deepen the dialogue with the Mediterranean partners. It puts forward a stable, long-term and sustainable collaboration based on mutual benefit, equal footing, co-ownership, co-decisions and also co-financing. Today’s geopolitical situation makes the cooperation under the PRIMA Framework more important than ever.

This is a very important part of the legislation what we are dealing with – because the environmental crime is the fourth biggest crime and among the most profitable ones. It is ruthless. It is not caring about people or the environment, and it is cross-border. So this is the first time we have a proper set of regulation that actually deals with those countries that have been safe havens for the perpetrators. We need a set of coherent rules and procedures in the EU. We need better police, more resources and competence on prosecution and on the courts, and last but not least, we need to set the criteria of ecocide as a part of environmental crimes.",PPE,2024-02-26,21.

Mick Wallace,"Mr President, it’s welcome that the revision of the directive will now include a provision to directly address specific, severe cases of ecosystem destruction, including habitat destruction and illegal logging. I would hope that it will make the worst polluters sit up and pay attention that they might actually be held to account for the destruction of the environment. Now, the text doesn’t actually say ‘ecocide’. Any such inclusion of this word in the operative part of the directive was blocked by the EPP, but the recitals make it clear that the intention of the directive is to criminalise cases comparable to ecocide. The next step for the EU now should be to push for the amendment of the Rome Statute of the International Court to add ecocide, as a fifth crime, to the Rome Statute.",The Left,2024-02-26,21.

Thierry Breton,"Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission very much welcomes the agreement reached by the co-legislator on this file in November last year, and I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Manders, the shadow rapporteurs and the entire European Parliament for the constructive work on this file. This directive is an ambitious instrument which will have long-lasting effect on the ground by enhancing the legal framework for effectively tackling environmental crimes. The revised directive includes a comprehensive and up-to-date list of environmental offences that will address the most serious environmental crimes, including transboundary offences. For example, breaches of environmental obligations such as illegal trade and handling of chemicals or mercury, as well as illegal ship recycling, will have to be treated as criminal offences in all EU Member States. Causing particularly serious damages to the environment will be considered as an aggravated offence, leading to higher sanctions. Moreover, the directive defines concrete types and levels of sanctions for natural and legal persons. This is an important step forward compared to the 2008 directive. Similar types and level of penalties for natural and legal persons will apply across the EU and thus enhance the deterrent effect of the text. Specific aggravating circumstances and accessory sanctions and measures will allow for a tailored response to specific crimes. And given that an environmental crime often has a cross-border nature, European coordination as well as cooperation between the competent authorities will be reinforced. Authorities will be required to develop a strategic approach to ensure a strong response to criminal behaviour. The new rules will include provisions strengthening the enforcement chain and relating to support to environmental defenders in criminal proceedings. The new Environmental Crime Directive will send a strong signal beyond the EU, of course. The Council of Europe is currently working on a new convention on the same matter. So let me conclude by once again expressing the Commission’s gratitude to the European Parliament, and in particular, to the rapporteur and his team for the work put into this proposal and the excellent collaboration. The Commission stands ready to deploy all efforts to facilitate the transposition of this new piece of legislation, to ensure it can be swiftly implemented.",-,2024-02-26,21.

Mick Wallace,"Mr President, international law is in trouble these days. The US and its allies, they seldom actually talk about the UN Charter anymore. They prefer to refer to the international rules-based order, which they make up as they go along, which makes it easier for them to actually facilitate the genocide that is taken place in Gaza. Likewise, if we look at organisations like the ICC, we had a woman from Ghana, Fatou Bensouda, and she had the audacity to threaten to investigate the US for war crimes in Afghanistan and also to investigate the possibility of Israeli war crimes in the occupied territories. So that didn’t go down very well and the US threatened her. She soon lost her job and she was replaced by Karim Khan, who is very amenable to the US interest. He recently went to Israel and he met the victims of the Hamas attack, but refused to meet the Palestinian victims. This man cannot possibly be trusted to implement justice at the ICC. It’s an absolute joke that he still has the job and he should be removed if he’s of any interest in the future of the ICC.",The Left,2024-02-26,22.

Barry Andrews,"Mr President, the attempt by the right in this hemicycle to kill the nature restoration law is shameful. We need to work together to restore nature, which is our lifeline. There’s too much at stake tomorrow and rejection cannot be an option. We cannot kick away the biodiversity pillar of the Green Deal. We have seen and witnessed the collapse of Europe’s natural systems. More than 80 % of European habitats have vulnerable status and this applies equally to Ireland. Voting in favour of nature restoration tomorrow will give us the opportunity to contribute to a truly historic and pivotal piece of legislation that will improve the lives of people for generations and generations to come. And one of the most important reasons for supporting nature restoration is economic. It seems to escape the right in this hemicycle that the economy and nature don’t compete: they complement one another. That’s why 1 400 businesses wrote a letter of support of the law and according to the EU’s own impact assessment, the costs upon which opponents exclusively focus is EUR 150 billion, whereas the benefits are likely to be EUR 1.8 trillion.",Renew,2024-02-26,22.

Luke Ming Flanagan,"Mr President, for years, I’ve supported the idea of farmers being paid to produce a basket of public goods: clean water, carbon sequestration, biodiversity regeneration. The nature restoration law was the prime opportunity to make this happen. But sadly, this law doesn’t do that. In the supermarket of public goods, under this regulation, the farmer will be met at the cash desk with a customer that has no money. The farmer will be told by the customer as they walk out of the shop, ‘Sure, we’ll tell you what these public goods are worth in 2028. Don’t worry, it’ll all work out.’ It won’t, though, because when 2028 comes, we already know that there is no money. Nothing. Would any of you work today on the promise that you might get paid in 2028? No, you wouldn’t, because you’re not stupid. So why expect others to?

Chris MacManus,"Mr President, this weekend I attended the Irish Skipper Expo, which brought together fishermen with fishing and coastal stakeholders from across Ireland. The message I kept hearing was that Dublin and Brussels are not doing enough to ensure the survival of the Irish fishing sector, which has taken real blows between Brexit and the COVID pandemic. There is a real fear that there is more to come, as the EU negotiates deals that could offer third countries even more access to our pelagic fish stocks, such as mackerel. We need the Irish Government to stand up and demand improved fishing opportunities for our fishing sector. Solutions do exist for improved fishing opportunities, such as quotas for species new to our waters, like bluefin tuna. A chairde, we are an island nation, and it is time for the Irish Government to stand up for our fishermen.",The Left,2024-02-26,22.

Věra Jourová,"Mr President, honourable Members, I am pleased to be here with you today for this debate concerning the regulation on the transparency and targeting of political advertising. And of course, first of all, I want to thank the rapporteurs, Sandro Gozi and Anna Donáth, and the shadow rapporteurs – we just heard Ms Verheyen – and all the Parliament’s team for their hard work on this file. I can confirm what we already heard from the speakers before me: that we have achieved an agreement on a complex and innovative proposal. It sounds a little bit dry. This proposal has been one of the most complex and most difficult ones, because the more we worked on it, the more we had to cope with a totally new situation, uncharted territory – something which also contained a lot of dilemmas, not having inspiration or some proposal which might serve as a good example of how to set up the rules in this regulation, so that it can work as a very strong, let’s say, younger sister of the Digital Services Act. All that was on our table. And also I remember the trilogue – that it was one of the most exciting and interesting moments for common work with the Council and with the Parliament. I believe that the outcome is both ambitious and balanced. It establishes a harmonised, high standard of transparency for all political advertising services provided in the internal market, as well as strict and effective protection of the personal data used for the targeting and ad delivery of political advertising. It clarifies the scope of application of the regulation to cover advertising sponsored by political actors and other advertising when it is liable and designed to influence the outcome of a democratic process. And what we already heard today from Sandro, who mentioned that very important for all of us was that the law must protect the freedom of speech by providing clear exceptions for political opinion expressed in a personal capacity and journalism. The internet has to remain the space for free agora and for non-barrier political and public discussion. But, as we all know, the freedom of speech is not the same as freedom to reach, and the agreement clearly bans the use of profiling based on sensitive personal data to target or deliver online political ads. It also strictly limits the use of other personal data to situations where the individual has provided it, and consented to its use for its purpose. I want to be shorter, so, finally, the deal guarantees the cross-border role that the European political parties and groups play within the Union in the European Parliamentary elections. This is now becoming very important, a few months before the elections. For the record, the Commission has a formal statement on the resourcing of the European repository for online political advertising, which colleagues will be aware of, and which is being sent to the Parliament’s services for inclusion in the verbatim record of this debate. Elections are coming. We will all agree that the elections must remain a festival of democracy; a competition of real people, ideas, visions, and not the competition of dirty digital methods and abused procedures. And Anna indicated it very well that this is one of our biggest values in the EU – that we still have a high chance of having free and fair elections – but we have to work in that direction. So once again, thank you and well done to the rapporteurs and his team, and your teams, for having worked closely with the Commission and successfully concluded the hard-fought negotiations. Commission statement (in writing) The provisional agreement resulting from interinstitutional negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council includes an obligation for the Commission to set up a European repository for online political advertising. This repository has the tasks to enable public access to online advertisements, together with the information provided by political advertising publishers via a single portal, i.e. the European repository, and to ensure that this information is stored, hosted, indexed and made available to the public through a dedicated single portal for a period of seven years. The Commission recalls that, in comparison to the initial Commission proposal (COM(2021) 730 final of 21.11.2021), this constitutes a significant development which entails a substantial financial and administrative burden for the Commission. Indeed [In particular], the provisional agreement introduces a number of tasks and obligations for the Commission which will entail a substantial increase in workload, both in the short and in the long-term i.e. beyond the current programming period. These include: - the adoption of implementing acts in areas which the Commission had not envisaged, - the development, deployment and future maintenance and upgrades of uniform and effective IT tools for this repository, including to ensure: - that political advertising publishers are able to access this mandatory service; - that the public, interested entities and competent national authorities are able to access the information provided by this Repository; and - that compliance with relevant laws is guaranteed, including during periods affecting national elections. This has a direct impact on the human resources required for the Commission services, as well as on the budget, which was not anticipated when the Commission submitted its proposal, amounting to around four to six additional FTEs at the European level and, at minimum, around EUR 1,5 million additional annual budget costs. The Commission has prepared a Legislative Financial Statement to this effect. For the current Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), tasks that are to be performed internally in the Commission will need to be addressed by reallocation and redeployment within the services, and financed through redeployments within the available financial envelope of existing programmes or prerogative budget lines, which would therefore be reduced so as to increase the EU contribution to an agency or other management body entrusted with the management of the Repository. Funding after 2027 cannot be prejudged and will depend on the outcome of the preparations and negotiations of the MFF post-2027. In parallel, the Commission will explore possible options to entrust the responsibility for the management and operations of the European repository for political advertisements to an agency or management body, which is a flexibility that is provided for in the provisional agreement.   Angelika Niebler, Verfasserin der Stellungnahme des mitberatenden Rechtsausschusses. – Herr Präsident, Frau Kommissarin, liebe Kolleginnen, liebe Kollegen! Meinungsmache im Internet, manipulative Botschaften, Fake News und Social Bots – der Einsatz von künstlicher Intelligenz kann in der Tat Wahlen und Abstimmungen beeinflussen. Wir haben das ja im Fall von Cambridge Analytica erleben müssen. Mit der Verordnung über die Transparenz und das Targeting politischer Werbung sollen solche Wahlmanipulationen künftig unterbunden werden – gut so! Aber ich denke, die Regeln sollten so ausgestattet werden, dass wir künftig auch noch für unsere Meinung als politische Parteien werben können, dass Wahlkampf stattfinden kann. Da sind wir – denke ich mir – vor allem in einem Punkt etwas übers Ziel hinausgeschossen: Die Regeln gelten nämlich nicht nur für die Europawahlen, für die – bei uns in Deutschland –Bundestagswahlen, für die Landtagswahlen, sondern sie gelten auch bei der Kommunalwahl. Kommunalwahlen beispielsweise in einer kleinen Gemeinde mit ein paar Hundert Bürgerinnen und Bürgern werden künftig gleichgesetzt beispielsweise mit den Europawahlen, an denen 440 Millionen Menschen teilnehmen. Ich denke, das geht einfach zu weit. Ich denke, wir sollten gerade unsere kommunale Ebene – da haben wir sehr viele ehrenamtlich Tätige – nicht diesen strengen Regeln unterwerfen. Die Werbung gilt ja hier mit Blick auf Transparenz auch nicht nur für Social Media, sondern eben auch für alle Formen der Offlinewerbung. Auch da, finde ich, sind wir etwas übers Ziel hinausgeschossen. Warum muss ich bei jedem künftigen Kugelschreiber, den ich verteile, hier eine Fülle von Transparenzvorschriften beachten? Ich denke, das geht einfach ein bisschen zu weit, und deshalb habe ich mit dem Teil des Vorschlags auch meine Probleme.",-,2024-02-26,16.

Christine Lagarde,"Mr President, thank you, and thank you very much, honourable Members of the European Parliament for your very diverse and many questions on different topics. So let me start first with one that is very, very clear to me, as is clear for all of you, I am sure, which is that the primary objective of the European Central Bank is price stability. It is inscribed in the Treaty, Article 127. There is no doubt, no question about it – this is the objective and it is the primary one. Which doesn’t mean to say that there are no secondary objectives which are also inscribed in the Treaty, but they are inscribed as such: without prejudice to the primary objective. So I think, be under no doubt that this is very clear in my mind and in the mind of members of the Executive Board – all of them – as well as members of the Governing Council. One of you asked: ‘What are the tools?’ Well, what are the tools for what? To achieve price stability. And price stability has been defined as 2 % medium term – very clear. And this is what we are aiming for, this is where we will get. For that, of course we need to tame this inflation that is vastly unequally hitting our citizens. The higher the inflation, the more the least privileged are hurt. And the service that we can do to the less privileged is precisely to fight inflation, to bring it down to that 2 % medium-term objective that we have. So, what tools do we have? The primary tools that we can use are the interest rates. Where we are in the cycle, and given the magnitude of the force of inflation, this is the best tool that we have available and we have been using it. I remind you that we went from -0.5 % to 4 % – just looking at the DFR, the deposit facility rate. In addition, but somehow on the back burner, we have also – and this has been mentioned by one of you – gradually started reducing the size of our balance sheet and the footprint that we have on the markets. This has happened for two reasons: one, the reimbursement of the TLTRO programmes that we had to put in place to respond to the COVID crisis. EUR 1.7 trillion has been reimbursed in the course of the last few months. There is still a little bit left and there will be yet another reimbursement of a significant amount in March, but we are getting to the end of that. We are also reducing, of course, any kind of reinvestment in the APP – so the asset purchase programme is on a run-off mode, and there is a declining footprint as a result of that. And it has been decided that on the pandemic emergency programme, we will continue to reinvest, but reducing our reinvestment by EUR 7.5 billion as of 1 July. So this is happening at the same time as we are using our major tool, which is interest rates. This is very clear to me. Second point – because it has been raised by some and it is always an object of questions – on wages. So wage pressures remain high and as I said during my comments, we expect them to be a key driver of inflation dynamics in the coming quarters. But almost in the same breath of air, I said that we are also observing what we had expected, which is that profits – I am oversimplifying it – profits are not increasing at the pace that we have seen them increase in the course of 2022 and beginning of 2023. So during the second half of 2023, profits were contributors to inflation by only 25 %, whereas in the past it had been 50 %. So gradually, because of pressure on demand, we are seeing a reduction of profits because they absorb some of the wage increases. And those wage increases are a factor of two things: one, a tight labour market in many of your economies, and second, a catching-up with inflation that has been suffered by employees. So we are observing that very closely because it’s a key factor, a key driver, but we are gradually seeing that wage increase caused by the two factors that I have mentioned being actually partly absorbed by the profit contribution to inflation, which has reduced. Now, I want to finish with two things. And I want to specifically address one issue, which is that of the participation of the European Central Bank in the fight that many of you in this Chamber have decided was critically important for Europe, which is the fight against climate change and the protection of biodiversity. And let me also be very clear on that point: this is your call. It is your domain. It is your decision. And that of government’s executive and legislative arms are the drivers of that bus. But let me also be clear that to the extent that we have to evaluate the risks, to the extent that we have to conduct macroeconomic analysis, it is imperative that we take into account climate change. And to the extent that we are complying with our primary objective and delivering on our secondary objective without prejudice to the primary objective, we have to consider those issues. Does that mean that we are excluding anyone? ‘No’ is the answer, very squarely. At the European Central Bank, we value highly – and I can tell you that personally, I value immensely – diversity. And it’s not just the gender diversity that we will all celebrate on 8 March. It’s intellectual diversity. It’s diversity of background, diversity of understanding and assessment of the economic reality that we live in, based on facts, on knowledge, on science. Does that mean that we would be excluding people? No. Diversity does not call for exclusion. Diversity calls for inclusion, debate, proper understanding of each and every one’s position. So while I completely support all my colleagues, including the one that you have referred to, I realise that sometimes words can go a little bit beyond the passion that underlies what they express. But trust me, diversity will not be diluted by the passion of something that is critically important and that impacts on our activity and I will only mention assessment of risk, tilting of our corporate portfolio and taking into account in our models and in our assessment of economic reality the imperative of climate change that belongs as a priority to you and to the executive branch of our governments.",-,2024-02-26,15.

Mairead McGuinness,"Mr President, colleagues, if I can just come back to the core of this debate, which is the report on the ECB, and I think it is positive that the views of the three institutions converge on most aspects of the ECON report. And also to remark that we are celebrating 25 years of the euro this year. We have 20 countries now using the euro. Bulgaria is likely to join and is making significant progress, and we hope it will soon meet all of the criteria to become the 21st member. Joining the euro area is good for the countries that join, for the euro area and for the EU as a whole, strengthening the global role and influence of the euro, and this is essential to maintain the EU’s competitiveness. Now, many people have said we need significant investment and I will just echo that call, and it will need primarily to come from the private sector. So in this context, advancing the capital markets union and completing the banking union are urgent priorities. A resilient banking sector can strengthen confidence in our single currency. By integrating EU capital markets, CMU can also facilitate the transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy. I think we all know in this House that capital markets union is a long-term project and we have done a lot in this mandate to advance CMU, but frankly, this is not enough to improve EU competitiveness and to meet these enormous investments around competitiveness improvements, the green and the digital transitions. We welcome that the Eurogroup is working on a statement on the future of the capital markets union. It is no secret that I share the impatience of some on the slow progress on CMU and I would urge all Member States to consider the high cost to our businesses, large and small, if we fail to further develop CMU. And if we fail, we will fail to provide the necessary investment to address competitiveness, sustainability and digitalisation, and these are challenges that our economy and society face today. So, I very much look forward to the final outcome of the work of the Eurogroup and I hope that political declarations on CMU are matched by political commitment of Member States and other stakeholders during negotiations on the relevant legislative proposals. It is not always thus. Finally, as we move towards a more digital economy, we want to keep access to the euro by means of a digital euro and, together with the ECB, this is about making the euro fit for the digital age. The digital euro project is under discussion following our proposal of last June and those discussions are, I believe, going well in the ECON Committee, and we are grateful for that progress. We are expecting similar progress on strengthening the legal tender status of cash and despite some comments to the contrary in this debate, let me stress that the European Commission defends citizens’ rights to access cash and to have acceptability of cash, while also working on a complement: the digital euro.",-,2024-02-26,15.

Mairead McGuinness,"Danke Herr Präsident Karas, President Lagarde, colleagues, I’m very happy that we are discussing this draft report on the work of the ECB in 2023, and I want to particularly thank the rapporteur, Johan Van Overtveldt and members of the ECON Committee for their insightful reflections. Parliament’s assessment is an important part of the democratic accountability of the ECB, as the President has just referred to, and the Commission shares the general sentiments of the ECON report, including the report’s concerns that high inflation is a threat to macroeconomic stability. Inflation has hit our households and our companies hard, bringing economic growth to a halt for a good part of last year, so the Commission welcomes the easing of inflationary pressures over the past months. We acknowledge the ECB’s strong commitment to ensuring price stability and its decisive action. The ECB raised its main policy rate from 0.5 % in July 2022 to 4 % in September 2023, which is the steepest rate increase in the history of economic and monetary union. This strong monetary policy tightening has worked its way through the economy and ensured that high inflation did not become entrenched in households’ and firms’ expectations. In addition, this tightening has been transmitted across the euro area without severe market tensions. Now looking ahead, both the Commission and the ECB expect inflation to come down towards 2 % by 2025 and as inflation comes down, the economic growth is forecast to gradually pick up over the course of this year. The ECON report points out that expansionary fiscal policies could counteract the ECB’s monetary policy tightening, and the Commission has repeatedly stressed the need for fiscal policy to be consistent with the efforts of monetary policy to fight inflation. The fiscal stance in the Euro area turned restrictive last year: in the 2024 European Semester autumn package, the Commission recommended a continuing restrictive policy fiscal stance for this year and next, and this is consistent with the need to reduce public debt and deficits, as well as ongoing monetary policy efforts to fight high inflation. At the same time, the Commission shares the ECON report’s conclusion that fiscal efforts should be combined with investments and reforms that support growth. Fiscal adjustment should not come at the expense of public investment. I would add that investment is expected to increase in most Member States, both nationally financed investments and the continued support from the Recovery and Resilience Facility and other EU funds. This is important as it will support sustainable growth. The need to maintain debt sustainability while promoting reforms and investments was the cornerstone of the economic governance reform proposed by the Commission. I welcomed the provisional political agreement reached between Parliament and Council on the new fiscal rules. The legislative package is likely to be adopted before this Parliament’s recess, and we are now preparing to implement the new framework. This will provide predictability and credibility to the Member States’ fiscal investment and reform strategies for the years ahead. I will reserve my comments on CMU for my concluding remarks, and I look forward to listening to your contributions.",-,2024-02-26,15.

Mick Wallace,"Mr President, the publication of the European Central Bank 2023 report comes at a time when European banks are on course to return more than EUR 120 billion to shareholders off the back of their 2023 results, as they pass on the benefits of surging interest rates to investors. Today, most EU banks’ shareholder returns are larger than annual profits and this is something that the ECB and the European regulator need to act on, particularly as these surging interest rates are predominantly linked to the war in Ukraine. Unfortunately, the ECB report appears to be silent on the issue of increased buybacks flowing from massive interest hikes. The ECB has the capacity to intervene – during COVID, the ECB recommended that banks refrain from paying out dividends and buying back shares for the period. The current EU banking model that allows investors to profit off war is abhorrent. If the ECB is concerned with regulating, it should recommend that banks refrain from buying back shares while the war in Ukraine continues.",The Left,2024-02-26,15.

President,"Dear colleagues, last Saturday marked two years since Russia launched its war of aggression against independent and sovereign Ukraine: a war that no one wanted, that no one invited, that no one provoked, but one that Europe united to meet. I happened to be in Kyiv with President Zelenskyy, representing this House, when we learned that the city of Bucha had been liberated by Ukrainian forces. We saw the horror of what the Russian troops left behind: the destruction, the decay, the suffering, the slaughter of innocents, the brutal sexual violence on women and girls. This is a reality that the world has witnessed across Ukraine for the last 732 days. While the horror is as real today as it was then, the world also bore witness to the unshakeable courage of the people of Ukraine. They stood up, they defied the odds and they inspired the world. They continue to inspire us all. (Applause) And the worst of times in these last years have also brought out the best of Europe: a unity and sense of common purpose that culminated in Ukraine being granted EU candidate status; a common bond between our House and the Verkhovna Rada forged literally under fire. We have stood with Ukraine and we will remain by their side for as long as it takes to find peace – a real peace with justice, with accountability and with integrity. We are a continent built for peace. Our Union is the promise we made to a generation who only knew war and it is a promise that we must keep protecting. That is why we could not and did not hesitate to stand with Ukraine when it mattered the most; why our political, diplomatic, humanitarian, financial and military support did not waver as we welcomed millions of Ukrainian people – forced to flee from their homeland – into our homes and our hearts. So to everyone in Ukraine: we want you to know that you can continue to count on this House and our Members’ support. We know what is at stake, what the consequences of action – and inaction – are, why Europe needs to stand up for our values and our freedoms. Together we will win. Slava Ukraini! (Applause) Let us mark this moment now, dear colleagues, by watching the screen for a few moments. (A video was shown in the Chamber) Dear colleagues, this week also marks 100 days to the European elections, which will be held between 6 and 9 June. The more people that vote, the stronger European democracy becomes. I would like to remind Members of all the available resources that can help in raising awareness about the European elections. Notably, there is a special election website with a ‘remind-me-to-vote’ feature and a new version of the ‘What Europe Does for Me’ website. Together, I am confident that we can continue to show politics as a force for good and that Europe can deliver. In this spirit I also want to emphasise the importance of our legislative work. And here I want to thank you all for your steady commitment in closing off all our pending legislative work, because delivering on these files is where citizens can see the difference that Europe makes and the progress we can achieve when we work together. We need to show that this Parliament works until the last moment; I am confident that we will do that, and I am confident that people will return this House stronger. Now for a sad announcement. Dear colleagues, I regret to inform you that on 20 February our friend and colleague Erik Bergkvist sadly passed away. Erik will be remembered for his thirst for knowledge, his intellectual curiosity and profound sense of humanity. He was a man of steadfast integrity and was never one to shy away from believing and defending what he knew to be right. In this House, Erik’s commitment to our shared values marked him out. His work in helping cut down emissions and meeting our climate ambitions will serve as inspiration for legislatures to come. Erik’s spirit will live on in the lives that he touched and in the legacy that he leaves behind. Our thoughts are with his family, the Swedish delegation and the S&D Group in this House. May they find solace and peace as they navigate through this difficult time.

Irene Tinagli,"Mr President, among the many things included in the report that we will vote on tomorrow there is a reference to the opinion that the ECB gave on the Commission’s proposal on the reform of economic governance, which President Lagarde earlier also referred to. In the same opinion, the ECB says something very important, which I would like to underline today, namely – and I’m quoting – that further progress on euro-area specific aspects is needed, in particular the development of a framework to monitor and steer the aggregate euro-area fiscal stance to provide a counterpart to monetary policy and the need for a permanent central fiscal capacity. This is something we’ve been discussing many times, also in this room, in the committees, but always postponed. Now, let me say one thing: things halfway means doing them badly because usually the missing half never gets done. So this is why I hope that this Parliament can take a clear commitment on these two elements before the final vote on the governance package in April: it would be a very important signal to our citizens that we can and must give.",S&D,2024-02-26,15.

Bas Eickhout,"Mr President, Madam President Lagarde, I have the feeling we are thrown back into time if I hear some of my colleagues who are talking about economic policies. Yes, we need a lot of investment. Europe needs a lot of investment. And indeed, policies need to be aligned with that. And I think it was very good, Madam Lagarde, that you were also pointing out that Europe needs investments. And I think, if I hear the concerns on inflation, I’m very happy that you are correcting some of the parts in the report that are pretending as if inflation is still our biggest concern, because – as you rightfully say – indeed, also core inflation is going down. I think our biggest problem now is the lack of investment and indeed the lack of independence, as you say as well. But that means that we have to look at our current policies and the ECB also has to look at its current policies, and I do think we need to debate now the loosening, because we’ve heard some German hawks here who probably only want to discuss further tightening. But I do think that we have to just be having a rational debate on loosening up some of the policies and then mainly on loosening up the policies that allows for investments in renewables, for example. When you say, Madam Lagarde, that investments in renewables are so important, then we need to start talking about targeted green lending, differentiated lending rates, because that is not the issue of that is not possible right now. There are more and more policymakers speaking for that. There are, in the ECB, people talking about that, because they are knowledgeable on green issues – that apparently is also not allowed anymore, it’s interesting. But I would like to hear from you: are you willing to discuss and to propose that there will be targeted green lending and that there will be loosening for green expenditure? Because that is absolutely needed. And we know that for renewables, we need upfront investment. So stricter rental rates are disproportionately hitting investments in renewables.",Greens/EFA,2024-02-26,15.

Sven Simon,"Mr President, Madam President, Commissioners, recent media reports have quoted a senior executive board member of the ECB as stating if you are critical of greening policies, then you are not welcome to work at the European Central Bank. ‘If you’re not green, you’re not wanted’ – this was the headline. Madam President, I was at first doubtful whether this reporting could be true. But after your statement during the monetary dialogue, I grew increasingly concerned. Your answer on this incident was rather ambiguous and I have to say that you have been sometimes ambiguous in that concern in the past two years, even though I always thought we were in agreement. The European Central Bank has a mandate for price stability. That does include, indeed, taking into account climate-change-related risks for the financial sector and evaluating the implications for central bank balance sheets and their own management of risk. Undertaking an active climate policy, however, is not covered by the mandate and this would not only be illegal, but also put our currency at risk. And for that reason, I would like to kindly invite you today to take the opportunity to clearly distance yourself from this statement: ‘if you’re not green, you’re not wanted’, or further explain what was meant with that, and I am sure you can do that.",PPE,2024-02-26,15.

Billy Kelleher,"Mr President, I welcome the report and the discussions on the same. Obviously, price stability is critically important and it is your major mandate in the ECB. But I do want to put on the record the serious challenges that we have in the Irish economy with regard to lending to small and medium-sized businesses. I have raised this with your predecessor, I’ve raised it with you, I’ve raised it with the Commission. We have two pillar banks lending in Ireland and over the last number of years we have seen a steady decline in credit to small and medium-sized businesses – at a time when our economy is expanding dramatically. So there is an inherent dysfunction at the heart of the Irish banking system, whereby Irish banks make more money by depositing funds in the ECB overnight rather than lending to the real economy. So it is a significant challenge and we do need to ensure that we take measures to attract competition into the Irish economy – that ensures a capital markets union, a banking union. But we do need to see greater transparency on why we do not have proper functioning banking systems in Ireland lending to the small and medium-sized business sector.

Christine Lagarde,"Mr President, Commissioner Mairead McGuinness, honourable Members of the European Parliament, rapporteur, as we approach the end of this legislative term, I wish to sincerely thank this Parliament for collaborating in guiding Europe through economic headwinds and geopolitical upheavals, always with the shared vision of bolstering prosperity and fostering resilience. Thank you. Building on the collaborative spirit, today’s debate on your draft resolution on the ECB Annual Report is a pillar of the ongoing dialogue between the two institutions. And indeed, it is fundamental to the ECB’s accountability, which ensures the democratic legitimacy of our actions. So let me start by outlining the current state of the euro-area economy and our monetary policy stance. I will then focus briefly on the need for a common European response to strengthen euro-area resilience and competitiveness. The euro area has been facing significant headwinds from a series of sudden and consecutive shocks, which pushed inflation very high in the wake of the post-pandemic recovery. Having peaked at 10.6 % in October 2022, inflation has since declined significantly, thanks to the unwinding of energy shocks and various supply-side disruptions, along with determined policy action. After expanding by 3.4 % in 2022, euro-area economic activity has been weak in 2023, with real GDP growth having stagnated in the final quarter. Subdued demand for euro-area exports – owing mainly to weaknesses in global trade and earlier losses in competitiveness, as well as tight financing conditions – are weighing on growth. Weakness in manufacturing activity has been extending to the services sector since the end of 2023. However, there are now increasing signs of a bottoming-out and some forward-looking indicators point to a slight pick-up later this year. Despite the sluggish economy, the labour market has remained resilient. Unemployment stood at a historical low of 6.4 % in December amid robust demand for labour, which is, however, showing some signs of weakening. Inflation decreased slightly to 2.8 % in January. Energy prices declined by 6.1 %, and food inflation, while still elevated, came down further to 5.6 %, primarily reflecting a lower inflation rate for processed food. Core inflation – that you have mentioned, rapporteur – excluding energy and food price developments, also decreased further to 3.3 %, reflecting lower inflation in goods, while services inflation remained more persistent. Wage pressures, meanwhile, remain strong. Wage growth is expected to become an increasingly important driver of inflation dynamics in the coming months, reflecting employees’ demand for inflation compensation as well as tight labour markets. At the same time, the contribution of profits – which has recently accounted for much of the increase in domestic cost pressures – is declining, suggesting that, as expected, labour cost increases are partly buffered by profits and are not being fully passed on to consumers. Regarding your concerns about the risks of second-round effects, as mentioned in your draft resolution, let me emphasise that our restrictive monetary policy stance, the ensuing strong decline in headline inflation, and firmly anchored longer-term inflation expectations act as a safeguard against a sustained wage-price spiral. Looking forward, we expect inflation to continue slowing down, as the impact of past upward shocks fades, and tight financing conditions help to push down inflation. This brings me to our current monetary policy stance. At our January Governing Council meeting, we considered that the incoming information was broadly in line with our December assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook. We therefore decided to keep our key policy rates unchanged. These interest rates are at levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to ensuring that inflation returns to our 2 % medium-term target in a timely manner. The current disinflationary process is expected to continue, but the Governing Council needs to be confident that it will lead us sustainably to our 2 % target. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction, taking into account the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The shifting economic and geopolitical landscape calls for a strengthening of the euro-area resilience. As you note in your draft resolution, high energy prices and increased geopolitical instability are posing a threat to the euro-area competitiveness. And they are adding to Europe’s existing structural challenges, such as ageing, climate change and digitalisation. To maintain monetary sovereignty and economic prosperity in these challenging times, it is essential for Europe to build up resilience to shocks and invest in strategic autonomy. A unified European policy response should strive to unlock Europe’s potential, focusing on progress in three dimensions: one, independence; two, investment; three, integration. First, we need to make progress on energy independence. Given its proximity to Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, Europe was hit particularly hard by its dependence on energy imports from Russia. To reduce the bloc’s vulnerability to global shocks, improvements in energy security, efficiency and affordability will continue to be vital. European firms’ ability to compete globally will hinge on being less energy dependent. As energy security becomes imperative, Europe will need to boost the roll-out of renewables by increasing investment in clean energy and green technologies, such as green hydrogen and smart energy grids. But the path to greater energy independence also entails considerable investment needs. And this brings me to my second point, which is to foster investment. The European Commission estimates that an extra EUR 620 billion per year will be needed in the next few years to finance Europe’s environmental and climate objectives, with an additional EUR 125 billion required for the digital transition, including the digital euro. But making these investments, as well as addressing shortcomings in the functioning of the financial market, requires further progress on deepening our Economic and Monetary Union, something you highlight in your resolution. Faithfully implementing the EU’s revised economic governance framework will help ensure that fiscal rules reduce high government debt and promote structural reforms and productive public investment, including for the green and digital transitions. I am pleased that EU policymakers, including this Parliament – thank you very much – have recently reached a provisional agreement on the new framework, which should be swiftly and diligently implemented. This will be essential to enhance credibility and anchor expectations about the future course of fiscal policies. Completing European capital market’s union will also be key in financing the twin transition. A fully functioning CMU – and maybe it needs to be called another name, if CMU is not glamorous enough – is needed to foster private financing and complement public investment. We are currently underperforming in this area. Our capital markets remain fragmented and, as a result, lack depth and liquidity, especially when compared with those in the United States. Let me give you two examples. First, the EU trading landscape is characterised by many small exchanges, with three times as many exchange groups as in the United States, and more than ten times as many exchanges for listings. Second, EU venture capital, relative to the size of the economy, is only a small fraction of the size – around one-fifth – of US venture capital. Measures to promote equity financing would provide an opportunity to broaden European firms’ financing options for investing in the technologies that are needed for the twin transition. Europe’s competitiveness and ability to invest also hinge on further progress being made towards banking union. A complete banking union would support more integrated banking services across the euro area and strengthen the global competitiveness of our banking sector. Finally, the third key dimension of a unified European response is the need for deeper integration of our single market to strengthen Europe’s overall competitiveness and resilience. The single market remains incomplete. But it is essential for Europe’s long-term competitiveness. A more integrated single market would help unleash Europe’s growth potential, would boost our shared prosperity. Measures to strengthen the single market could, for example, focus on reducing red tape and excessive regulation, both at the EU and national levels. This would provide incentives to invest and innovate, as 61 % of EU firms consider business regulations to be an obstacle to their investment. In addition, a more competitive and integrated electricity market is also crucial for completing the single market and supporting the green and digital transitions. Progress in this direction would support cross-border trade, investment, and growth. It would also enhance innovation through increased incentives for research and development. The impact of such progress would be considerable. ECB analysis shows that the single market raised the region’s GDP per capita by 12 % to 22 % between 1993 and 2008. A more integrated single market would also strengthen our resilience. We now know that Europe’s heavy reliance on external demand and global supply chains can actually be a weakness. We should therefore leverage and further exploit the full scale of our internal market for goods and services. This will require comprehensive reform, but it has the potential to re-establish the single market as an engine for growth, for innovation and for competitiveness. So, by way of conclusion, Europe has demonstrated – and you have been part of that – its ability to navigate turbulent times. In the face of the current economic and geopolitical challenges, policymakers must be bold enough to take the further steps needed to advance European integration. As Simone Veil remarked in her inaugural speech as President of the European Parliament here in a Plenary session 45 years ago: ‘If the challenges facing Europe are to be met, we need a Europe capable of solidarity, of independence, and of cooperation.’ Her words resonate strongly today. We must seize the opportunity to bolster Europe’s unity and resilience. I know I can count on you, Parliament – and the next one, of which you will hopefully be part – to drive the decisive European action needed to strengthen the euro area. The ECB will continue to play its part, within its mandate. And let me reiterate our unwavering commitment to delivering on price stability, while contributing to the topics I have talked about today, and maintaining an ongoing dialogue with you, the elected representatives of the EU citizens.",-,2024-02-26,15.

And now it’s up to the Member States to adopt the Commission’s proposals, and this needs to be done during the next Environmental Council meeting on 25 March.

The Euro-Mediterranean Agreement between the EU and Israel establishes the general principles for Israel being in programmes such as FP7, Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe. Israel is in flagrant breach of its obligations under the agreement, and the Parliament has totally ignored this violation. For years, Israeli Government agencies, military and security companies that are deeply involved in human rights abuses have been drawing down billions in EU research funds. The Parliament did nothing. Now they are committing genocide in plain sight and you do nothing. Do you call this oversight?

As regards the association of third countries to other EU programmes, the Commission will, of course, act with the same diligence towards the relevant committees. We have had more than 50 interactions with Parliament on associations since the entry of Horizon Europe into force until now.

Ylva Johansson,"Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission is fully committed to protecting public health policymaking from any undue influence of the tobacco industry. This is also our obligation under the World Health Organisation’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and we fully respect it. First, the Commission has a very robust set of rules on ethics and integrity for Commission staff and on transparency. In particular, the Commission requires its top decision makers at political and administrative level to publish information on all meetings they hold with interest representatives. Minutes of all meetings are subject to document management rules and they can be subject to request for access to document. These rules are complemented by dedicated tobacco-specific arrangement and action supplied by the Commission services, with particular responsibility for setting and implementing public health policies with regard to tobacco control. These dedicated arrangement include limiting meetings with industry to those which are strictly necessary for the development of policy, and the publication of reports of all such meetings. Moreover, as recently indicated to the Ombudsman, the Commission has proactively initiated a process to ensure that directors, generals and heads of service as well as all heads of cabinet conduct an assessment of the exposure of their services to the lobbying by tobacco representatives in the context of health policies and policies related to tobacco control, and take necessary actions. Second, the EU tobacco traceability system aims to monitor and reduce the circulation of non-compliant tobacco products which can provide an artificially cheap source of tobacco products, thus impacting on public health, state budgets and legal economic operators. With specific regard to tobacco traceability, the Commission ensures that all data storage providers of the European tobacco traceability system, including Dentsu, comply with strict independence criteria. These criteria aim to ensure the absence of any conflicts of interest by the providers. Ensuring independence from the tobacco industry in both legal and financial terms is central to this policy. Third, I want to stress that the appointment of Dentsu in June last year as the secondary repositories operator in the tobacco traceability system followed all relevant rules and procedures, thereby ensuring transparency. The procurement documents for the relevant procedure have been prepared in conformity with the implementing regulation on the technical standards for the traceability system for tobacco products and with the principle of sound financial management. It is also important to note that the Commission can terminate the contract if the operator of the secondary repository fails to comply with the independence requirements of the implementing regulation, or fails to promptly communicate to the Commission and Member States any occurrences of threats or any other attempts at exercising undue influence that may actually or potentially undermine its independence. Altogether, all the elements I have highlighted concur to build a robust, comprehensive framework with high standards of transparency and accountability, and which is compatible with the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Let me conclude by stating strongly and clearly: public health and transparency are priorities of this Commission and the Commission will continue to be fully committed to protecting public health policymaking from the influence of the tobacco industry.",-,2024-02-08,11.

Malte Gallée,"Mr President, dear Commissioner, I guess we can all agree that the tobacco industry, they are the bad guys. And I guess we can see it also if we look at the trade of tobacco and the illegal trade of tobacco within the EU. I think we lose EUR 20 billion of tax revenue per year just because of the illegal inside EU trade. And this is something that we have to face with the traceability. But what I think is far more important, if we look at traceability and if we look at what taxed revenues we could have, is also to look at the legalisation of weed because if we really are concerned about how we get people to stop smoking, one idea could also be to legalise marijuana to make sure that less people smoke tobacco.

A report by Corporate Europe Observatory has found that in its dealings with the tobacco industry, the Commission has failed to limit contact, refused to disclose information and reactive transparency. With the tobacco industry’s ever-increasing influence used to exploit loopholes and spread mistruths, the Commission must make drastic changes to its transparency protocols. I’d like to ask the Commission how they can justify the appointment of Dentsu tracking without a public tender. I don’t understand why no public tender was required.

He seemed to revel in the fact that it was increasing pain and suffering to the Venezuelan people, and the Biden administration is continuing on with these sanctions.

Mick Wallace,"Mr President, do I think that there’s a healthy democracy in Venezuela? I actually don’t, you know, but I don’t see one anywhere else, either. As my colleague said, over 7 million people have left Venezuela because of the illegal sanctions that have been strangling the country to death since 2017. The Centre for Economic and Policy Research found that in the two years before Trump further tightened the sanctions in 2019, they had killed 40 000 people. The text not only ignores the carnage the sanctions are causing, but calls for more sanctions, this text today. It blames everything on the Government. But have we any humanity? I mean, we actually have blood on our hands. We introduce sanctions to kill the ordinary people. Sanctions hurt the most vulnerable the most, not the leaders and the wealthy in the country. The most vulnerable and women and children suffer more. Our idea of sanctions is to get the people to bring about regime change. Well, we’ve a terrible way of doing it.

Jordi Solé,"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, the participation of third countries sharing our core values and priorities in Union programmes has a positive effect both in the achievements of such programmes and in our cooperation with like-minded partners. This is especially the case in the field of research and innovation, where international cooperation plays a key role in tackling global challenges and fostering mutually beneficial relations. Therefore, association of third countries to Horizon Europe is something that we definitely welcome. However, as a single EU institution directly elected by citizens, we are also here to defend the Parliament’s democratic prerogatives. And as it happens, these prerogatives cannot be fully exercised with the Commission’s approach as regards the conclusion of international agreements related to the participation in Union programmes. The current procedures do not allow the Parliament to have meaningful consent. In our role of safeguarding the democratic and fundamental values of the Union, we should and we must have a bigger say in these agreements. The negotiation, approval and implementation of them is not just a simple administrative procedure without any political connotation. Issues like academic freedom or the need to uphold the climate targets and Green Deal objectives require parliamentary involvement. We welcome the proposal to enhance partnership through New Zealand’s association with the Horizon Europe programme, and the same goes for the agreement with the Faroe Islands. But we have to make sure that there is the proper parliamentary scrutiny under a meaningful consent procedure.

Why did European taxpayers’ money go to fund them in the development of Pegasus spyware that was used to target European journalists and politicians? And why is the EU-Israel Association Agreement still standing in the face of Israel’s genocide? Hundreds of thousands of people across Europe are asking for that agreement to be suspended.

The Commission is committed fully to ensure that the European Parliament can exercise its powers under the Treaties with regard to the association of third countries to EU programmes. In case the Parliament considers that further specific information should be provided during the negotiation and implementation phase of such association agreements in addition to the ample information already provided, the Commission is prepared to do so.

I particularly welcome the emphasis on the importance of multilateralism in general and the WTO in particular, in the current challenging geopolitical context. As you know, the EU is playing a leading role in sustaining and reforming the WTO as this multilateralism is in our DNA. MC13 in Abu Dhabi starts in less than three weeks. On behalf of Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis, I would like to underline that there is a lot of work to be done in the run-up to the conference and a lot of work to do during the conference itself. Replicating the success of MC12 in 2022 will be extremely challenging, but we must be able to show that the process of WTO reform launched at MC12 is on track, and that we can and will deliver a more effective organisation. In the Commission’s view, a package for MC13 should include the following six components: substantial progress on dispute settlement reform; concluding phase two of the Fisheries Subsidies negotiations; a pathway for agriculture towards MC14; the extension of the e-commerce moratorium and associated work programme; making the WTO a forum to discuss trade and industrial policy and the interface between trade and environment, updating the ‘deliberative function’, in WTO jargon; a package for developing countries. The first and most important of these for the EU is dispute settlement reform. Indeed, a binding dispute settlement system at the WTO has been one of the greatest achievements of this organisation, and we are now counting the costs of its absence with an erosion of respect for WTO rules, including through so-called ‘appeals into the void’. In other words, appeals to a non-functioning appellate body. For MC13, the principle that there should be a reformed appellate body and a time frame to have this issue resolved would be the minimum we would hope to achieve. As Members of this House are well aware, the conclusion of phase one of the Fisheries Subsidies Agreement at MC12 was an example of the WTO’s concrete contribution to implementing the UN Sustainable Development Goals. It now behoves us to complete the work at MC13. However, the entry into force of the phase one Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies still remains uncertain as we have not reached the threshold of ratifications, despite the EU having shown leadership in already having ratified it last year. We thus continue to rally the remaining members to ratify the Agreement. With regard to the so-called ‘phase two Agreement’, we are working hard to conclude it by MC13. Unfortunately, divergences of members’ positions have grown. Agriculture will be an important file at MC13, not least given the global food insecurity context, but also given its link to development and to environmental sustainability. Outcomes at MC13 should, on one hand, address the current food security challenges, in particular for the most vulnerable WTO members and, on the other, help advanced agricultural reform towards MC14. In our view, the focus should be on reforming trade-distorting domestic support and finding a solution to the issue of public stockholding for food security purposes. It will be important for the EU to continue promoting the reforms towards more environmentally sustainable policies, in line with the approach in our own agricultural policy. The renewal of the e-commerce moratorium is crucial to maintain business support for the WTO. It’s also the key contribution from the WTO to the digital transition. We are in a better position now than at a comparable time before MC12, as we have over 100 members, including the ACP countries supporting the extension. As a fundamental component of the reform of the organisation, MC13 should ensure that the WTO becomes the forum for policy discussions on current global challenges affecting the trading system. One key challenge is the growing use of industrial policies, including industrial subsidies, by governments across the world. Another key challenge is the interface between trade and the environment. At MC13, we will need to deliver a development package to unlock a broader set of outcomes on other topics. We can achieve this by mainstreaming development considerations into all aspects of the WTO agenda. The package should include a solution for the graduation of least developed countries, so that they can still benefit from certain LDC advantages as they grow out of the LDC status. On a final note, I would like to highlight the conclusions of the negotiations on services, domestic regulation and investment facilitation for development. At MC13, we will most likely see a request for the integration of the Investment Facilitation Agreement into the WTO Agreement. These developments are important from the perspective of showing that the WTO can deliver negotiated outcomes. Honourable Members, the complex geopolitics, divergent positions and negotiation tactics will make it challenging to reach agreements at MC13 on all the issues I have outlined here. We are sure to have several sleepless nights, as was the case at MC12, but at MC12 we managed to achieve what DG Okonjo-Iweala called ‘the miracle on the lake’. The EU is fully committed to lead the charge and to work towards a ‘miracle on the gulf’ in Abu Dhabi.",-,2024-02-08,"3.

Jana Toom,"Mr President, dear colleagues, Commissioner, I am speaking here on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, but I’m also inspired by the teacher strike which ended in Estonia a few days ago. After several days of strike, our underpaid and overworked teachers got a salary increase of EUR 17 per month. And I am speaking about the country which, according to PISA tests, remains on top of EU ratings. There is a critical need in our societies for high-quality education to prepare pupils to lead successful, fulfilling lives and contribute meaningfully to their communities by providing them with relevant educational experiences, developing practical skills, acquisitions and problem-solving abilities, as well as by fostering critical thinking, creativity and adaptivity. The aim of the oral question we are discussing today is to address one of the challenges faced in attaining high-quality education. Namely, the situation of teachers and of the teaching profession in the European Union, as the teaching standards are closely linked to the resources made available to them, their training opportunities, as well as to the roles they are asked to fulfil. The reality we are confronted to nowadays is that the EU faces an ageing teaching population, the difficulty of recruiting and retaining qualified teachers, severe teacher shortages especially in rural areas, inadequate salary levels, the lack of collective bargaining agreements, as well as accentuated psychological pressure related to increased levels of violence in schools, bigger classroom sizes coupled with often decreased quality of infrastructure and multiplied administrative tasks assigned to them. The Committee on Petitions has received several petitions highlighting these aspects in recent years, the most recent one having been discussed last autumn in the Committee. In light of these discussions, it is imperative that we address the following questions: what is the assessment of the current state of working conditions of teachers in the European Union, and the effects on the quality of education and the transmission of fundamental knowledge? Which are the instruments the Commission makes available to Member States to assist them to implement relevant improvements in school education systems, considering the evolving demands of the labour market and correlated education needs, and necessity of continuous professional development and upskilling, as well as the importance of infrastructure investments? Which are the strategies the Commission foresees for levelling up the prestige and attractiveness of the teaching profession, including in rural, outmost and depopulated areas, to fight against negative demographic trends? How is the Commission encouraging the development of clear career prospects and attractive pay for the teaching profession? How is the Commission monitoring the implementation of Directive (EU) 2019/1152 on transparent and predictable working conditions in relation to the teaching profession in the EU? Which further actions does it intend to take to guarantee the full compliance with its provisions, including as regards the right to collective agreements?",Renew,2024-02-08,4.

Iliana Ivanova,"Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I would like to thank, first of all, the chair of the PETI Committee, honourable Member Montserrat, for bringing forward this important issue on the working conditions of teachers in the European Education Area. I would also like to thank Vice-Chair Toom, who is presenting the point today. Teacher shortages are a serious cause of concern, which is shared by us all. This is also confirmed by the recent PISA results. Not even one Member State managed to improve their performance in basic skills. And if we are to contribute to a solution to this challenge, which is so important for our competitiveness, teachers are a fundamental part of the answer. That is why the Commission continues to strongly support the efforts of the Member States to tackle these complex challenges, and it is also one of the key priorities for me during this mandate. We have already dedicated several reports and studies to assessing the situation of teachers in all EU Member States. We have also developed a brand new indicators dashboard. This interactive online tool provides comparative information supporting Member States’ decisions regarding the teaching profession. The Commission also uses all policy and funding instruments at its disposal to support Member States in improving their school education systems, and in training and preparing teachers to meet their professional challenges. For example, the European Education Area Strategic Framework offers a forum for discussion and collaboration through its working groups, composed of experts nominated by the Member States and key stakeholders. These working groups have fed into several of our policy initiatives, and we can see some of this work in the many Council recommendations that underline the key role of school leaders, teachers and other educational staff. We also, of course, support Member States through funding. Both the European Social Fund and the Recovery and Resilience Facility invest in measures, reforms and investments supporting education, training and skills at all levels, including in the teaching profession. And, of course, our flagship education programme, Erasmus+, supports Member States by providing professional development opportunities to teachers. And then there are also the new Erasmus+ teacher academies. They aim to equip teachers to deal with common challenges, from inclusion and equity to digital education or sustainable development. Some 27 Teacher Academies projects have been initiated, exceeding the initial goal of having 25 Teacher Academies by 2025 and, given the interest, a new call has just been launched for 15 additional projects in 2024. Yet, in addition to resources and investment, recognition is also a fundamental part of our strategy. Besides this being reflected in many Council conclusions and recommendations, we have also launched the Innovative European Teaching Award 2021 to give credit to teachers for their work and to identify and promote outstanding teaching and learning practices developed through collaboration between schools within the Erasmus+ programme. Last but not least, the Commission is taking careful note of the coverage of the teaching profession when checking the transposition and implementation of the existing legal instruments related to working conditions and fixed-term work, including infringements addressed to a few Member States. Now, I am really looking forward to hearing your views.",-,2024-02-08,4.

Reinhard Bütikofer,"Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, the perpetually repeated news about the imminent death of the WTO has been vastly exaggerated. And that is good, because we need the WTO. Commissioner Johansson, you have pointed out the priorities that are at the centre of our agenda, and I agree, we agree. We need dispute settlement. We need to avoid digital trade tariffs. We need mainstreaming of development. We need a solution for fisheries subsidies. And, of course, we also need, and particularly urgently, greening trade, making trade a positive tool, not an obstacle. The resolution that we have in front of us addresses these issues and that’s why the group line of my group is to support the resolution. That will not be shared by all our colleagues, because some of us have different understandings of the meaning of the word ‘compromise’. But compromise is exactly what we will need at an international level, and in particular at MC13, in our efforts to hold on to a multilateral trade system through timely reforms. We have understood that we must also use different tools. We have introduced unilateral measures, but we also run into the obvious reality that unilateral measures are not always well coordinated with our international relations. We have tried bilateralism and just saw how Australia showed us the middle finger. We have advocated plurilateralism and harvested minilateralisms that fragment the trade world. This is why holding on to the perspective of a multilateral trade order is in the interest of the European Union, of all its citizens, and of our partners around the globe.",Greens/EFA,2024-02-08,"3.

Monica Semedo,"Mr President, dear Commissioner, you stated that many teachers have difficulties transferring basic knowledge. In my experience, some teachers do more than transferring basic knowledge. In my third grade, I had a teacher who made me write essays all the time. I found it a bit annoying back then, but nowadays I am thankful to Mrs Cook because I became a journalist before becoming a politician. And that’s why each pupil deserves a teacher that has the will, the vocation and the time to identify and foster one’s potential. A teacher can be a guide, a mentor, an inspiration and even a role model. Teachers with better working conditions – for example, who do not face overcrowded classrooms – can afford to dedicate more time to their students. And this is the quality education we all call for. Therefore, Member States must invest in their education systems to guarantee better working conditions for teachers and realise smaller classrooms. And on a final note, we must guarantee equal access to quality education for all. We must avoid students being segregated and zero tolerance for discrimination related to origin, condition, disability or socioeconomic background.

Barry Andrews,"Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, like the last speaker, I am a former schoolteacher and can personally attest to the challenging but incredibly rewarding nature of the teaching profession. However, the rising cost of living, long commutes and rising populations have led to a teacher retention crisis across the European Union. A recent survey carried out by the Teachers’ Union of Ireland showed 64% of schools have unfilled vacancies, and another by the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland (ASTI) showed 75% of schools surveyed received no applications for teaching posts advertised. This is affecting the most vulnerable and special education disproportionately. Free school books for the junior cycle and the Public Sector Pay Agreement are very welcome, but I would encourage the Irish Government to engage with unions on disputes about incremental payments for teachers returning from abroad. Ireland performs extremely well on PISA surveys, and such engagement would be a practical recognition of that performance.",Renew,2024-02-08,4.

Mick Wallace,"Mr President, In Ireland we have a serious teacher shortage also. Many schools say they have been forced to plug staffing gaps by redeploying special education teachers. This will have a devastating impact on more vulnerable pupils. Now we have plenty of people qualifying as teachers in Ireland, and the problem is not the profession: the problem is the chronic lack of accommodation in the country. Many teachers have no option but to move abroad. Sadly, this has all been self-inflicted by successive Irish governments implementing neoliberal housing policies. Between 2002 and 2022, wages in Ireland increased by 27 %, residential property prices increased by 75 % over the same period and rents increased by 90 %. The average Dublin rent is now over EUR 2 000 a month, and that’s equivalent to the entire monthly take-home pay of a newly qualified teacher. Newly qualified teachers in Ireland earn EUR 41 000 per year, but the average salary needed to buy a three-bed home in the Greater Dublin area is EUR 126 000.

Iliana Ivanova,"Mr President, Honourable Members, dear teachers in the gallery, I thank you very much for your very valuable comments and remarks. Dear colleagues, I thank you for the importance and respect you attach to the crucial role of the teaching profession. I reiterate that within the limits of its remit, the Commission is committed to deploying a number of funding instruments to support the Member States’ efforts in addressing this multifaceted challenge. There were a number of questions about what more the EU can do to help, besides what I mentioned in the beginning. Let me just recall the key role of the EU funding invested in education. Around EUR 73 billion have been programmed for education under the Recovery and Resilience Facility, supporting education and skills development, with a strong focus on digital education. The national RRF plans include several investments and reforms linked to the teaching profession, to name a few. Teachers can receive training in digital skills, or in how to work with disadvantaged pupils; they can participate in e-learning courses, or they can receive financial support to purchase electronic equipment, for instance, for teaching purposes. Under the European Social Fund Plus, more than EUR 43 billion have been programmed to support measures targeting education, training and skills. Among these investments are, again, multiple measures supporting teachers in the development of their competence frameworks, their upskilling, their career paths and in working in rural and multicultural environments. I want to reassure you that I am fully committed to doing the utmost for us to help, together, to restore the attractiveness of one of the noblest professions.",-,2024-02-08,4.

Clara Ponsatí Obiols,"Mr President, the teaching profession is in crisis because we are failing to attain and retain enough talented and motivated professionals. In my country, in the 80s, we set up a language immersion model to normalise Scotland after the years of persecution under Franco’s dictatorship. This very ambitious project attracted thousands of bright young graduates, especially women, that were the bedrock of our schools for three decades. This internationally recognised model is now in crisis, not least because of the vicious attack of the Spanish nationalists, and our education system is deteriorating even more than in comparable countries. Those great teachers, the founding mothers of Catalan schools, have retired and now, when the job is the most challenging, the new generation does not have the qualifications or the incentives to become, as their predecessors, the backbone of our society. My prescription to governments everywhere is to tackle the education crisis with the same for the Catalan government: be ambitious, be courageous, demand more of your teachers, train them properly.

Christian Ehler,"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, colleagues, there are two things we need to make clear, very clear today. First, Parliament is a strong supporter of the participation of New Zealand in the Union’s programmes. We are strong supporters of other countries like the Faroe Islands, Canada and South Korea participating in our programmes. The resolution we will adopt today makes it very clear we have no problem with those countries and their participation in the Union’s programmes. However, and this is the second point, Parliament will not accept that its democratic prerogatives are disregarded. The Treaties are clear: only Parliament’s consent can make the Union plausibly accept to set up a committee under the international agreement with the power to amend certain parts of the international agreement. I repeat: only if Parliament gives consent. The Court of Justice also made clear that Parliament’s consent must be meaningful. The Council and the Commission have chosen to ignore this constitutional reality. They have insisted on setting up association agreements for the Union programmes with a completely new category of third countries, which cut the parliaments out completely. They have asked the Parliament to sign a chèque en blanc. Therefore, the Parliament cannot give meaningful consent to these agreements, and we have communicated this clearly to other institutions for almost two years. It’s an insult of the services, and I addressed specifically the Secretary-General that she is refusing to take up interinstitutional dialogue, although Parliament’s President had asked for that a year ago. So this resolution is our last attempt to change the course of the Council and the Commission. The only step left us after this is to start denying consent, which will kill these agreements. We do not want to do this: researchers involved in Horizon should not become the victim of this interinstitutional fight, but we protect our democratic prerogatives. We will do that, whatever it takes. So I would have to read you the following question, also in the name of my co-rapporteur, Mr Lacapelle. As regards international agreements dedicated to the participation of third countries in the Union programmes, the Commission is asked the following: given the broad powers allocated to the Joint Committee established under the draft agreement between the EU and New Zealand – including its ability to adopt and amend the protocols on associations to Union programmes without further parliamentary involvement – how does the Commission intend to ensure that Parliament retains oversight and power of consent as regards future associations to the Union programmes? Secondly, can the Commission commit to increase transparency of the implementation of the agreements via regular and detailed reporting in order to enable Parliament to exercise its oversight rights? Will the Commission structure future agreements in a way that guarantees the respect of Parliament’s prerogatives concerning agreements on any association to a Union programme? Will the Commission launch negotiations on an interinstitutional agreement that completely abides by both the letter and the spirit of the Treaties in full respect of the principles of parliamentary scrutiny in the implementation of the association agreements, including as regards the adoption and amendment of protocols? And, I may add, this might be today a conversation of connoisseurs, and we might not have a lot of participation because it’s very specific. Believe me, there will be a lot of presence if Parliament is going to deny consent to these agreements.",PPE,2024-02-08,5.

One would think Lukashenka gives up this charade after 30 years, but no, he has to pretend he still has power over the country. And thus the authorities got inspired in Russia and North Korea, I guess, and intensified their oppression of journalists, lawyers, activists and even families of those who ran away. As if people in Belarus would not know, without mass protests in the streets, that the system is rigged and Lukashenka should be out. As if we here in the European Union could acknowledge his regime this time around if only he silenced all opposition. No, no, no, no, no! Our sanctions will remain. Our support to opposition remains, and our help to get people out and grant them asylum and support remains. Let’s have a coordinated response at the European level.

Theresa Bielowski,"Madam President, dear colleagues, LGBTIQ rights – and I want to make that very clear – are not the rights of this or that percentage of people. They are all of our rights because we can never settle for a society that’s almost fair, for rule of law being almost upheld or for fundamental rights including almost everybody, almost everywhere. So rights need defence, constant defence, and they need it in politics, on the streets, in institutions even in our own homes. We carry a responsibility for keep on creating laws that finally protect queer people from hate, from discrimination, from hostility and also from violence. Also, that only will do justice to the hundreds of thousands of activists that fight for freedom, for the right to live a safe and good life every day. So to all you activists out there, thank you.

The rights to freedom of expression, of assembly and freedom against torture and arbitrary detention are bastions of a democratic and free society, and rights which the European Union has committed itself to protecting. We have a duty, therefore, to stand up against these injustices against the people of Belarus when we see them.

Marc Angel,"Madam President, dear colleagues, thank you so very much, dear Commissioner Helena Dalli. Your LGBTI Equality Strategy is already a success, as such. For the first time in EU history, our Union is committed to tackle discrimination not only on the grounds of sex and sexual orientation but also on gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics and not forgetting intersectionality. However, a lot still needs to be done to achieve a real Union of Equality. We should not forget that still today, part of our society is victim of discrimination, harassment and violence, merely as a result of the person they are or they love, be they lesbian, gay, bi, trans, non-binary or intersex persons. The Union of Equality is above all, a Union that puts human dignity at the core of our society. In this context, the renewal of the LGBTI strategy after 2025 is a priority. Dear Commissioner, this House, with large majorities, has issued clear calls for a Union that ensures safe and inclusive sex education from early childhood, a Union that protects minorities from hate speech and hate crime, a Union that bans conversion practices, a Union that recognises marriage and parenthood of rainbow families. Our fight for equality is far more than a political debate in this House. It is a societal topic and it is so good to see in the last Eurobarometer that growing majorities of our citizens are supporting LGBTIQ rights. This is a reality, despite the loud voices of haters. Human rights will always prevail.",S&D,2024-02-07,18.

Helena Dalli,"Madam President, honourable Members, I wish to thank you for giving me this opportunity to address this Chamber on the important topic of implementation of the first ever Commission LGBTIQ Equality Strategy. Now, more than halfway into implementing this strategy, the Commission is working on a mid-term review that will assess how the situation of LGBTIQ people has evolved since it was adopted, the progress made, and which areas require more focus to fully implement the strategy by 2025, considering the challenges identified and revealed by data. In April 2023, the Commission published a progress report presenting numerous actions undertaken to implement this strategy at the EU level in the period up to February 2023. The mid-term report will also reflect on opinions of stakeholders provided through an extensive consultation process, including Member States and civil society organisations. The Commission plans to adopt it in the second quarter of 2024. Your implementation report and your reflections today will also be an important contribution to this process. Since its adoption, the strategy has contributed to improving many people’s lives and to build more equal and welcoming societies for LGBTIQ people. The strategy has been implemented using intersectionality as a cross-cutting principle. Sexual orientation, gender identity, expression, and or sex characteristics have been considered alongside other personal characteristics or identities such as sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion, belief, disability, and age. According to a Eurobarometer survey in 2023, compared to 2019 Europeans now are more likely to feel comfortable having a lesbian, gay or bisexual colleague: 75 %. That is three points higher than in 2019. Or if one of their children is in a same sex relationship: 59 %, which is four points higher. Although these figures are still lower when it comes to trans and intersex people. A growing number of Member States are stepping up their commitment for LGBTIQ equality in accordance with the LGBTIQ Equality Strategy. 12 of them have in place dedicated LGBTIQ action plans or strategies, and a growing number of Member States are working to adopt their first ever national LGBTIQ Action Plans, in line with the Commission’s strategy and the guidelines prepared by the LGBTIQ equality subgroup, building our Union of equality on strong national foundations. Also, more Member States are introducing human rights based legal gender recognition procedures, strengthening the recognition and protection for same sex couples and rainbow families, and extending the scope of protection from discrimination to gender identity, gender expression, and sex characteristics. While these are important steps forward, ongoing backlashes are a reminder that progress towards LGBTIQ equality can be very fragile. Our Eurobarometer survey also showed that in 2023, 54 % of all respondents thought that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is widespread in their country, compared to 53 % in 2019. This percentage rises to 57 % in relation to being a transgender person, which is a 9 % increase, and 47 % say that discrimination against intersex persons is widespread. An 8 % increase. According to ILGA-Europe’s 2023 annual review, 2022 was the most violent year for LGBTQI people across the region in the past decade, both through planned attacks and through suicides in the wake of rising and widespread hate speech. So even in countries where social acceptance is higher, certain political forces increased their efforts to curtail LGBTIQ rights, fuelling violence and hate against LGBTIQ people for political gain. Against the surge in violence and discrimination, the EU has not hesitated to act. We remain vigilant and continue working with Member States, civil society organisations and other institutions to uphold the human rights of LGBTIQ people through the implementation of our LGBTIQ equality strategy. The Commission continues monitoring the implementation of EU law in Member States, and we do not hesitate to take action, of course, as you know, including initiating infringement procedures in case the fundamental rights of LGBTIQ people are violated. The hatred we have recently seen is a risk for our societies and for our democracy. We cannot accept that people are prevented from playing their full part due to how they look, what they believe, who they love, or where they come from. We are determined to combat hatred, scapegoating, and the denigration of any person due to their racial and ethnic origin, their faith, their gender, or their sexuality. And December 2023, the Commission and the High Representative adopted a joint communication on ‘No place for hate: a Europe united against hatred’, which aims to step up EU efforts to fight hatred in all its forms, including LGBTIQ people, of course.",-,2024-02-07,16.

And it is truly a victory for our community to see this allyship from the Commission. And some very good first steps were taken. But I’m asking you now, please continue having our backs. Despite the growing backlash, despite the fact that my community is scapegoated for political gains and despite the increased hate against us, please continue to work with a new commissioner responsible for equality and a new strategy. Because we are still far away from a Europe where we are truly equal, where we are truly safe. We deserve to be treated equally. And for this we need the horizontal anti-discrimination directive to be unblocked. We want to be able to move throughout the Union without fear of losing our legal rights as partners or as parents. Our intersex siblings need to be protected with a ban on genital mutilation. Our trans siblings deserve to have a passport that reflects who they are without going through long and medicalised degrading processes. And we want a ban on the torturous practice of conversion therapy. In other words, we would like to have our basic human rights to be respected in the EU.

Let me speak on one particular part of this strategy. It was already mentioned before: conversion practices. I thank the Commission for having the citizens’ initiative approved, and I hope that in the next months we will have much more than 1 million people signing the citizens’ initiative in order to stop this abominable way of manipulating children’s minds, people’s minds, in order to make them change whoever they were born into. This is an abomination and it must be stopped all across the European Union! We did this in Malta – we were the first country to do so – and it must be stopped in all the countries of the European Union.

The targets for the next UN Women Conference here, too. So, it is the bigger issue with the totalitarianism and negative developments in our societies in the EU that I think that we should tackle really seriously. And then what are the tools? Of course, the tools are very much in all the groups the same. It is zero tolerance for any kind of hate speech, legally binding rules – both in digital media and in real life – for this boiling effect of insulting people because of their backgrounds. We need to back up the people, the diversity and stop the hate speech as long as we can. The next steps are two things. First of all – I am campaigning and very great supporter – we really would need to ban conversion therapies in Europe. They are against human rights, they are against dignity and they are against everything that we know about medicine and the good physical care of people. We would need to have better compulsory education about the issue and we would need to have special social and medical streams and services for LGBTIQ people.

Maria Walsh,"Madam President, Commissioner, as always, here for a late-night debate on LGBTI rights. Thank you very much for your continued support. Colleagues, the right to equal treatment and non-discrimination is a fundamental right enshrined in the EU Treaties. On 8 March, Ireland will hold two referendums that directly impact the LGBTI+ community: one question focuses on the family and the second on care. These are progressive referendums that, in my eyes, will ensure the empowerment of our citizens to shape their country’s future, uphold democratic values, and promote equality, dignity and respect for all families. Let me focus on the first one, which is to amend Article 41. The positive impact in revising the definition of ‘family’ is to explicitly provide a wider concept of family beyond just the traditional concept of marriage. If passed, we will recognise the diversity of families that exist in our society, ensuring rainbow families, one-parent families and couples – regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity – are recognised in the Irish Constitution, acknowledging their rights as equal members of our society. I urge Irish people to continue to follow the path to progress, to vote and safeguard the rights for families and gender equality, and collectively continue to adapt our Constitution to a modern Europe in a modern European Union. Constitutional change sends a powerful message of acceptance, equality and inclusion. This is the type of Member State and EU change we need to see progress in the future of all and any LGBTI strategies. I welcome this review. I’m just always disappointed – and I’m going to use my last few seconds here – to say that at 8 o’clock at night yet again on a Wednesday of plenary, we have about less than 30 colleagues, led by Commissioner Dalli, in probably one of the most politically incised conversations we have in our time. LGBTQ+ communities, minority groups, people who are seen as ‘other’ will be used as a political ping pong game.

I think that, while asking those questions and liking to see these issues put the spotlight on, we have to say that it’s very regrettable that our credibility in raising these issues is seriously undermined by the fact that, inside the EU, we also have people arbitrarily arrested who are opposition journalists and so on.

Sirpa Pietikäinen,"Mr President, globally, we have three priorities at the moment in gender and women’s rights. Firstly, we have had very good progress, but backlash through the growing populism and totalitarianism is threatening women’s rights. It’s increasing hate speech, it’s increasing attitudes limiting women’s personal rights, democratic rights, sexual and reproductive rights, and their rights in the work life. So the whole set of strengthening legally and globally and in all Member States, the right-based approach is the first priority and zero tolerance of hatred towards the gender of women in any forms. Second priority is, of course, the integration of women and gender aspects in all parts of the policies. And this, again, is this old-fashioned discussion about quotas – quotas in business life, quotas in public life and quotas in decision-making. And this is something that I hope that the EU could step up in the global sphere in its talks. And last but not least is, of course, the poverty issue. Issues like pay transparency can work when we are actually dealing with the fact that women are not either getting the same salary for the same work, not to talk about for the same value of the work. And by tackling the pay transparencies, we can tackle the poverty in one part and with the social security on the other part.",PPE,2024-02-07,15.

Monika Vana,"Mr President, dear Commissioner, dear colleagues, it’s a very crucial moment for gender equality. I am a member of the EP delegation to CSU since 2016 and for this year, the task is clear, I guess. We have to secure the last years’ achievements, especially on SRHR, intersectionality and the important role of civil society organisations as well as our fight against the backlash. It is of utmost importance that we finally advance towards a feminist foreign policy, as supported by the European Parliament in the GAP III. This year’s priority theme of the CSW on women’s poverty and the review theme on public services are long overdue. According to the fact that 383 million women and girls live in extreme poverty and lack social infrastructure. The persistent gender pay and pension gaps, precarious employment and the underrepresentation of women in decision making show systematic inequalities that have dramatically worsened due to the multiple crises we face, such as climate change, rising costs of living, the pandemic and wars. For me, it’s obvious: we urgently need a decent minimum income for anyone and institutionalised gender budgeting across all policy areas. Therefore, the strong EP resolution we vote on tomorrow is needed. And as usual, as also my dear colleague Robert Biedrón emphasised already, I want to point out the absolute necessity of ensuring the full involvement of the European Parliament and the FEMM Committee in the decision-making process before and during the CSW in order to strengthen our collective voice and shape together the final conclusions of the CSW.",Greens/EFA,2024-02-07,15.

Our report sends a clear message: women and young girls are integral to the rapid advancements shaping our future world. And even as these changes sometimes carry biases against us – examples are found in tech, health and the labour market – we need to keep fighting for these equal rights. Also, in times of crisis and conflict, women find themselves disadvantaged disproportionately, and this is even a soft statement. We are speaking of weaponisation of gender-based violence and other atrocities that are becoming more common, atrocities that are beyond imagination. It is therefore essential to keep raising awareness on these matters and not forget about silent conflicts or situations that remain underrepresented. Remember and understand that we make up half the global population and are indispensable in critical areas such as the energy transition, the combat against climate change, or the settlements of violent conflicts. So in New York, we will reiterate our commitment to gender equality and for equal opportunities for access to sexual health and reproductive rights, equal pay, making sure that we don’t have a pay gap any more in this world, all of which are non-negotiable in our opinion.

Now Lukashenka’s regime is systematically targeting family members of political prisoners, mostly wives and mothers. We again urge Lukashenka to release all political prisoners, their families and the detained persons. Moreover, Lukashenka’s regime has been involved in a forced transfer of Ukrainian children, which is a war crime. Same as Putin, we need to treat Lukashenka also as a war criminal. At this point, it is clear that the upcoming Belarusian election will not meet worldwide standards. That is why we call on the EU, its Member States and the international community not to recognise the results. The High Representative and the Council need to impose stronger sanctions on the Lukashenka regime. We will learn something from Putin’s war: the sanctions are working.

Robert Biedroń,"Mr President, dear Commissioner, colleagues, thank you very much. Next month a delegation of the FEMM Committee will go to New York to represent this Parliament at the 68th Commission on the Status of Women organised by the United Nations, called, in short, the CSU. This is the biggest inter-governmental body dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women. This year, the conference will focus on achieving gender equality through addressing women’s poverty. It will also focus on gender budgeting and gender mainstreaming. The principles that we, as the FEMM Committee, have been asking to fully incorporate into the works of our institutions for a long time. We will go there with a good message. As a representative of this House, we can say that we have fought hard and adopted some key files this term, like the Pay Transparency Directive or the Women on Boards Directive, to name just a few. Yesterday we also finalised the negotiations on the Directive on Combating Violence against Women, which is a great success and a revolutionary law coming from our continent. All this shows that we, as the European Union, are global leaders when it comes to fighting for gender equality. Remaining to be a global leader it is the fight and achieving true gender equality in our union should be our shared ambition and our joint commitment. But dear colleagues, we still have a long, long way to go. The European Institute for Gender Equality tells us that, at this pace of progress, it will take us 60 years to say that men and women are truly equal in our Union. It is a long time, but dear colleagues, at last year’s CSW, we learned that globally it would take around 300 years to achieve gender equality. 300 years! This is completely unacceptable. It sounds like it cannot be true. But then, when I think about it, even here in the EU, recent data shows that 95 million people live at risk of poverty, and that it is women that are more likely to end up in this tragic situation. The gender pay gap is still at 30 %, and women are still under-represented in the decision-making bodies, including this House. And I could go on and on and on colleagues to give more examples. This is why on this international stage, we must show our joint commitment to this fight. We must remain global leaders in gender equality policy, and this we can only do when we are united. Unfortunately, dear Commissioner, I do not see the Minister, but in the past that has not been the case. We as European Parliament have been sidelined in the past during such high-level meetings. We did not even receive access to the EU position document ahead of the negotiations. We like to say as European Union that we are all Team Europe, but sometimes it seems that we are split Europe and it is really, again, a shame. That is why we address those questions to the Commission and the Council to present us a clear plan of our Union in this matter. How can we ensure that we continue to adopt relevant legislation helping women and girls in the EU and worldwide? How how are the principles of gender mainstreaming and gender budgeting implemented in the EU? And how can we ensure that we, as the delegation of the European Parliament, are fully involved? I underline fully involved, Commissioner, in the negotiations and conclusions during this year’s CSW. Side by side, united Team Europe with the representatives of the Commission and the Council.

Ultimately, this proposal gives new opportunities for farmers.

We should answer to the demands and concerns of our most vulnerable citizens. The right to access decent and affordable housing is at the heart of the social Europe that we want to strengthen. To turn this right into a reality for every person in the EU, we need to make sure that we have in place the adequate housing and employment and social policies.

Chris MacManus,"Mr President, I want to welcome this debate on the 70th anniversary of Abbé Pierre’s appeal on addressing homelessness. His appeal, which centred on the belief in the fundamental right to shelter and the need for immediate action to address homelessness, is as relevant today as it was 70 years ago. In Ireland, we have had successive Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael governments setting records they should be ashamed of. They’ve consistently overseen increase after increase in the number of homeless people in Ireland. Indeed, just before Christmas, a new record was set. The number of homeless people in Ireland surpassed 13 000: 13 179 to be precise, 3 991 of them children. That is the highest number of homeless children ever recorded in our state. Indeed, a government of record-breakers. They should hang their collective heads in shame. If the Irish Government are serious about tackling the housing and homelessness crises, they must reinstate the ban on no-fault evictions in order to create the space for an emergency response to be put in place. We need a package of measures to reduce the number of people becoming homeless in Ireland. We need to stop vulture and cuckoo funds evicting families or buying up the housing stock from under the noses of workers and families. A chairde, we need a new approach that puts people ahead of vested and financial interests. Only then may our children sleep easy.",The Left,2024-02-07,20.

Kim Van Sparrentak,"Mr President, in 1954, war-ridden France was experiencing a serious housing crisis. It was a freezing winter and thousands of people were sleeping on the streets. On 1 February, Abbé Pierre, outraged by the death of a homeless woman that still carried the eviction notice on her, launched a radio appeal for solidarity. Seventy years later, still, every night homeless people are dying in our cities. Every single night, 900 000 people sleep on the streets or in shelters. We could lose all hope and accept this as a fact of life. But it doesn’t have to be this way. We have the tools to halt growing rates of homelessness in the EU and even end homelessness for good. We see in Finland, with the Housing First approach, that this is possible. We need to move away from ‘managing’ homelessness and ‘charity only’ to solving it. This was also recognised by all Member States in the Lisbon Declaration that took on board the call of the European Parliament to work on ending homelessness by 2030. Several countries since then have adopted new strategies and work at the European level to better coordinate action, share knowledge and streamline funding has started. On Friday, I will represent the European Parliament at the ministerial meeting on homelessness hosted by the Belgian Presidency. This will be a key moment to ensure that the platform on combating homelessness is continued and strengthened in a new mandate, with a new work plan and a dedicated budget. The ministers gathering should agree to work on Council recommendations on homelessness to underpin the work of the platform and give guidance to the strategies of EU countries. Furthermore, we have to make sure that we continue combating the housing crisis, because solving homelessness can’t happen if people are continuing to become homeless. Also, knowing that the EU’s five richest billionaires increased their wealth since 2020 –from EUR 244 billion to EUR 429 billion, at a rate of EUR 5.7 million per hour – I think we simply cannot accept the most extreme form of poverty to continue to exist.",Greens/EFA,2024-02-07,20.

Helena Dalli,"Mr President, today we celebrate 70 years since Abbé Pierre launched his appeal for political action on poverty on 1 February 1954. It is therefore only fitting to ask ourselves – what is the state of homelessness, poverty and exclusion in Europe today? What have we done in this regard? The share of the population at risk of poverty or social exclusion has remained broadly constant over the past years, despite the repeated shocks and crises. This can be largely attributed to effective policies and social transfers. Notwithstanding all our efforts faced with repeated economic and social challenges, homelessness keeps increasing in most Member States. According to estimates by the European Federation of National Organisations Working with the Homeless and the Fondation Abbé Pierre, at least 895 000 people are currently homeless in Europe. So we must renew our commitment to fight homelessness. Successful examples have one clear element in common: consistency of action and long-term planning and investment. Increasing the supply of affordable housing, and, in particular, public housing and social housing, is key. As the European Commission, we are of course playing a role in this. The European Platform on Combatting Homelessness, launched in Lisbon in 2021, brings together national authorities, civil society and European institutions to combat homelessness in the EU with a Housing First approach. The Platform has become a reference point for national decision makers and the establishment of national homelessness strategies in an increasing number of Member States and, based on the work of the platform, this is a visible sign of its achievements. The social innovation call launched by the Commission, which is currently in the evaluation phase, will further support innovative grassroots projects. Furthermore, housing—led policies towards homeless people require the appropriate level of financial resources, of course, so Member States have programmed close to EUR 15 billion in their national recovery and resilience plans in connected investments and reforms, including following country—specific recommendations. The InvestEU programme dedicates a EUR 2.8 billion guarantee to social investments and skills, so this allows leveraging substantial investments on affordable housing and student housing. Cohesion policy funds, notably the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund Plus contribute to building an integrated approach to housing for vulnerable groups. For instance, about EUR 1 billion from the European Regional Development Fund have been directly allocated to investments in housing in the scope of social inclusion over the 2021—2027 programming period. In addition, several other investments, such as support for energy efficiency in housing, which amounts to around EUR 6.2 billion, are also expected to have a positive impact on housing. More generally, the Commission has been promoting better housing policies in Member States, including in the context of the European Semester. We monitor housing policies in the European Semester and look at affordability, availability and quality of housing when we propose country—specific recommendations. Indeed, several Member States have received recommendations on this. We need to be accountable, and that is why we are also investing in better analysis and better monitoring of policies, including at city level, with the first coordinated homelessness count organised in different cities in Europe this year as a pilot project sponsored by this Parliament. The European Commission will continue to work on different fronts to support the Member States and other actors involved in combating homelessness across the EU.",-,2024-02-07,20.

Helena Dalli,"Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for this debate. The latest cycle of violence in central Plateau State reached a tragic peak, as we have been hearing, on 24 December, resulting yet again in too many innocent victims and wanton destruction. The security steps taken, the commitment from highest levels, the peace walk of the governor with Christian and Muslim leaders have sadly been insufficient to stop the violence. Two weeks ago, the state governor had to impose a curfew in violence-affected areas. These are, of course, very concerning developments within a generally worsening security context. Recent research has found a 730 % increase in bandit attacks between 2018 and 2022 in northern Nigeria. The causes, as ever, are complex. No single factor can explain the violence. There is a history of conflict in Plateau State which has fed on ethno-religious differences. But we should not forget that 80 % of the population in this area is poor, highly dependent on subsistence farming and cattle breeding. They are significantly affected by climate change and desertification. Sedentary farmers and mobile cattle breeders face conflicts over land. Land ownership and grazing areas are poorly regulated, and significant demographic growth adds to the strain on natural resources. Therefore, security measures should not be the only answer. Grassroots initiatives for conflict prevention and resolution, promoting inter- and intra-religious coexistence and the management of natural resources are all important as well. The EU offers support in these areas of work, including in Plateau State. The EU human rights strategy for Nigeria includes freedom of religion and belief as a priority, and the EU addressed this issue with Nigeria in the Human Rights Dialogue last year. Governance, peace and security have always been a priority and, conscious of Nigeria’s role in the region and on the continent, we have strengthened our political partnership to address these challenges. We carefully follow the new government’s plans for improving security, conflict prevention and resolution and stand ready to provide further support, all to help ensure peace, tolerance and coexistence among religious and ethnic communities. Freedom of religion and belief is addressed with the Nigerian authorities through the EU’s annual Human Rights Dialogue and is a distinct priority in the EU human rights strategy for Nigeria. Two projects were launched in 2022 to promote inter- and inter-religious peaceful coexistence in Plateau State and other states, through increased and structured engagement of local faith partners and communities. The EU Special Envoy for Freedom of Religion and Belief is currently considering a visit to Nigeria in the coming months, and the EU High Representative expressed his dismay at targeted attacks against Christians, for instance when scores of churchgoers were massacred in Ondo State in June 2022. So the European Union has advocated for speedy criminal justice responses while continuing to stand ready to support Nigeria in achieving lasting peace and stability.",-,2024-02-07,19.3.

There is no doubt that there is jihadi violence; nobody denies that. However, we need to look at the deeper symptoms of it, and the deeper symptoms of it are poor governance, corruption and the absence of the rule of law.

Well, was it a coincidence that the slaughter and burning of churches took place on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, I wonder? Fact: 90 % of Christian martyrs are Nigerian.

Helena Dalli,"Mr President, as repeatedly said, also in this chamber, the human rights situation in Belarus has been rapidly and drastically deteriorating. The recent searches, repression and arrests of family members, of political prisoners, are the latest demonstrations of Lukashenka’s disregard for rule of law, democracy and fundamental freedoms. The EU firmly reacts to these developments with public statements, sanctions, solidarity with political prisoners and their families, and by supporting the work on accountability. We continue to call on the regime to immediately and unconditionally release all political prisoners. In his latest statement on 25 January, the High Representative condemned this new wave of repressions and the detention of over 200 people, mostly women, relatives of political prisoners. There are nearly 1 500 political prisoners currently detained in Belarus, many of them kept incommunicado for weeks, months and even years, many without access to legal representation and appropriate medical care, deprived of their fundamental rights and submitted to ill treatment or torture. The EU has introduced restrictive measures against the perpetrators of human rights violations, judges, prosecutors, heads of penal colonies and members of the regime’s security services. We are committed to work on further listings. We are mobilising all tools to address the situation of political prisoners. The EU delegation in Minsk regularly requests information from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus and on the conditions of prominent political prisoners kept incommunicado. We also ask to visit political prisoners, however, to no avail. The minimum we can do is to continue showing our solidarity with political prisoners, notably by standing in front of courts during their trials.

Helena Dalli,"Mr President, the European Union has a strong, unequivocal and long-standing opposition to the death penalty at all times and in all circumstances. The EU always raises human rights issues and human rights cases and its official interactions with Iran, including by raising specific cases. Death penalty is an ultimate denial of human dignity, which fails to act as a deterrent to crime and makes miscarriage of justice irreversible. We do not shy away, as I said, from expressing our condemnation and our position publicly and in private, in any country where the death penalty is used. This includes the widespread use of the death penalty in Iran, which we regularly address in our direct exchanges with the Iranian authorities as part of the EU’s comprehensive policy approach towards the country. The EU has publicly condemned Iran’s recent execution of Mohammad Ghobadlou after being arrested and sentenced to death in connection with the 2022 protests in Iran. This latest execution is part of an alarming trend in Iran, with more than 750 executions in 2023, representing a sharp increase from previous years, and including, in particular, individuals from ethnic minorities. The use of the death penalty as a tool of repression against protesters is yet another reminder of the deterioration of human rights in Iran. Fundamental rights such as freedom of opinion and expression must always be respected. Both privately and publicly, we continue to urge Iran to uphold its international obligations under international law, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Iran must guarantee the full range of fundamental rights for their citizens, irrespective of religion, belief or any other status. In line with its firmly established stance in multilateral fora, including the UN, the EU will spare no effort to urge Iran to pursue a consistent policy towards the abolition of the death penalty altogether. It is also imperative for the Iranian authorities to uphold the accused individuals’ due process rights and ensure that those who are under any form of detention or imprisonment are not subject to any form of mistreatment.",-,2024-02-07,"19.2.

One of the protesters was also Mohammad Ghobadlou. This was enough for the Iranian regime to execute him over the death of a local official during mass demonstrations. The death sentence was preceded by unfair trials marked by torture and abuse of his mental condition. The death sentence was preceded, as I said, and he is one of at least 54 people who have been executed during the last month. Iran must cease these inhuman practices and release all those on death row, as well as other political prisoners. Among them are also EU nationals Ahmad Reza Djalali and Johan Floderus.

The EU need to support this resistance. How? By blacklisting the IRGC, the regime’s instrument of oppression. The regime recently executed Mohammad Ghobadlou, a courageous young Iranian man.

The current situation in Iran underscores the moral imperative for the international community to support Iranian people in their struggle against tyranny. It is crucial to recognise and uphold their rights to seek freedom, justice and democratic government as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Helena Dalli,"Mr President, honourable Members, dear Robert, the 68th session of the Commission on the Status of Women is an occasion to reflect on key challenges and opportunities for gender equality globally, and the empowerment of all women and girls. Gender equality and women’s rights constitute a key priority for the EU in its internal and external relations. I therefore thank you for inviting me to discuss this topic. I stress the importance of our institutional cooperation, including through exchanges at all levels. Our preparations for the upcoming session of the Commission on the Status of Women also draws from the work done by the European Parliament, of course, and I am happy that we strengthen our cooperation with the presence of the European Parliament at the CSW meeting. A strong, coordinated approach among all of the EU institutions, both in presence and in content, bolsters the EU’s leadership on gender equality and contributes to advancing women’s rights and empowerment worldwide. The CSW’s main theme on economic structures to combat poverty among women allows to stress once again the need to address the root causes that constrain women’s economic empowerment, while paying attention to the multidimensional and intersectional forms of inequality. So I will highlight some of our key instruments. The European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan and the EU Gender Equality Strategy include concrete legislative and policy initiatives for women’s empowerment and addressing vulnerability. Increasing employment rates and the formal economy is vital. In this respect, the action plan includes a sub target to at least half the gender employment gap. Progress is measured as part of the European Semester. The gender-care gap significantly hinders women’s active participation in the labour market. Hence this increases their risks to poverty, including in old age. To tackle this, the Work Life Balance Directive promotes the reconciliation of work with care responsibilities for both women and men. Furthermore, the European Care Strategy promotes affordable, accessible and high quality care services, including through the revised Barcelona Targets for Early Childhood Education and Care. The recommendation on minimum income and on social protection for all supports women’s resilience. And the Pay Transparency Directive promotes equal pay for equal work of equal value and values women’s contribution on the labour market. Next to those measures, efforts to increase women’s empowerment should also address specific barriers for women facing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination. As an example, women with disabilities and the Disability Employment Package provide supportive measures specifically designed to enhance the employment opportunities for women with disabilities. Equally, the Action Plan on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment in External Action aims at bridging the gap towards the realisation of SDG 5 and alleviating women’s poverty. It takes a gender transformative, intersectional and human-rights based approach. GAP III includes an ambitious target to ensure that at least 85 % of all new EU external actions are gender responsive by 2025. The inequality marker aims to reduce inequality in all its intersections by assessing whether and to what extent our support to international partners contributes to curb inequalities. The EU has invested in the implementation and enforcement of GAP III. The EU Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security and the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy through programmes funding human-rights dialogues and activities in multilateral fora. I also underline the importance of continued efforts to strengthen gender mainstreaming to ensure that gender equality is integrated in all aspects of the Union’s activities. EU funding is an effective tool to promote our policy objectives. Catering for gender mainstreaming in the EU budget is therefore crucial to further advance gender equality. The Multiannual Financial Framework serves as a notable example. The Commission has developed a methodology to track the contribution of all EU spending programmes to gender equality, which was implemented in a pilot phase in the last two draft budgets, and was also included again in this year’s work on the upcoming draft budgets.",-,2024-02-07,15.

Paul Tang,"Mr President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, today’s discussion precedes a vote on an important bill, which could be a good starting point for future data sharing frameworks. Europe’s internal borders do not stop criminals, but our internal borders pose big hurdles to our police forces when coordinating with their peers. The Prüm II router will increase efficiency of cooperation and this is very, very welcome. No longer will law enforcement agencies have to contact each of their 26 peers individually. Of course, cooperation in the form of sharing sensitive data cross-border must be limited to what is strictly necessary and must respect fundamental rights of data subjects. That is why I am happy with the achieved trilogue result. It strikes the right delicate balance between law enforcement needs and the protection of fundamental rights. Among other things, we oblige ex-ante data impact assessment by national data protection authorities before the connection of national databases to the Prüm router. And this addresses the issue of corrupted databases with biometric data of innocent people like we have seen in France and Slovenia. We have agreed on mandatory human intervention by biometric experts before sharing of biometric data, ensuring no automated exchange is possible, and we require continuous monitoring of false positives and adequate measures to address them. This is essential in our fight in addressing the problems that may occur with real time facial recognition in the public space. Our dedication to fundamental rights, protection and accountability of law enforcement forces is evident in this agreement. I would like to express my deep appreciation to the rapporteur, Paolo Ansell, to the shadow, Fabienne Keller – she’s there – and her teams, and of course the S&D teams.

Cristian Terheş,"Madam President, Commissioner, President, dear colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, the ‘This is Europe’ debates held in the European Parliament are a great opportunity for European political leaders to express their vision about the current and future course of Europe. I congratulate, therefore, the Romanian President, Klaus Iohannis, for sharing his vision about Europe and emphasising the importance of Romania for the European project. But since the debate is about Europe, before we talk about what Europe is, it is imperative to look back and see what Europe was, how this project started, where it is heading, and if this new direction has anything in common with the initial project. When Ms von der Leyen held her speech in this plenary in 2019, she said that the European project is based ‘on Roman law and Greek philosophy’. She forgot one, and the most important pillar of the European project, the Judeo-Christian values, civilisation and culture. It was the Christian belief and Judeo-Christian values, based on the Bible, that gave the power and motivation to many political leaders from different European nations that killed, destroyed and decimated each other during the Second World War to meet after the war, pray together, forgive and reconcile with each other, and come up with an economical and political plan that would and did bring peace through prosperity. Because of these visionary, faithful and courageous political leaders, Western Europe was able to achieve peace and hold it for over 80 years, which was unprecedented for Europe. I say ‘Western Europe’ because, us in Eastern Europe were under the Soviet occupation and we experienced a different kind of political and economic system, an atheistic one, in which the state and the Communist Party were God, where the state was above all and people were deprived of their basic fundamental rights. The difference between the two political and economic systems that Europe experienced after the Second World War – the European project that we witness here, which evolved in the European Community and Union in Western Europe, and the USSR and the Soviet Marxist and communist model in Eastern Europe – is exactly the pillar that was intentionally or not forgotten by Ursula von der Leyen: the Judeo-Christian values, culture and civilisation. The Judeo-Christian values are the source of and notions that later evolved and were mentioned in international treaties, national constitutions and laws like human dignity, equality before the law, the separation of powers in the state or inalienable fundamental human rights. Robert Schuman, a founding father of the European Project and former President of the European Parliament, said, ‘Democracy owes its existence to Christianity [...] Christianity teaches equality of all nature of all men, children of the same God, redeemed by the same Christ, without distinction of race, colour, class or profession [...] Democracy will be Christian or it won’t exist. An unchristian democracy is a caricature which sinks into tyranny or anarchy.’ It was exactly these Judeo-Christian values that brought peace, prosperity, respect among nations in Western Europe, and the lack of them that brought tyranny, abuse and poverty in the USSR, in Eastern Europe. It was this faith in God that my fellow Romanians held strong under communism and motivated them to dream and fight for freedom. It is therefore incomprehensible for many fellow Romanians why in the past 40 years exactly these personal and national freedoms have been violated by the European Commission under Ursula von der Leyen. The European project was built on a free market principle which was brought, which has brought prosperity in Western Europe. In the past four years, under the current European Commission, we see that free market principles are becoming an overregulated one, which is making the European businesses and products less likely to be competitive on the global market. The European project was built on the concept that fundamental human rights are inalienable, and the governments must not force or impose medical products into citizens bodies, but allowed them to decide based on their free and informed consent. We saw what happened during the pandemic, when people were forced to be vaccinated with medical products that we find out now, later on, have many adverse effects. Europe has long been a reference of democracy and human rights, championing principles of liberty, equality and the rule of law. An erosion of these fundamental rights, even by EU entities, represents a betrayal of our shared values and must be met with firm opposition. The Romanian nation, which I most proudly represent, was able to overcome any challenges during history and become today one of the fastest growing economies in Europe. We did it through faith and fight for freedom.",ECR,2024-02-07,"6.

Clare Daly,"Mr President, our media and our social media is awash with hate speech and disinformation. Israeli officials are on air and online every day, spewing out the vilest, most despicable hate speech. Silicon Valley tech investors and the Israeli Government conspire in WhatsApp groups to shut down pro-Palestine voices online, and to work their contacts to set online narrative for Israel. But, of course, the Commission is not talking about the responsibility of platforms or the responsibility of anyone to do anything about any of that. Hate speech, interference: it’s only a problem when our lords and masters say that it’s a problem. The Israelis have called for targeting the entire Gaza population and are causing severe epidemics to break out. They’ve called Palestinians ‘human animals’. The children shouldn’t be there. This is hate speech. It’s disinformation and there’s pages of it. It spews out unchecked on all channels daily. And it has incited a genocide – a genocide that the Commission, the Council and a large majority in this Parliament are all in lockstep behind.

Christel Schaldemose,"Mr President, in a few months, all the European citizens will go to the voting room and vote in the European Parliament elections. Dear Commissioner Breton, do not let Putin’s internet trolls steal the vote. When social platforms emerged, we were hopeful that they would be a place to connect people across the world. How exciting! We hoped that these new platforms would create new room for democracy, places where people of all kinds shared their thoughts and came together in a greater understanding. Now I often wonder if the technology simply brings out the worst in people. Fuelled by conflict—loving algorithms, hate speech and disinformation are spreading like wildfire. It is threatening our mental well-being, it is threatening our democracy and it is endangering our fundamental rights. As such, we need a structural solution to these threats. That is why we made the Digital Services Act two years ago, to hold big tech responsible for the spread of hate speech and disinformation on their platforms. I am so proud of that law. We obliged the platforms to do risk assessments, to counteract disinformation and to stop illegal content. The DSA is adopted, the tools are here and the very large online platforms are identified. Now we need to see the law in action. Everybody has to do their part. The Member States needs to assign the digital services coordinators, and they must provide adequate resources. They do play a crucial role in enforcing the DSA on national level. The Commission needs to open up investigations when there are signs that social platforms are breaching the DSA rules. Breaches of the rules should be punished and the rules should be enforced thoroughly. The big tech companies need to live up to their obligations under the DSA; they have to adapt their business model to serve democracy, not to undermine it. Going into the European elections this year, these responsibilities are more important than ever. The European Parliament elections will be the first stress test of the DSA. Now it has to prove its worth. Now all parties to the DSA have to prove their worth. We count on you in the European Commission, Commissioner Breton. We count on the Member States, and we also count on the big tech companies to do their part.

Klaus Iohannis,"Madam President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, thank you very much. This is a privilege for me to speak to you here in the centre of European democracy. Thank you for your very positive feedback. I thank the speakers of the political groups for their positions, and I appreciate very much the positive and constructive approach in all the views expressed here. But let me thank you specifically for one issue, most of all mentioned, which is the Schengen issue. Romania is a very determined, a very strong and a very faithful member of the Union. We really believe that the Union has to be united, strong, secure, prosperous. To make this happen, we have to finish the European integration of all the Member States, including Romania. So let’s hope that we make the decisive step. We have the first step in place. It is a good sign, and let’s continue. There have been then some issues and – I think you agree – it would go too far if I answered each and every question. So let me just point out a relatively small number of issues, and I think you expect me to be honest on these things. So I’ll try to be short and honest. When I ran for president in 2014, for the first time, I promised to the Romanians a couple of things. I’m not a great speaker, and I am not excelling in promises, so I said I will keep Romania firm on the European track, on the transatlantic track. I will see about the economy as far as the president can do this to bring more prosperity. But one important issue, which was very dear to me – I promised to strengthen the rule of law, which I did. We have less corruption. We have an independent judiciary. And this is not what I say – it is what the Commission says and what you said because you accepted the Commission’s report on the so-called CVM. And one important issue was not only to have an independent judiciary, a strong prosecution – it was also important to have independent regulators. Well, I heard that one regulator had an issue with one business, and as everywhere in a democracy and the rule of law, people, if they feel that decision was not so good, go before a judge. This is what happened, and the judges decided that the decision was correct. This is what I understand if we speak about the rule of law: everybody has the same right. Everybody has the right to a fair trial, and everybody has to accept the result. Now, many of you asked more or less precisely what I believe should happen in the European Union. I stated a number of issues in my opening remarks, but if it comes to it, what should we do with the Union to make it function better? Where are the problems? Where are the real problems? Where are the systemic problems and what can be done? Well, some systemic problems and some important issues have been discussed in this House, on our streets, in the marketplaces, and in convenings. I think you just finished before I arrived a discussion about the common European agricultural policy. That’s an issue. We have a decision on this as of 2020, four years ago. So obviously, people ask me and I ask others, ‘Why did it take us four years and huge European protests to rethink some issues of the common agricultural policy?’ Maybe it could have happened faster. We are talking about the environment, about climate change. That’s all correct. Personally, I’m very much involved in these issues. I am really convinced that we have to fight climate change, and I believe that we have to protect our environment, and we can do it. We proved it. We proved it in Romania, and we have a good policy in this respect. But we have to do more. Now we have the Green Deal, which is super. But let me tell you, if it is not sustainable and if it does not lead to economic growth, and if we do not take everybody with us, it will be a failure. So, bref, elections upcoming – most of you are probably running for new mandate. That’s fine. Not me, I’m finished. At the end of this year, I finish my mandate and that’s it. So I believe that three things should be changed or should be improved. First, our relationship with the European citizens. My impression – maybe I’m wrong – is that if the citizens are here, we are here. We are levitating a bit high. Maybe we should decrease and be closer to our citizens, because what we do is correct but we lost, almost lost, our ability to explain this to our people. We are not really performing well when it comes to communicating our very good results. We are doing a super job and more and more Europeans believe the Union is failing. Well, this is about communication: communication between the voters and the politicians. So this is one issue where I believe we can and should do more and better. Second, some of you asked about decision-making. It is about the architecture of the Union. How do we make it better? And we have to improve it, because if we take in Ukraine, Moldova and the Western Balkans, we will be a large Union, and this decision-making, especially in crisis, war, pandemic and energy crisis, has to be correct, transparent but fast. So I believe that we have to work on our architecture. Some of it may be possible to change without opening the Treaties, but some issues have to be changed in the Treaties. They are not perfect. Since we have these Treaties – I hope you don’t mind me telling you – years have passed. We are a different Union and we work towards a different Union. I hope very much you agree: we work towards a better Union, so let’s work on this. At least one issue – and you will know what I mention – it is not acceptable that one member is using a veto to stop all of us helping others. So if we’re not in a position yet to generalise a qualified majority voting, which may be defined different than it is now, not talking about the details, but at least we should have the courage to say ‘no veto’ and let’s take it out of the decision-making process. That’s something very concrete we should do. Finally, our external image, well, I believe we have to be much better here. First, we have to integrate those who want to be with us and those we want to be with us: Ukraine, Moldova, Western Balkans. They try to become part of the Union, some of them for 20 years. I mean, are we serious? Are we? Do we want them? If we do, let’s go. If not, let’s say to them ‘no’. But dragging on, you know very well, never makes things better. Somehow linked to this is how we act towards others. It is what we call foreign policy. Well, guess what? We don’t have one. This is strange, isn’t it? We have as many foreign policies as we have Member States, and maybe even more. Thanks, you’re right. Maybe this is the reason why our foreign policy weight is way, way, way smaller than our economic weight. This is not good for us because economic policy and foreign policy have to go hand in hand. So we should work on these two: extension and foreign policy. Now, the elections are upcoming. Each of you is going to fight for a seat or a principle or a value. That’s correct. Every party comes up with concepts, with ideas, with policies. You will accuse each other of being, well, the wrong guys. You will fight for as many votes as possible. That’s absolutely fair. That’s the essence of democracy: campaigning, profiling, trying to be the best. Please do so. You sitting here are the best. This is why you sit here. But please, if you fight each other, don’t fight Europe. If you fight for votes against your opponents, still fight for European Union. And if you fight with the other party and tell them they are not the right guys, please do not fight against the European solidarity. Because without this we are doomed. So no matter who is winning – and I hope the best are winning – let us uphold our values, our principles, our unity, and our solidarity.",-,2024-02-07,"6.

Together, we have managed over recent years to create the biggest package of economic support after the pandemic. You always advocated for strong support for Ukraine. You led the efforts of supporting the Republic of Moldova, and you helped Europe understand that we are only safe if our neighbouring countries are safe. Looking ahead, our common task is to defend Europe. Europe means security. Europe means prosperity, democracy, rule of law, and Europe means stability.

I would love to hear an answer on that. And then second, we have a great moment of European democracy coming up with the European elections.

Clare Daly,"Madam President and President, I listened very carefully to your opening remarks. And for me, I think, Romania is one of the most interesting European countries. I think the Romanian people are pretty much like the Irish people, in my experience, in terms of their approach to life. I spent a month in Timişoara and Bucharest in the spring of 1990 as a student leader from Ireland, and learned so much about the hopes and aspirations of Romanian citizens in the post-Ceauşescu years. And I think against that backdrop, for me, it’s quite unfortunate to see that, since joining the EU, so many Romanian people have been forced to leave the country or been hoovered up by Western Europe as a sort of pool of cheap labour, rather than having the opportunities that they should have had at home. I’m sorry to see that you ended up joining NATO and that you’re spending so much of your defence money on things that really should be spent on making people’s lives better. And I am sorry to see cases such as the one highlighted by my colleague about the very, very serious problems and questions that remain to be answered regarding the operation of the Romanian regulator, the ASF, because of the consequential impact not just on your own drivers, but also across the EU motor insurance sector. And I, too, am one of the Members of this House who for many months now have been raising questions about that regulator’s decision to withdraw the licence to Euroins Romania, which is obviously part of the largest independent insurance group in central, eastern and south-eastern Europe. Now, I know you know about that case, Mr President – and not just because my colleague raised it – but it is beyond curious that the Romanian regulator acted against this company three years after requesting them to take over City Insurance. Why did they do this? It is a fact that both the Bulgarian financial regulator and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development queried what your regulator was up to. Both of them approached the European authorities. One of the organisations produced a report cautioning against the consequences of this. They even produced a resolution proposal which would have mitigated the impacts, but nothing happened. And your country faces exposure to a EUR 500 million lawsuit, not to mention the broader impact beyond. Having brought this to the attention of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, who are supposed to mitigate these issues but who have failed to produce the report for Members of this Parliament – it’s been withheld from us – I’m deeply concerned about the security around this case. So I suppose my question, Mr President, is really quite a simple one. In the interests of the citizens of Romania and beyond, would you join us in supporting our call to the European Commission to initiate a comprehensive and independent review of this case?",The Left,2024-02-07,"6.

Gunnar Beck,"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, Your Excellency, Romania’s motor insurance industry has been in turmoil in recent years: 12 companies providing motor insurance have been driven out of business in just 12 years. A total of 12 insurance fails in 12 years should raise serious concerns about the regulatory environment in the Member State. In 2019, the Romanian insurance regulator ASF asked Euroins Romania to buy the then-failing City Insurance. Just three years later, ASF suspended Euroins’ insurance license in Romania, apparently for questionable reasons. This was Romania’s last motor insurer gone. Last year, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development raised questions with the Romanian Finance Minister about the actions of ASF and submitted a resolution proposal to your predecessor to the effect. The European insurance watchdog, EIOPA, wrote a report about the Euroins affair. In a reply to my written question, the Commission claims it never saw the report. To date, I’m denied access to the full details of the EIOPA report. What are ASF and EIOPA trying to hide from the Commission and Members of Parliament? One observation following the decision to strip Euroins of its licence: ASF awarded a licence to Eazy Asigurări, a subsidiary of Superbet. And who’s the chairman of Superbet? One of Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s brothers. Your Excellency, Romania is one of the largest net recipients of EU money. You are receiving EUR 10 billion from the European budget and the NextGenerationEU fund.

Manfred Weber,"Madam President, Commissioner Šefčovič, President Iohannis, it is good to have you in the European Parliament. Welcome. I want to start with a quote: ‘We cannot ignore the challenges we face on the eastern flank. Security and defence are fundamental components of the Union’s future’. These, Mr President, are your words from the Munich Security Conference in 2019. I was in the audience. You were right then, and you are right now. The war in Ukraine has been a wake—up call for many, but not for you. When you entered into office in 2014, you said that defence was one of the priorities for Romania and for Europe. In 2017, you managed to get the Romanian Parliament to increase defence spending to meet the NATO 2% commitment, and in 2023, Romania committed to spend 2.5% of its GDP for defence. It is your determination that made Romania a strong pillar of European defence and one of Ukraine’s greatest allies. This is leadership at its best – not speaking about problems, but solving them. Dear President Iohannis, when we look at Romania today, we see a true European success story. Since joining the European Union in 2007, Romania has become Eastern Europe’s second—largest economy at an impressive speed, and a modern, attractive country. Bucharest is number one in the Balkans for building up start-ups; Cluj—Napoca is a true European tech hub. This is a country full of talent that is fighting to turn brain drain into brain gain. Great leaders are not only great at the national level, but they are also great on European level. You also reminded us that in the Sibiu EU summit in 2019 – the first EU summit to be held on Europe Day – you got all leaders to agree on a Europe that protects its citizens. You have advanced many EU defence initiatives, always working for a strong EU pillar in a strong NATO. You started many strategic discussions on enlargement, and it was also your strong voice in the European Council that made it possible to open the accession talks with Ukraine and Moldova last December. Europe owes a lot to Romanian leadership and Romania owes a lot to your leadership. You showed Romanian citizens that a modern, pro-European Romania is possible and is successful. I also want to thank the Romanian Commissioner and all Romanian colleagues in the plenary who also served this broader perspective. Dear President Iohannis, for us in the EPP there is no doubt that Romania must fully join the Schengen Area. You have been ready for 13 years on this subject. If planes and ships are crossing borders without inspection, why should cars and trucks have to wait in endless lines? Romania and Bulgaria must mean Schengen. It’s good for security, it’s good for the business, and it’s good for our citizens. In the middle of the Brexit crisis in 2019, the spirit of Sibiu was fresh air to relaunch Europe. Now, five years later – if I may say this from an EP point of view – the EP family will go to Bucharest for the congress. We will go to Romania to kick off our campaign and to kick off the campaign for the European elections. Once again, Romania is the place to shape a safer home for all Europeans.

Frances Fitzgerald,"Mr President, Commissioner and minister, the Digital Services Act has been crucial in making the digital transition one that respects the law and fundamental rights that we uphold in the non-digital world. This is all the more important in a time of increasing conflict around the globe and, indeed, as so many colleagues have said, with so many elections this year – at least 70 around the world. We’ve all seen the impact of the rise in hate speech and disinformation online; parents worried about whether their children are safe online. I’ve seen the enormous work done by Jackie Fox after the death of her daughter, resulting in a law called Coco’s Law in Ireland. And we now have a similar law in the Directive on violence against women. Incitement of fear and hate among communities, entire elections being decided on the basis of untrue or inaccurate information. No country allows the right to free speech override provisions on incitement to hatred. It should be no different online. There are excellent provisions but, of course, they have to be implemented. And I welcome what the Commissioner had to say today. Administrators now have to ensure that these provisions are fully implemented and enforced. The law must not only be upheld; it must be seen to be upheld.

Klaus Iohannis,"Doamnă președintă a Parlamentului European, distinși membri ai Parlamentului European, doamnelor și domnilor, este o onoare pentru mine să mă aflu astăzi în fața dumneavoastră. Vă mulțumesc, doamnă președintă Metsola, pentru că mi-ați oferit ocazia de a reveni în centrul democrației europene la începutul unui an crucial pentru viitorul Uniunii Europene. Ca și în urmă cu cinci ani, când m-am adresat plenului Parlamentului European, vreau să reafirm încrederea mea și a poporului român în valoarea acțiunii europene unite și solidare, în puterea incontestabilă a unei singure Europe. Efectele pandemiei, războiul de agresiune al Rusiei împotriva Ucrainei, conflictul din Orientul Mijlociu, toate acestea sunt numai câteva dintre evoluțiile dramatice care ne-au testat în ultimii ani nu doar capacitatea de răspuns, ci și atașamentul nostru sincer față de Uniune și față de valorile și principiile care ne țin împreună. Doamnelor și domnilor, țara mea este probabil unul dintre cele mai bune exemple ale puterii transformatoare a Uniunii Europene. Aderarea ne-a adus beneficii indiscutabile și dintre cele mai concrete. Fondurile europene intrate în România de la momentul aderării ne-au permis să realizăm proiecte esențiale de infrastructură. Peste 600 000 de tineri români au participat la programul Erasmus, însușindu-și astfel modul de viață european. Uniunea înseamnă un spațiu al siguranței, al protecției, al prosperității și al diversității. Uniunea Europeană rămâne prin excelență un spațiu al liberei circulații. Ridicarea în martie a controalelor la frontierele aeriene și maritime trebuie urmată, în mod firesc, în cel mai scurt timp, de eliminarea controalelor la frontierele terestre. Doar astfel vom avea reflectarea corectă și concretă a contribuției pe care România o aduce la consolidarea securității întregii Uniuni Europene. Doamnelor și domnilor, proiectul european necesită zi de zi atenție, efort, răbdare și onestitate, dacă vrem să trăim liberi într-o Europă unită și prosperă. România de astăzi este un promotor puternic al acțiunii coordonate în spiritul valorilor europene. Avem responsabilitatea de a susține o Europă care duce mai departe aceste principii și valori, inclusiv către prietenii noștri din vecinătatea europeană care au ales modelul nostru de democrație și dezvoltare, iar o etapă cheie a acestui proces o reprezintă chiar alegerile europene. Prioritățile pe care le vom defini împreună după aceste alegeri vor trebui să ne ajute să răspundem pragmatic la provocările prezentului și să ne pregătească mai bine pentru provocările viitorului. Distinguished Members of the European Parliament, our Union faces unprecedented geostrategic challenges. Our future and the future of the next generations depend on each and every decision we are taking now. On a global level, the rules-based international order is being challenged over and over again. Russia pursues its aggression against Ukraine. Around the Union, instability and insecurity have reached alarming levels. The open conflict in the Middle East, the situation in the Red sea and the worrying developments in the Sahel: all these have a systemic impact on our own security. Climate change, economic difficulties and illegal migration continue to generate their own negative impact, adding to the complexity of global dynamics. On top of all these challenges, we witness a crisis of values. And, as far as I see it, a crisis of public trust in our institutions. We are indeed facing an erosion of values within the European Union, which fuels the perception of decline of Europe, or at least of Europe’s leadership and global role. This is why we need to do more, to promote the feeling and the certainty that we are all part of the same community of values, which must be protected by every single one of us. Honourable Members of the European Parliament, at such a pivotal moment fundamental questions lie ahead of us. We must answer them together as Europeans with vision, courage and responsibility. First, what can we do and have to do as a Union? The current challenges are pushing us towards a transformative rethinking of our actions. The past few years proved that our common action as one, as a true Union, is key. Our unity has been repeatedly tested and has not faltered. More than this, it was a strategic surprise for some and brought us tactical advantages. We should build upon this. Second, thinking further, another crucial question emerges. What can we do more, internally? Strengthening our internal resilience is a fundamental condition for a stronger Union and for its increased geopolitical role. This is perhaps the most complex discussion. It includes finding the best strategies to respond to hybrid threats and to increase the functionality of our democratic systems. It means developing sectoral policies such as technology, including artificial intelligence, fighting climate change, stimulating competitiveness, industrial production, and sustainable supply chains. I do believe that the success of the démarches in these areas depends on a strong single market, which can provide solutions to many of the problems we face, encouraging creativity and large-scale development. We as a Union are now taking unprecedented steps to move away from a reactive approach in consolidating our internal resilience. We are taking action in terms of strengthening our internal capabilities such as infrastructure, green and digital transitions, civil crisis response, energy efficiency and supply chains. Another obvious line of action is to continue to support Ukraine. We must stand by Ukraine and its people. I have this conviction, despite certain voices invoking a European solidarity fatigue. Defending democracy, territorial integrity and sovereignty, as well as the rules-based international order, cannot be subject to any fatigue. Romania remains engaged in this common effort. We are strongly involved in supporting Ukraine as well as the Republic of Moldova, which is intensely affected by the crisis in the region. We also need to keep our focus on security. We are now moving towards a joint long-term planning and increased convergence in the field of European security and defence, while working in full complementarity with NATO. It is indeed high time to deliver on our European ambitions when it comes to our defence industry. Esteemed Members of the European Parliament, I wish to express my appreciation for the strong attachment to values that this House has always shown, but we must be aware about the growing Euroscepticism. Its adepts may raise issues that are in some part real, but they give wrong and dangerous solutions that would throw our societies into crisis. It is therefore, our common duty to be honest in our communication with the European citizens. Third, how can the Union further externalise its attractiveness? This is another key question to address when looking towards our future. How can we stay attractive as a Union? The answer is clear: enlarging our European family by accepting new members will only strengthen the Union. The historic decisions taken by the European Council last December on the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine, as well as on Bosnia and Herzegovina and on Georgia, are a victory for the entire European Union. This Parliament has been strongly supportive of this objective, and I thank you for this. Romania has – and I personally have – strongly supported and promoted it. I think that it confirms the Union’s attractiveness at the time of hardship, strengthens its geopolitical weight, and creates opportunities for Member States and candidate countries alike. Enlargement is an essential part of our strategic answer to the geopolitical developments and the key investment in lasting peace, stability and democracy in our neighbourhood. At the same time, the European Union must assume a leading global role in preserving the international order as a precondition for preserving our way of life and our values. The European Union’s economic weight must be mirrored by its international political role. The challenges we are facing are global and some of them can only be solved by promoting relationships with partners with similar values and interests. Ensuring this strategic network of resilient partnerships will make us stronger and more competitive in the long run. This is why we need to intensify our global outreach towards Africa, Asia-Pacific and Latin America, and we do need to further consolidate the transatlantic link – this is crucial for our success. Two last questions. Do we have the means to achieve our goals? Which is the way forward and what is the future of the Union? The Union has the legal and institutional instruments to achieve its goals, and the response to the pandemic and the crisis that followed is illustrative. But it is equally obvious that we need to streamline our decision-making capacity. We need to closely analyse what measures can be taken in a context where some consider that the real efficiency of decision-making mechanisms is impossible without reopening the Treaties, while others radically rule out this possibility. There is no doubt that measures such as those discussed in relation to the qualified majority voting in specific areas of foreign and security policy can be taken without reopening the Treaties. Without excluding changes to the Treaties at some point, we need to use all available possibilities under the existing Treaties for smoother and quicker decision-making. Romania is fully engaged in this exercise. Honourable Members of the European Parliament, despite the views of some, we are stronger now than five years ago. We showed remarkable unity in probably the direst circumstances we had to face as a Union. Nevertheless, we have a lot of work ahead of us. Our European common construction is, after all, work in progress. As stated by Jacques Delors, the visionary European leader whom we recently paid homage to, ‘The European model is in danger if we obliterate the principle of personal responsibility’. Therefore, dear colleagues, it is our shared responsibility to do the best for all our citizens. We have a special responsibility towards our youth. The future generations are looking towards us with hope and optimism in times of geopolitical volatility and socioeconomic distress. The future of Europe is about the capacity of the Union to give them honest answers and to deliver in education, health, prosperity, climate security and employment opportunities. Five years ago, we adopted the Sibiu Declaration. The ten commitments made back then are still valid. Unity, solidarity, cohesion, the rule of law – they continue to lie at the very core of our joint European action. For my part, I remain deeply faithful to these valuable values and principles in my future endeavours, and I am convinced that these are the basis for the work done by you here in the European Parliament as well. I also believe that together we are able to maintain the Union on the path of success, staying true to our vision of a united and stronger Europe.",-,2024-02-07,"6.

President,"Dear colleagues, we have the President of Romania, Klaus Iohannis, with us today. Dear President, dear Klaus, welcome to the European Parliament. Thank you for accepting our invitation to address this House as part of our ‘This is Europe’ series of debates. Seventeen years of European Union membership have been transformative for Romania and for Europe. It has given new impetus for businesses, for industry, for science and academia. It has brought reforms and social benefits. It has brought opportunities for people and levelled up communities. EU membership has meant protection for people’s rights, for social justice and the rule of law. And in times of geo-political change, these European values must be defended. Dear President, I would like to particularly thank you for your country’s unwavering support for Ukraine and for the Republic of Moldova – particularly now that EU accession negotiations have begun. Thank you to Romania for always being the champion the people of those nations needed. Romania has a special place in my heart. It is a country that has embraced what it means to be European. At the height of the pandemic, Romanian doctors flew to hospitals in other Member States to help. When we faced devastating natural disasters, Romanian firefighters left their country to run into the flames. In the first days of the brutal Russian invasion of Ukraine, Romanian families rushed to the border to comfort those fleeing. Mulțumesc pentru tot România! Mr President, yours is a country that has shown how to overcome challenges and how to lead. Europe is stronger thanks to Romania, thanks to your reinforcement of the EU’s eastern flank. And we will be stronger still when you finally take your rightful place in the Schengen area, and join the eurozone in the future. And you will find this House on your side on that journey. (Applause) Last word: on 9 June, over 19 million Romanians will be called upon to choose the 33 Members of the European Parliament elected to represent them. We must work together to make sure people understand why they must vote, why it is important.

I come from a small island state with slightly over 10 000 farms, 90% of which are less than two hectares in size, where agricultural land costs 22 times more than the EU average, where our insularity places even more burden to acquire resources like fertiliser that is necessary to sustain a sector, which is becoming only more economically arduous. Indeed, while environmental ambition and regulation is necessary, we need to give farmers the breathing space needed for them to transition successfully. The choice could not be clearer; we must work to guarantee the economic viability of all farmers, especially small and micro-farms.",S&D,2024-02-07,4.

Maroš Šefčovič,"Madam President, Madam Minister, honourable Members of the European Parliament, first and foremost, I would like to thank all of you for having added this key debate at the level of political leaders. And I think that this debate clearly demonstrated that our agriculture and rural communities are affected by a wide range of policies, several crises and current geopolitical tension. Therefore, I am glad that I could have participated in this debate on behalf of the European Commission. You, honourable Members, clearly highlighted how complex this issue we are going to discuss today is, especially in these challenging times for Europe and farmers. But I think what is absolutely clear also after this morning exchange is that what we need is to work better together, that we need, together, to look for constructive solutions. And I think, as Madam García Pérez mentioned early on in our discussion, farmers need EU and EU needs farmers. And I would like to ensure all of you, and especially our farmers and foresters community, that we treat them with the utmost respect and appreciation for their work and that we will continue to do so also in the future. I think that now, clearly, it’s a time to work on how can we overcome the polarisation which got into our discussion, what we can do to build bridges, and I cannot find a better place like this House to start with this process, to build the bridges, to look for the common solutions, and to have the right focus on our discussions for the future. And how to do it in the best possible way is to propose and work on concrete solutions. And many ideas have been already mentioned here today, and also, as Madam Vautmans said yesterday, in our debate with the President of the European Commission. What I kind of record and recall is that all of you called for making sure that we have to address one crucial point, and this is how to guarantee decent income for our farmers, how to make sure that those who produce in a sustainable manner, who are treating their employees decently, who respect all environmental forms, will not be undercut by unfair practices or cheap alternative imports from abroad. And that’s something what we are clearly looking at and what we want to address. Mr Mureşan, Mr Weber and many others have been calling for making sure that we will not take the decisions on agriculture without talking to the farmers, and we are doing exactly that. Therefore, we launched our strategic dialogue on the future of agriculture well in advance of the next discussion on the next seven years’ budget and next debate on the future CAP. And I believe that, through that strategic dialogue and also with your participation, we will have plenty of ideas how to structure and frame those policies better. And I agree with Mr Álvarez that we have to work with the farmers because they have to feel the ownership of this process, and this is how the structured strategic dialogue is organised. Madam Müller was referring to the importance to make sure that the strategic dialogue shouldn’t just be a top-down approach. I totally agree with her, and therefore we made sure that the participation in this discussion is wide-ranging, that we have big farmers, small farmers, young farmers, organic farmers, that we have representatives of the whole value chain, researchers, innovators, but also academics. And I very much appreciate that some of you suggested that it would be good to also discuss these issues on the regional level, and I can assure you that through the special portal which we created for this, we are ready to accommodate also the ideas coming from you, coming from regional dialogue, so they would enrich the final report which we will present to all of you by the end of summer as a result of this strategic dialogue. I also agree with you, honourable Members, that the best-quality food in the world is produced here in Europe and that our farmers are guaranteeing not only food security for all Europeans, but they also created the sector about which we are proud because it’s important part of the European economy, and we want to improve it further – because the European farmers must consolidate this important position for now and for the future. Madam Carvalhais was referring to the young farmers. I had several discussions with them and indeed, we have to find the solution to the two prevailing problems they have been highlighting to me: access to land and access to finance. If you want to have young farmers to work on the farms, we have to address these two issues, and it’s one of the topics which we are discussing together. Many of you called for better use of our regional policies to make sure that our rural areas have good schools, have good internet, have good digital and transport infrastructure, because it’s important part for our farmers to be efficient and for young farmers to be, of course, attracted into this profession, and we take it on board. We are working on it, and also with my colleague, Commissioner responsible for regional development, Madam Ferreira. We are really paying a lot of attention to this issue. I think in every intervention today was a call for reduction of bureaucracy and simplification. And again, we hear you loud and clear and we have to work again on this together. On the European level, I am glad that many of you also referred that we have to tackle the gold-plating on the national level, sometimes the specific regional problems by application of the European law. And just to make sure that we will limit the bureaucracies to the minimum. It’s clearly a priority for our Commission. Our President is paying enormous attention to this. And together with the cluster of the Green Deal Commissioners, we are working to make sure that we will also deliver on these very important priorities. I also would like to thank the honourable Members who made clear reference for tackling the unfair trade practices and proper implementation of the directive on unfair trade practices. We completely share your objective, and we are working on making sure that this would be well enforced. Currently, we are at a stage where we are assessing how this is enforced and implemented across the Member States to make sure that it’s uniform, it’s working, it delivers, and of course it brings the results which we need to remove unfair trade practices from agriculture. There was also quite a lot of intervention focused on the ongoing negotiations on the trade agreements. And here again, I would like to be clear and following this debate, I would like to confirm that the Commission assessment is that the conditions for the conclusion of the Mercosur agreement are not met. And to conclude, Madam President – and thank you very much for your indulgence, but the debate was very, very long, and I wanted to respond to as many inquiries as possible – I would like to conclude by reassuring you that we in the Commission feel the sense of urgency, and we act. The strategic dialogue and intensive interaction with our farmers community is ongoing. And if you ask about the concrete steps, just look at the last weeks. I would just recall our proposal on the partial derogation of GAEC 8, which is on the leaving land fallow obligation, where we work with flexibilities. And I believe that together with the Belgian presidency, we will find a good solution for our farmers. The same applies to the agricultural imports from Ukraine, where we do our utmost to make sure that Ukrainian exports will go to the original destinations in the third countries. And if that would not be possible, that we will protect our farmers where and when necessary. And the last word, Madam President, honourable Members, I would recall again, and if you allow me to pass it through our honourable Members to our farmers community. So, dear farmers, we respect you. We value your work, and I believe that we will overcome these challenges which are ahead of us today together.",-,2024-02-07,4.

Tilly Metz,"Madam President, dear Commissioner, our food system is broken: multinationals are making billions while farmers struggle to make ends meet; extremely low prices; family farms disappearing every day. We are in an agricultural crisis. To the farmers protesting outside: we are not your enemy. We Greens know that without farmers there is no food and that farmers deserve to make a decent living. We all also know that without nature there is no farming. What has led to this crisis are the policies pushed by the very people who like to blame us Greens: more and more free trade agreements, an unfair common agricultural policy, and simply not enough support to help farmers through the transition. Here is what we need to do: stop unfair competition from imported food; break the power of big corporations; more support to small farmers; less bureaucracy.

Chris MacManus,"Mr President, Mr Vice-President, Madam Commissioner, I want to express solidarity with family farmers who are feeling the pain of inflation, fuel costs, competitions with imports from outside the EU, and general lack of fair prices. These mounting challenges – while they’re being asked to do more – has reached a breaking point for many who are more concerned than ever for their family farms’ future. This was evident in the anger seen last week, but these protests did not happen in isolation: many of our farmers feel abandoned, many have lost faith in the system, a system that has burdened them with unfair free trade agreements they can’t compete with. And as rural custodians, they are expected to carry a large share of green initiatives like the Nature Restoration Law. They must be duly compensated for such efforts, and concerns such as forest re-wetting must be listened to, and I call on the Irish Government in any future national restoration plan to commit to such issues.",The Left,2024-02-07,4.

Luke Ming Flanagan,"Mr President, farmers are protesting because, from their perspective, the just transition is just empty words. They are being required to meet ever-higher standards, as they should, and more needs to be done. However, their livelihoods are being undermined by imports from third countries that do not meet the same standards. In Ireland, the most sustainable producers of beef, the suckler farmers, are being paid to reduce their stock while we import beef from South America, which is the other end of the rainbow when it comes to sustainability. Commissioner, you talk about help with sustainability while incentivising the destruction of a sustainable beef production model. The hypocrisy of those supposedly supporting the farmers needs to be called out. The centrist and right wing groups in the European Parliament, now extolling the virtues of the farming community, are the same people who drove the trade liberalisation agenda that has brought us to this point. Every trade deal that further undermine the position of the food producer in the EU was enthusiastically supported by and championed by you. Finally, you are wrong, Manfred Weber – farmers can’t depend on you. On your watch, food has been reduced to a commodity to be traded around the world and exploited for profit by multinationals instead of being valued as an essential human right. Those who produce it should be respected for their work, and ... (The President cut off the speaker)",The Left,2024-02-07,4.

Siegfried Mureşan,"Mr President, dear colleagues, one of the greatest achievements of European integration is the quality of food in Europe. People in Europe trust food quality, they trust food safety, and at the centre of this success is the European farmer. This is why we have the duty to listen to farmers in Europe, this is why we have the duty to support and to protect them. Of course, agriculture in Europe is modernising, agriculture in Europe has to modernise and to reform, as has every sector of our economy, as every part of our society. But we have to say clearly, ‘we are modernising agriculture with the farmers, not against the farmers’. My political family, the EPP, is ready to work with the majority here in Parliament to do the following seven things for farmers and agriculture. Firstly, no decision on agriculture without listening to farmers. Secondly, no decision without knowing the impact, and if there is any additional burden for the farmers, we have to be ready to provide more support. Thirdly, reducing bureaucracy for farmers: they have to farm more than they report. Fourthly, secure the quality and the quantity of food production in Europe: we have to produce more food in Europe, not less. Number five, invest in the rural areas as a whole: we want good schools, good hospitals. We are ready to invest in digitisation, in greening, but also in infrastructure in the rural areas, in the villages. Number six: help in times of crisis: if there is a crisis, we have to mobilise the European tools that we have, including crisis reserves, providing financial support. Number seven, help Ukraine, help Ukrainian farmers by also helping our farmers: absorb what we can in Europe, help Ukraine to export the other quantities to the other markets in the world where they are needed. We are ready to work with the majority in this House to achieve this for the farmers in Europe.",PPE,2024-02-07,4.

Paulo Rangel,"Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, the new Prüm tool will contribute to the Union’s internal security by simplifying and speeding up the exchange of criminal information between law enforcement authorities and expanding the data categories that can be exchanged. The existence of common rules harmonising these exchanges will provide predictability to all users, as everyone knows what data they would obtain at each stage. The new system will also provide simplified and faster means for authorities to search for missing persons where time is a matter of life and death. Furthermore, it will allow for the identification of human remains, this is of essence for the families of the missing who have a right to know the fate and whereabouts of their loved ones – a right recognised by international humanitarian law. The new Prüm will also include Europol, as you mentioned, Commissioner, boosting the cooperation between the agency and Member States within the scope of the powers conferred to these agency. Colleagues, Schengen and the right to move freely is one of the European Union’s greatest achievements since its foundation. Effective police cooperation is a key pillar to ensure its functioning and the security of our citizens. With modernised Prüm exchanges, we will allow law enforcement authorities to work faster and more efficiently when fulfilling their mission of fighting crime and protecting citizens, whilst ensuring the highest standards on the protection of personal data and human rights. Exchanging criminal information is fundamental to ensure timely responses – not just to find criminals, but also, in a wider sense, to guarantee to our citizens the right to freedom and the right to fair justice.",PPE,2024-02-07,14.

As the Council pointed out on 1 February, the Common Agricultural Policy has an essential role to play. However, the rules adopted in 2021 to reform the CAP need to be reassessed in the light of current realities. Ces règles ont été présentées avant la COVID-19 et avant la guerre en Ukraine. Il convient donc de les mettre à jour et de trouver un juste équilibre avec les objectifs fondamentaux de notre politique agricole, à savoir assurer la sécurité alimentaire et la juste rémunération des agriculteurs.

Kim Van Sparrentak,"Mr President, how do big platforms make money? Well, they sell ads, or rather, they do everything they can to keep us all glued to our screens for as long as possible so that they can sell more ads and keep their shareholders and investors happy. They use multiple addictive design tools to do so, but their main money-maker is their hyper—personalised algorithm, based on clicks, interaction and tracking. You might ask why this algorithm is addictive. Well, it shows you content that agitates you, content that makes you feel emotional and angry. Every time you scroll down, you will see something that gives excitement to your brain. In short, big tech algorithms are designed to show you extreme content; middle—ground content where people have a middle—of—the—road opinion simply doesn’t do the trick. This is where big tech companies are shaking the hands of Putin’s disinformation tactics and far right campaigns. These algorithms are rapidly pushing people, and especially youngsters, into extreme content and far right or misogynist posts. We see a rise in hate, both online and offline, against activists, women, the queer community and journalists, and we see more and more distrust in democratic institutions. With the EU elections upcoming, the EU can no longer be naive. We urgently need action to protect our democracies. That’s why I call on you, Commissioner, to make sure these platforms turn off these polarising algorithms, either with an update to the code of conduct or with a crisis measure, because our democracy and these elections are too important to be based on what makes the most profit for big tech companies.

Maroš Šefčovič,"Mr President, Madam Minister, honourable Members, good morning to you all. We can be rightly proud of the crucial role played by Europe’s agri-food sector, guaranteeing food security, safety and quality not only for 450 million Europeans but for many others around the world, quite literally putting safe, high-quality food on our tables, while at the same time making a massive contribution to the European and global economy and striving to contribute to the twin green and digital transitions. But while the sector has shown remarkable resilience in the face of challenges such as pandemic and Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, we must ensure that our food system is also fit for the future. With the Green Deal, we have already put in place an ambitious roadmap to lead us to that future. And yet the reality of climate change, biodiversity loss, growing resource scarcity, price shocks and an increasingly competitive global market is having a huge impact on the farming sector and rural communities. We have seen from the farmers protesting on the streets of Europe that many of them feel trapped, that their needs are not being met. So we must act to secure the future of the sector and those who work within it, and those who benefit from it, namely all of us. We have to ensure that the agri-food sector remains competitive, but with decent incomes for all farmers and SMEs along the entire chain, not least to attract the next generation of young farmers, all whilst bringing the sector within the planetary boundaries. And this means a future where farming and nature go hand in hand in balance. Views on how to move forward are understandably varied, and we have seen increasing polarisation on the number of topics. It is therefore imperative that we will bring all the stakeholders together to see how we can look for joint solutions and define a common vision and reach a new consensus. That is why we launched the strategic dialogue on the future of agriculture in the European Union. And I had the pleasure to discuss the dialogue with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of this House, as well as with the ministers in the Agriculture and Fisheries Council ahead of its launch on 25 January. The dialogue involves participants from EU-level associations and organisations, including umbrella organisations representing a number of European groups. There are many reasons which have driven farmers onto the streets in the past weeks, and it’s important not to oversimplify the situation – because the problems of agri food sectors are complex. There are those whom the system serves well and there are those who are being left behind. There are environmental champions, and there are those who need our help to become more sustainable. There are those who benefit from open trade, and there are those who are being squeezed by it. So that is why the strategic dialogue must cover all the core questions and involve all stakeholders, and I believe that we should focus on ensuring a fair standard of living for farmers and rural communities, supporting agriculture within the boundaries of our planet and its ecosystem. We should discuss how to exploit the huge opportunities offered by knowledge and technological innovation, and how to promote a thriving future for the EU’s food system in the competitive world. Let me also highlight that our farmers continue being supported by EU budgets through the common agricultural policy. But we know that this money alone is not enough to address the challenges we are discussing today, nor to deal with climate change. Let us look at the devastating droughts in Spain, the apocalyptic floods in Greece, Slovenia, Italy and elsewhere, the forest fires raging out of control. So inaction would merely lead to even greater costs in the coming decades. Such disasters can only be prevented if we have healthy natural resources and only healthy soils, clean water and abundant pollinators can protect high yields and farmers’ incomes in the face of climate and biodiversity crises. Farmers know what they are doing and I have seen this for myself first-hand. So our job now is to support farmers in the transition, helping them de-risk this necessary transformation and scaling up all the good practices in agriculture. It is crucial to work with the entire food chain, so that consumers can better appreciate the value of sustainability. Our farmers deserve to make a decent living, and that will only happen if we work together to achieve our climate and biodiversity goals. I know that the future of agriculture is a complex topic for conversation, but I firmly believe that this strategic dialogue will ultimately help us speak with one voice of the common future we will pursue for farmers, the environment, and our union as a whole. So let’s work together. Let’s discuss it thoroughly also this morning. I will stop here and, Mr President, I very much look forward to our debate.",-,2024-02-07,4.

Bart Groothuis,"Mr President, dear Minister, dear Commissioner, I think today we have to speak about mitigating the risk about deepfakes. And of course – of course – we have to criminalise the sharing of deepfake videos of Taylor Swift. We have to oblige creators of deepfake videos to put a label there. But the only way to tackle real – real – threats to our democracy and security is to put obligations on platforms, just like we ask platforms to tackle illegal content, IP infringements, spam, botnets, terrorist content and much more. And rightly so. But no obligations were set for platforms when it comes to deepfakes. Two years ago, we had a great opportunity to oblige Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, et cetera to detect and to watermark and label deepfake videos on the platform, so citizens at least know when a deepfake goes viral that it’s not real. My amendments on this made it to Parliament’s negotiating position, and thank you for that, rapporteur Christel Schaldemose, but it didn’t make it to the final position of the law. The big tech lobby won. And I’m very disappointed about that. Two years ago, one might say, ‘Deepfakes – is that a real life problem?’ But in 2024, we see daily deepfake scams and it’s rising fast and we need best-effort obligations for platforms to detect deepfakes and to label it as an obligation for them.

We were asked to massively expand the EU machinery for sharing biometric data, with no evidence that this would do anything to make crime investigation more effective or more successful. We were just asked to trust the Commission that that would happen. Well, no thanks, I don’t think so! Not just that: we were asked to agree that third countries could launder their dodgy data into EU police forces’ data. For example, we now have a situation where the EU trusted partner Israel has a direct line to flag its political opponents – and there are many – to Europe’s police forces and to pursue them in Europe. And we’re supposed to bank on Europol’s notoriously shabby quality control to filter out the scurrilous falsehoods from the real thing. We know that that won’t happen.

Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield,"Mr President, the Greens and the Pirates, contrary to most of you, are very concerned about the Prüm II Regulation. Civil society organisations have pointed out the insufficient safeguards. Prüm I failed to demonstrate its necessity and proportionality, and Prüm II will now expand data categories and optimise exchanges of information. It will bring in a centralised router enabling the automated exchange of facial images and police records. It will increase the exchange of personal data among police authorities, and it will allow for searches into police databases containing personal data before even any crime has been committed, for so-called crime prevention. Searching for those convicted of crimes, indeed, but also for suspects and in certain cases, victims. We are already seeing what happens when the power of law enforcement goes unchecked. In France, people are arrested for nothing more than attending a protest, and they will then enter this famous database. At the EU borders, experiments with invasive biometric surveillance technologies against vulnerable migrant populations, and this list goes on. And will this regulation stand up at the European Court of Justice in terms of the processing of biometric data? The lack of safeguards and the expansion of facial recognition jeopardise our privacy and our data protection. With Prüm II not only do we increase police powers across Europe and reduce the control we have over our own data, but we also decrease the level of scrutiny citizens have over law enforcement and of creeping police surveillance.

Ylva Johansson,"Madam President, honourable Members, Mr rapporteur Paulo Rangel, organised criminal networks are a severe threat to our societies. Last year, more than 600 explosions in the Netherlands alone. In Sweden last year 350 criminal shootings killing 53 people and more than 300 children aged 15 to 17 charged with murder or attempted murder in Sweden alone. Child soldiers in a drugs war. Children killing children. Imagine those were terrorist shootings, terrorist bombs, terrorist killings. To me, it’s clear, organised crime is as big, big a threat to society as terrorism. We have to counter this threat with all the means at our disposal. We have achieved much more on security than we intended four years ago when we started this mandate. Most recently, the Commission launched the European Ports Alliance, a public private partnership in the fight against organised crime and drug trafficking. A key step was the new mandate we gave Europol. A new mandate to meet the new challenges of our time. To better support Member States’ police, because police cooperation and information exchange are at the heart of the fight against organised crime. After all, it takes a network to fight a network. That is also why I welcome the agreement by Parliament and Council on the updated Prüm framework. This is the third and final pillar in our police cooperation package, after the Council recommendation on operational police cooperation and a directive on Law Enforcement Information Exchange. Prüm is an important tool for police officers on the ground to check if a suspect in front of them is known for crimes in other Member States, and essential to stop dangerous criminals. Some examples: after a knife attack in The Hague, police found DNA on the knife. A check showed French police had matching DNA on record, allowing the suspect to be arrested. After robberies of cash machines in Estonia, police found DNA on the scene. A check showed several Member States had matching profiles. The criminal group could be dismantled and the leaders arrested. Or petty thefts against tourists in France. A check for fingerprints revealed a pan-European organised crime network that was also involved in a much more serious crime of trafficking in human beings. We have now modernised the 15 year old Prüm framework with Prüm II, to speed up and improve police information exchange and bring it up to date. Now police still have to make checks against all other Member States databases. In the future, police will only have to make one single check covering all Member States, thanks to a new central router. And we are also making new kinds of checks possible. Today, police can already check if there are hits on fingerprints, car number plates and DNA. In future, police will also be able to check for hits on police records and facial images, thanks to this agreement. And that is an important update not only to catch criminals, but also to find missing people. Missing children, because in the last 15 years, digital photos have become much more important in police investigations. Often, facial images are the only leads police have. Other essential update: Europol will take part in the data exchange. This is essential because Europol is at the heart of police cooperation in the European Union. I would like to specially thank the rapporteur, Paolo Rangel and the shadows for their work. I thank Parliament and Council for reaching this balanced compromise. A game changer for law enforcement. Tomorrow, when you vote on this, will be a good day for citizens and a bad day for criminals. Tomorrow your vote will make Europe a safer place and you can be proud of that.",-,2024-02-07,14.

Margaritis Schinas,"Madam President, honourable Members, thank you for this long debate, but a converging one. What makes Europe a unique place in the world is that we are a union of 27 democracies. The minorities are protected with strong constitutional guarantees. The role of women is safeguarded in the family, in the society and in the workplace. We are the world champions of human rights, of data protection. We have universal and free systems for education and health. We take care of our elderly and we have no death penalty. This is what everybody calls the European way of life. Anti-Semitism and Islamophobia are forms of threats to this model of society that unites us. These turbulent times should not be an excuse for polarisation, indifference and threat to this model of society that makes us a beacon of light in a world that is becoming darker. In these turbulent times, we need an opportunity to strengthen our mutual respect, to reinforce our cohesion and solidarity, to protect the safety and the security of all communities living in the European Union, irrespective of their religious, ethnic or gender background. No one – no one – in Europe should have to hide their identity because they feel threatened. And this together.

Seán Kelly,"A Uachtaráin, it’s only right we should fight against hatred of all types: antisemitism, anti-Muslimism, but also anti-Christian hatred. Only last week we saw a church in Turkey being attacked during mass. Christians are the most persecuted minority in many parts of the world, and that’s something that we EPP Christian Democrats would have to condemn and would like to see addressed. Also, it has to be said that, in relation to antisemitism, while Netanyahu had a right to defend Israel after the horrific attacks by Hamas, he’s gone over the top completely. The indiscriminate killing of so many Palestinians, women and children, is something that we’d have to condemn, and that actually makes it very difficult to fight against antisemitism. And that is something we have to recognise and hopefully bring about peace there. As well as that, we need to look at the platforms that have become a home for the haters and a home for the bitter – to use it, often anonymously, to spread hatred. And that’s something we need to look at, particularly in the next mandate: look at Twitter and the like to stop this free opportunity to spread hatred.

Clare Daly,"Madam President, the wretched history of antisemitism and Islamophobia on this continent is measured in centuries. Both have produced horrific crimes. Neither has gone away. And our moral rejection of bigotry must be absolute and resolute. Hatred and dehumanisation lead all too quickly to violence and repression, and nobody from any minority should experience it. And I really wish I could say that that was the dominant approach here. But I can’t, because instead now Europe’s approach is to see novel forms of both bigotries reinforcing each other. So we see European governments parroting Islamophobic ‘war on terror’ tropes to dehumanise innocent victims in Gaza as violent and savage, enabling violence against them. We see false and cynical accusations of antisemitism against legitimate demonstrations condemning genocide.

But away from the far right in this European Parliament, away from the far-right government in Israel, or the far-right Hamas in Gaza, I’ll just mention one beautiful story. It is that of two men: David, who is Jewish, and his partner Amir, who is Palestinian, who have been living together for 15 years in a region which is in turmoil. They built their family over there. And yet this is only one example of so many interesting stories of people who come together in love, notwithstanding the hate of the far right. Because let’s speak of the far-right hate, the homophobia. They would be against this couple. The former antisemites would be against half of this couple, and now they’re against the other half with their Islamophobia. These are so many countless stories of love.

On Monday, you blocked a debate about the UN’s highest court ruling that the Israelis supporting an entire predominantly Muslim population at risk of genocide. Looking at Germany may help us understand this contradiction; it arms Israel and it supported our defeated case at the ICJ. It materially and politically supports genocide of Muslims in Gaza. At the same time, in the name of fighting antisemitism at home, 30% of events cancelled due to suspected antisemitism are actually anti-Zionist events organised by Jewish people. In the fight against antisemitism, German police forces are kicking down doors and beating Muslims in the street for speaking out against the genocide of their own people in Gaza.

The Swedish party leader used artificial intelligence to address the Muslim and Arabic-speaking community in Sweden, asking them basically to leave Sweden if they do not totally give up on their culture and religion. And the Chair of the Justice Committee in the Swedish Parliament wants to forbid Islamic symbols such as half-moons and minarets because they scare him. And another example, the Alternative für Deutschland wants to put forward a proposal that would make it possible to mass deport Muslims, Arab Africans. Thousands of Germans went to the streets to demonstrate how the German society is united against racism and fascism, but when people holding the Palestinian flag wanted to participate in the rally, they were spitted on, kicked on, beaten, not allowed to participate. The same very people that AfD wants to mass-deport. How ironic is that, don’t you think? And this House reacts very differently when the oppressor is a black person, or a Muslim or an Arab, while when the victim is Muslim or Arab, that’s a totally different reaction you get from this house.

Maria Walsh,"Madam President, Commissioner, parliamentarians, illegal hate speech has no place in our society online or offline. Illegal hate speech needs to be met with a level of punishment set at EU level. In Ireland, the Oireachtas is currently working on a new criminal justice bill specifically dedicated to hate speech. In December, our capital city of Dublin witnessed riots which were motivated by hate and by violence, fuelled by those who want to see us divided. Those who purposely peddle hate speech, who incite violence, have become smarter, unfortunately. They use social media platforms as a tool to take advantage of people by bombarding them with false information or by dressing their hate speech in subtle language, so the line between freedom of speech and hatred is blurred. Elon Musk has tried to create outrage by saying that the Digital Services Act will result in armed police storming people's houses. He can pretend that he defends free speech, but do not be confused: he and some others who shout against this legislation are focused only on their own self-interests.

The horrific Hamas terrorist attack in Israel and the war in Gaza has put that promise to the test and, as it stands, we are failing. The prioritisation of speed over accuracy has meant legitimate content has been removed, while hate speech slips through. Pro-Palestinian views have de facto or ‘de algorithm’ been censored. A platform’s choice in detection systems has resulted in overzealous detection of Arabic-language hate speech, while leaving detection of Hebrew-language hate speech inaccurate. Since 7 October, we have also seen an avalanche of disinformation – the use of AI-generated content, and misrepresentation of images from other conflicts to garner support. We are tested in times like these. Platforms cannot rely on algorithms alone, because remember, platforms do not understand context.

Last November, as buses burned in the centre of Dublin city, an individual sought out foreigners to attack. Rapid dissemination of inflammatory content online became a catalyst for real-world violence. However, I am conflicted about Ireland’s own hate speech legislation. On the one hand, Elon Musk says he will fund a legal challenge to the proposal, which in my book means it must be very good.

Margaritis Schinas,"Madam President, honourable Members, this is a very timely debate. Today, we are four months after 7 October and four months before the European elections. Over the past weeks, we have witnessed an alarming surge in hate speech, hate crime across Europe, in the streets of our cities, as well as online. We cannot remain indifferent. The heinous terrorist attack by Hamas shook us all to our core. Not since the Holocaust had so many Jewish lives been lost on a single day. This attack still reverberates among the Jewish communities in Europe and around the world. From the first moment, the European Union supported Israel’s right to defend itself in line with international law and international humanitarian law, and has called for the unconditional release of the hostages. At the same time, we are witnessing a dramatic humanitarian situation affecting the Palestinian population in Gaza. Addressing this humanitarian crisis and ensuring the protection of civilians, including children and the vulnerable, and avoiding regional escalation must now be our top priority. As the situation in the Middle East unfolds, many individuals, including many Jews and Muslims in Europe, are mourning and worrying about their loved ones. And to add to this, many Jews and Muslims living in Europe are also fearing for their own safety. Since 7 October, we are witnessing with horror a rise in anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim incidents, Molotov cocktails thrown at synagogues, Stars of David sprayed on residential buildings, Jewish stores destroyed, Swastikas and anti-Muslim slurs spray painted on mosques and houses, an attempt to set a mosque on fire when people were praying inside, Jewish and Muslim cemeteries desecrated. Anti-Muslimism and anti-Semitism have also exploded online, with slogans calling for the destruction of the State of Israel, the killing of all Jews, glorifying terrorism, or calling for Muslim migrants to be killed or expelled, and Muslim women to be raped. This is simply unacceptable. It is incompatible with all that the European Union stands for, with a model of society that represents us, with our European way of life. In Europe today, a Europe of equality, no minority should live in fear, irrespective of which side of the political spectrum each one of us comes from, irrespective of where you take your seat in this hemicycle. We must all unequivocally condemn such acts of hate. On the Commission’s side, we have acted immediately and decisively. As Vice-President in charge, I visited several Jewish communities immediately after 7 October, first in Strasbourg, then in Antwerp, then in Thessaloniki, and overseas in Melbourne, in Sao Paulo. We accelerated the implementation of many of the actions under our EU strategy on combating anti-Semitism and fostering Jewish life. On 6 December, we adopted a new targeted communication entitled ‘No place for hate: a Europe united against hatred’. We are stepping up efforts to fight hatred in all its forms by reinforcing action across the policy spectrum, measures to counter physical as well as online threats, increasing the scrutiny of beneficiaries of EU funding to ensure respect of our values, and raising awareness through education, culture and sport. Let us never forget that it was hate and anti-Semitism that led to the Holocaust. The Holocaust was a European tragedy, but it happened locally. In Nazi death camps, shooting grounds, at deportation points and hiding places. This is why we are launching a major initiative today to establish a network of places where the Holocaust happened. We want to ensure that every child in Europe learns about the darkest chapter of our history. Security remains also a top concern. We are making extra funding available to protect places of worship and other premises. We launched a new call for proposals in December with a total budget of EUR 30 million. Of this, EUR 5 million will be dedicated specifically to projects protecting Jewish places of worship, schools and community gatherings. In the online environment, we are addressing the explosion of racist, anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim hate for the first time with the regulatory instruments that we managed to obtain under this political cycle, with a close cooperation of the European Parliament and our Member States with the Digital Services Act. You just had the debate. I’m not going into the specifics. Thierry Breton has just presented what we can do under the Digital Services Act. We have also now working with a major online platform to reinforce the code of conduct on countering illegal hate speech online, as soon as possible. And we have increased funding to address anti-Semitism online through a network of trusted flaggers and fact checkers across the EU. In parallel, we are working closely with Europol and our Member States’ law enforcement agencies to make sure that terrorist content online and the glorification of terrorism on European streets are pursued vigorously. Honourable Members, dear friends, we are not naive. We are fully aware that no communication, no strategy from Brussels, no amount of EU funding will ever be sufficient in itself to address centuries-old prejudice and often rekindled but orchestrated disinformation campaigns. We know we must act on all levels and engage society as a whole. On 19 December 2023, I called for an extraordinary high-level meeting of religious leaders – Christian, Muslim and Jewish – to discuss the impact of the conflict in the Middle East, and I was genuinely encouraged by their joint determination to stand up against hatred and speak up for tolerance and respect. In line with our EU strategy, the conclusions of the European Council last December, I call now upon all Member States to do their part to adopt and implement the national strategies on combating anti-Semitism and national action plans against racism, and to ensure that the necessary resources are available to protect Jewish and Muslim communities from hatred. Beyond the Member States, we at the Commission are committed to engage directly with citizens. It is a citizens’ topic. It is not a discussion that needs to be taken in offices and in conference rooms. The first half of this year, we will organise a European Citizens’ Panel on action against hatred. We are determined to have citizens on board to help us identify action for all Europeans, to ensure that Europe is a place where our founding values are enjoyed by anyone, by everyone, on an equal basis.

Assita Kanko,"Madam President, saying that anti-Semitism is unacceptable has nothing to do with Muslim hatred. It is sad and disappointing that these two topics have been connected for today’s debate. How cynical. We all know who needs protection today against whom: it is the Jewish schools, museums and synagogues that are guarded, and we all know why. But why is it so difficult to say it, to name the reality, the Islamic anti-Semitism? We saw it in the streets here in Europe, calling to destroy the Jews. We saw it in the murders in the Jewish Museum in Belgium. We saw it in the celebration of the pogrom in Israel. We saw it in the pressure for the silence kept by international organisations who ignored the pain of the Jewish women. The reason why they kept silence is the same reason why, whenever you say anything about anti-Semitism, they want to add Muslim hatred in the conversation or they say that you are a racist. It is the reason why so many European countries use taxpayers’ money to sponsor organisations who pretend to fight racism and Islamophobia, but are the tentacles of the Muslim Brotherhood operating here to feed its forces against us in Europe. Today is Shani Louk’s birthday. She was born on 7 February 2001 and killed on 7 October in Israel.

However, we can’t put anti-Semitism, which is a dramatic reality, and anti-Muslim hatred on the same level. The hard truth is that after the 7 October, after the first pogrom of Israeli people inside Israel, anti-Semitism came back as a flame all over Europe. The horror of those scenes of slaughter of innocent Jewish people inflamed not just the moral condemnation of the aggressors, but also the irrational and motivated hate against Jews. We have to say that Jews are hated mostly by Muslim immigrants nowadays in Europe. They are not the only ones, but they are the main promoters of the new anti—Semitism, together with the far left. We don’t want to cancel the truth, we don’t accept this equalisation and therefore we are not equidistant.

However, I’m disappointed a little bit when I didn’t see anti-gypsyism beside these on the agenda here today, though. The Roma are the largest and probably the most discriminated ethnic minority in Europe, and the rise of the hatred against us Roma, Sinto, Gitano, Cigano gypsies in the recent years is very serious and all too often overlooked. But now we have the European Roma inclusion strategies on Roma and it’s a very, very good tool to fight.

Charlie Weimers,"Madam President, would you feel safe walking Europe’s streets with a kippah? No. Just read the statements by Swedish Jews in an official EU study: ‘I never wear any Jewish symbols publicly’. Sweden was not antisemitic at all before, but that has changed. For centuries, European Jews have been interwoven in the tapestry of our history, culture, art, science, philosophy and law, but that has changed. Mass migration from the Islamic world has spawned a cancer that festered and grew in Muslim enclaves. This is why so many are afraid to live an open Jewish life in Europe. In the wake of the barbaric attack by Hamas, antisemitism has intensified. Cheerleading and jubilant rallies for these Islamist butchers took place all over Europe. This is naked antisemitism cloaked with a thin veil of anti-Zionism, as they call it. Colleagues, in order to crush antisemitism, we must end mass migration. We must deny citizenship to those who espouse antisemitic beliefs, and when we can, we should revoke citizenship for those convicted of antisemitic crimes.

I would also like to thank you, Commissioner Schmit. It’s been a great pleasure to work with all of you, work with your staff advisors on this important file. And then I would like to say to all of you, to my dear colleagues, with tomorrow’s vote, we are making a difference for workers in Europe. We are making sure that millions will be better protected. This is the socially just green transition, not just in words but put into action. When we see that the workers producing our batteries, making our renewable energy, or energy renovating our houses will be better protected. As has been said by me, but also very importantly by other good colleagues today, no one should die or get sick from going to work. That is why it is so important that we today put workers health at the forefront. I would like to thank you once again to all that have contributed. Let us all make sure to bring all our colleagues on board before tomorrow’s vote. And finally, allow me to say that by judging on today’s debate and the discussion I have had as the rapporteur with the political groups, I note that there is a broad support in the European Parliament for an ambitious European occupational health and safety policy. We stand united in eagerly awaiting the Commission’s CMRD 6 Directive, and for the long-promised and wasted screening and registration of asbestos in buildings legislative proposal. I hope that the Commissioner took note of this as well. And I heard you, Commissioner, when you said that you stand ready to continue on the track that we are on today. That is good.

Nicolas Schmit,"Madam President, first, I want to thank Parliament for this very solid and large support. I think what we have all in mind is that nobody should really be exposed to health problems at his or her working place. This was, from the beginning of this mandate, one of our major objectives: to increase the protection in different areas. We were quite ambitious in that context, and we have achieved a lot. But I agree, we have not yet achieved what we have to achieve. So there is still a lot to do. I’m sure that, I hope at least, during the next mandate of the European Parliament and the Commission, we will continue on this track, because this is something where Europe can make and makes a difference. A real difference. Therefore I think we can be proud of what has been done, and especially also on this particular directive, which I hope will get a positive vote tomorrow.

Nicolas Schmit,"Madam President, dear Members, first of all, I would like to thank the European Parliament, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and the rapporteur, Mr Nikolaj Villumsen, for the outstanding work during the last months that was essential to reach a good political agreement on this important file. Ensuring safe workplaces is a continuous objective of the Commission, as it has been ever since the first European Community. The swift agreement on stricter rules preventing exposure from lead and diisocyanates at work will contribute to achieving this goal. The amending directive also delivers on the commitment made under the European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan and the EU’s Strategic Framework on Health and Safety at Work (2021-2027). The political agreement debated today will benefit about 100 000 workers exposed to lead in the EU, and 4.2 million workers exposed to diisocyanates. Concerning lead, significantly reduced limit values will help prevent damaging health effects, including those affecting reproductive functions and foetal development. As regards diisocyanates, the first ever EU exposure limits will prevent cases of occupational asthma and other respiratory diseases, and complement existing EU measures under the REACH Regulation. The directive also addresses workers with historic exposure and aims to improve the protection of women of childbearing age. Both substances will be critical in the industrial processes needed to advance the EU’s transition to climate neutrality, and the new legislation will help promote a green transition closely connected to safety and health at work, which seems to me absolutely indispensable – we do not want to save the planet and at the same time make people sick and threaten their health and safety. Moreover, the Commission working closely with EU agencies – European Chemicals Agency and the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work – will provide guidelines to facilitate the implementation of the directive, covering aspects such as on the effects of exposure to a combination of substances and on health surveillance and biological monitoring. Let me just mention that the Commission has submitted a statement in relation to the institutional prerogatives of the Commission and the well-established procedure in the area of occupational safety and health. I commend the excellent collaboration on this agreement. Once approved, the new directive will contribute to healthier workplaces. Now we need to make sure these new provisions are effectively implemented, and I count on your continuous support in our collective effort to protect workers and society at large. Commission statement (in writing) “The Commission recalls that the right of initiative accorded to it under the Treaties includes the right to decide whether or not to submit a legislative proposal and, including, as the case may be, to determine the subject-matter, objective, content and timeline of such proposal and/or related action. The provisions of the Directive which request the Commission: to review the limit values for lead and its inorganic compounds and for diisocyanates, to develop guidelines on health surveillance and biological monitoring regarding lead, to assess the effects of exposure to a combination of substances with a view to develop Union guidelines, to assess the appropriateness of including endocrine disruptors within the scope of the Directive must thus be understood as being without prejudice to the Commission’s right of initiative under the Treaties. The Commission declares that any possible legislative proposal and/or action on any of the above-mentioned issues will be prepared in adherence to the well-established process in the area of occupational safety and health, and within the requisite timelines, thorough consultation and involvement of social partners and external stakeholders, and in line with its Better Regulation agenda. Besides the two-stage consultation of social partners set out in Article 154 TFEU, this process includes the consultation of the tripartite Advisory Committee on Safety and Health at Work, the opinion of the Risk Assessment Committee of the European Chemicals Agency and an impact assessment.”",-,2024-02-06,14.

Nikolaj Villumsen,"Madam President, dear Commissioner, dear colleagues, Europe can make a difference for workers. We can put the health and safety of those workers who build our wind turbines, assemble our batteries and energy renovate our homes at the forefront. This piece of EU legislation that we will vote on tomorrow will lead to concrete improvements for literally millions of workers out there in the factories, construction sites and even deep down in the mines. It is legislation affecting those working in recycling or furniture production, auto mechanics, construction, industry and metalworkers and many, many more. We are ensuring better and much-needed protection against the dangerous substances – lead and diisocyanates. It means that we, for the first time in 40 years, will update the limit values on lead. We will lower the value to less than a quarter of what it is now. This is progress, and it is important, because not only is lead carcinogenic and reprotoxic, it is also a central part of the growing battery and recycling sector in Europe. It is something we know is dangerous, but at the same time we cannot do without it. But by drastically improving the protection against it, we take an important step. We help ensure that the green transition – which we all need – will not sacrifice workers’ health and safety. We also ensure that we will not have to wait another 40 years for the next revision, as we have obliged the Commission to review the limit values again in only 5 years’ time, if not before. And it does not stop here: we will also introduce the first-ever European limit value on the harmful diisocyanates, substances we know give permanent airway damage to those who work with it. This means that we help to ensure that the European green transition can be a just transition. Dear colleagues, I truly believe that no one should get sick or die from going to work. That is why we in Parliament must always try to move Europe’s occupational health and safety legislation forward. With this directive, we do take an important first step towards protecting workers against endocrine disruptors and combined exposure at their workplace. This sets the direction for future initiatives. Dear colleagues, I want to sincerely thank the shadows: it has been a great pleasure to work with you. Thank you for a good cooperation and for helping putting workers’ health first. I also want to thank the Commission, the Council, and the Spanish Presidency: you did not give us everything we asked for, but you showed flexibility and agreed that we should move forward to the benefit of millions of hard-working people in Europe. Lastly, I want to thank the social partners – employers and trade unions alike. Your invaluable cooperation and insights helped make this directive a reality. So, dear colleagues, when we vote tomorrow, let us have a large majority and send a clear message to all the workers in Europe: Your health and safety matters.

Our geopolitical environment is very different than 2019 and naivety should disappear for good. Russia, but not only Russia, is conducting different schemes to exert influence and to interfere in our political processes. European Union institutions are under frequent threat, particularly our democratically elected body. The Kremlin has perfected a cheap tool that allows it to strengthen other authoritarian regimes, amplify illiberal voices in full-fledged democracies, poison information ecosystems and undermine elections and other democratic institutions. Putin counted and still counts not only on the army in uniforms, but also on the army without uniforms. Whether it’s about money, ideology or particular interest, their work undermines the European Union and poses an increasing security threat. That is why we need to do more to protect our democracy and integrity of the European Union. Focus should be on fostering democratic resilience. Definitely the work of the INGE Committee, of which I was a proud member, needs to be continued in the next mandate as these issues will not go away. On the contrary, we can expect the unexpected.

More recently, it has invested heavily into various parties on the extreme left and extreme right of the political spectrum in order to destabilise Europe. The Brexit campaign and Trump’s victory overseas demonstrates the success of Russian interference and the disruption and chaos it can cause. A new and frightening development today is the extent and efficiency with which Russia relies on proxies, like Mr Orbán’s regime in Hungary. The Orbán government not only disseminates Putin’s propaganda and blocks common European initiatives, but also interferes in various European elections to promote the illiberal cause – as has happened in France, Slovakia, Poland and Slovenia, as well as in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and North Macedonia.

We must investigate how far the FSB reaches in Europe and stop them from reaching to the highest levels of policymaking. Also, we must expose to the fullest the financial channels from Russia, which bolster European organisations and politicians propagating hate, for instance by anti-LGBT sentiments. Their aim is clear: to create divisive conflict in our society. We owe it to our future generations and to the brave people of Ukraine, who will hopefully soon join the Union. We want a strong and confident Europe, free of hostile Russian influence. From the outset of the invasion, the European Pirate Party has vocally supported Ukraine.

Margaritis Schinas,"Mr President, Madame la Ministre, honourable Members, I appreciate that you will focus more on what I have to say, rather than on the state of my voice, but I will try to get through. Our democracy is strong and resilient, but needs to constantly evolve and adapt. We are all aware of the many threats, such as foreign interference coming from Russia or other authoritarian forces, but also floods of disinformation, fake news, cyberattacks, just to mention a few. We have, collectively, to remain vigilant and address these risks decisively. Let me start first with the diagnostics. What are we really facing these days? Only two weeks ago, a report by the German Federal Foreign Office found that Russia had used more than 50 000 fake accounts on X, sending more than one million tweets in order to manipulate public opinion only in Germany. During the pandemic, systematic disinformation campaigns sought to foster doubts about the successful vaccination programmes of the EU. This showed that disinformation can really kill, because that was the worst moment when the death tolls were surging. I’m sure you would remember, as I do, the alleged Russian military vehicles going up and down the Italian highways to support the Italian COVID victims. We are also witnessing, since February 2022, a wave of disinformation used as a weapon by Russia in their aggressive war against Ukraine. Distorting facts, publishing false de-Nazification narratives and trying to take advantage of war fatigue to shift priorities and attention. Finally, we also now know of the multiple attempts to interfere with democratic processes and systems in the European Union across Europe that have also been made systematically by Russia and recognised and documented in the report of the European Parliament’s Special Committee. Let me recall the findings of multiple studies of Russian-based social media accounts and Russian-paid online advertising, massively engaging in the days before the Brexit referendum in favour of leave. We now know all the reports on close and regular contacts, including organised visits between Russian officials and representatives of a group of Catalan secessionists in Spain between 2017 and 2020. Of course, it is deeply troubling, the recent allegations that a Member of this House could be working on behalf of the Russian federal security services. But I believe it’s a duty of this House to investigate who else did what, under what conditions, to play the game of Moscow. Kremlin’s war of ideas is a multi-million euro weapon of mass manipulation. As we have already recognised in the Commission’s Security Union Strategy, it is used to mislead and deceive our citizens, divide, polarise and exploit the vulnerabilities of our societies, ultimately to destabilise the European democracy. Let me now quickly, Mr President, come to the actions that we have been developing in the von der Leyen Commission to counter this unprecedented wave of Russian interference. We have developed six concrete initiatives. I will take them one by one. Step one: in December last year we propose the defence of democracy package. Then the idea is to focus on transparency and democratic accountability while addressing the issue of foreign interference. The key element of this package is a proposal for a directive laying down common transparency and accountability standards for interest representation on behalf of their countries. Step number two: the recently agreed European Media Freedom Act will strengthen regulatory coordination in order to protect the internal media market from foreign outlets, those that engage in systematic international campaigns of manipulation and interference. With this law, we have also reached a political agreement on the regulation of transparency of political advertising. Step number three: three years ago, together with Parliament and the Council, we reached the agreement on the Mandatory Transparency Register. We believe that the EU institutions must meet the highest standards of transparency and integrity. Step number four: ethics and accountability. We have adopted a proposal for the creation of an interinstitutional ethics body and, with this proposal, there will be, for the first time, common standards for ethical conduct of members of all institutions. We are proud in the Commission to have been following these rules to the letter. We really hope that the European institutions can work together to find an agreement on the creation of a body that would harmonise the conditions across the institutional landscape. Step number five: in May, we presented a legislative proposal to update the criminal law approach to corruption. Our proposal would close the gaps between different definitions of corruption, so that all kinds of corruption phenomena are criminalised, including trading in influence, abuse of power, and obstruction of justice. Of course, all EU politicians, all members of the institutions, will be covered by this proposal. Finally, step number six, and probably the ultimate weapon: we now have in the European Union a solid regulatory framework with the Digital Services Act that allows us to enable and deploy regulatory instruments against the platforms and those who refuse to cooperate in defending the citizens of Europe against this phenomenon. Thank you all for your participation today. I look forward to the debate.",-,2024-02-06,13.

Virginijus Sinkevičius,"Mr President, honourable Members, first of all thank you very much for this lively debate, which shows once again the importance of this topic. It also reflects the complexity – and there are no easy solutions – but thank you very much for a very clear call for a new EU Blue Deal. Let me just reiterate that the initiative that we will put forward will, first of all, focus on a number of immediate actions that can be taken by the current Commission, while also mapping the key issues and launching a public debate. However, this will not prejudge the political choices that will have to be made by the new college as from the autumn of 2024. The aim of the Water Resilience Initiative is, first of all, to take stock of the main water challenges and opportunities faced by the EU and outline a series of immediate actions, as well as to include the stakeholders, involving EU institutions, Member States, relevant stakeholders, local and regional authorities, private sectors, NGOs and academia but also, most importantly, keeping the political momentum. So the debate in this House is extremely important to keep that momentum going. The initiative now is being developed around the three key objectives: protect and restore the water cycle; towards an EU water-smart economy; and clean water and sanitation for all. This is with three enablers: governance, finance and investment; research and innovation; and an international section. For each we are in the process of identifying concrete, immediate actions that can be taken by the current Commission, as I have said. Now, there was also an important question as regards the data. So, absolutely, the Commission of course uses the data and we base our recommendations, our further work, on the data that the Member States feed to the Commission, and then that data, of course, is used by the Environment Agency. Our planet is the engine of the water cycle, and we have to look after this engine. If we want adequate supplies of clean water, we need to nurture and restore the ecosystems that purify water and hold it in store – not just our soils and our forests, our rivers and wetlands, but our marine waters too, where coastal communities depend on non-polluted water for fisheries, aquaculture and tourism. Success will depend on scaling up action and funding to create a water-smart economy which optimises the use of scarce resources, meeting the needs of current and future generations. In agriculture, this means a more efficient use of water, wastewater reuse, soil management and vegetation cover, drought resistant crops and restoration of damaged areas. In energy and transport, it means preparing for disruptions to hydropower, plant cooling and waterborne transport. For drinking water, it means promoting leakage reductions with additional supply infrastructure as a last resort. Adaptation solutions will be required in every aspect of life, in every sector, on every time scale. Nature-based solutions are particularly well-suited for climate resilience to water impacts, and where that’s not feasible, let’s opt for hybrid green-grey solutions. Lastly, we need wider recognition of the fact that water is a public good, so more must be done to deliver on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation in the EU and globally. To achieve it, we need strengthened governance of water resources, increase awareness, to promote research and innovation, including digital solutions, and, of course, mobilising increased public and private funding. These investments must be part of the comprehensive strategic vision and hence the need for a water resilience agenda. The support of this House is going to be essential and crucial for delivering this agenda.",-,2024-02-06,"11.

Wopke Hoekstra,"Mr President, thank you very much, and may I also thank all the Members of this esteemed House for their thoughts, for their comments, for their feedback, occasional compliments, and solicited and less solicited advice or criticism. I did sense, though, that there is significant support for the direction of travel. If you allow me, Mr President, I would want to make four departing comments, also listening to the speakers. One is – and let me be clear on that one more time – that this is a direction of travel. This is a dot on the horizon. It is the start of the dialogue rather than the point of destination. I’m saying that because some of the Members of Parliament have actually expressed the things that they think should have been in there. But actually, in my view, that needs to be part of the dialogue that we’re going to have, not only with Parliament but also with others in our societies. So that is one. Secondly, I want to stress – Ms Bentele and Mr Liese have mentioned that – the tremendous importance of doing a lot of stuff here at home in Europe, but also working tirelessly on the 93 % of emissions that do take place outside of our continent. Therefore, climate diplomacy, and in particular diplomacy related to carbon markets, is of essential importance. I very much concur with what they said. Third, the point made by, um, Mr Canfin and a couple of others about the geopolitics. I’m very much aligned with all those that say – and I’ve stressed it in the beginning myself – that we need to marry climate action with competitiveness, a level playing field and a just transition. I think we all agree on that. But I think it was extremely important that they mentioned the international dimension and the link to strategic autonomy as well, because that is unfortunately the world we live in, and it is something we do need to take into account moving forward. Finally, there were a couple of comments on CCS. What I would want to say there is that I would want to invite everyone to move beyond, let’s say, ideological positions. I will be the first to continue to stress that there is no alternative for driving down emissions. As I’ve said before, and I’m gladly going to repeat it, we cannot CCS ourselves out of the problem. That is one part. I will stress that to everyone who says that actually CCS will magically solve this. To the others who look at CCS with maybe distrust, I would articulate that it is part of the solution, particularly for the hardest-to-abate sectors, and therefore we also need to embrace this as part of the solution space, even though we know it is only a relatively small proportion of the equation. Finally, linked to that, just to clarify, the 400 number that is in the communication is not just CSS, it is also land-based removals. I think that is important and maybe at least to some degree satisfactory to those who are worried in this domain. Mr President, thank you very much and thanks very much to the MEPs taking part in this debate and all the different other actors that already have given input.

Reinhard Bütikofer,"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, colleagues, I’m glad we have this debate, because we need the full energy and the creativity and the common efforts also of this House to promote the Global Gateway’s agenda. The Global Gateway was announced in 2021. In 2022, it was bogged down because of internal contradictions within the Brussels bureaucracy. In 2023, the Global Gateway made substantial progress, as has been explained, on the governance, on the efforts to push the narrative, to clarify the priorities and on the Global Gateway Forum. This year must become the year in which Brussels and the Member States’ capitals, according to the ‘Team Europe’ approach, make it the centrepiece of the EU’s offer for a new partnership with people and countries in the so-called global South. Without such an offer, our talk about geopolitical ambition will turn into shallow, empty talking points. Global Gateway is not development policy as usual: it is co-development policy, it is a transformative approach with clear priorities that are focussed on the digital transformation, the climate and realistic, resilient supply chains. With the Global Gateway, the EU wants to contribute strategically to the global commons, and the EU can be a driver and shaper of the global transformation. It must be made a central task of the next Commission and this Parliament.",Greens/EFA,2024-02-06,17.

Kim Van Sparrentak,"Mr President, dear Commissioner, dear colleagues, I heard that the European Commission has a fun idea to make sure that young voters vote in the European elections: we should make Taylor Swift tell them to vote. I love a bit of Taylor – absolutely – but here’s another idea for you, bear with me: maybe we could actually listen to young people for once? Because for more than ten years, young people have been asking us to end the exploitation of young people in internships and traineeships and we, the European Parliament, have stood by their side and repeatedly demanded legislation to ban unpaid internships. Then we had a European Year of Youth. We thought, ‘this is the moment’ – and nothing happened. But next month, the European Commission will finally present our plans for better internships. Better late than ever! So, Commissioner, if you want young people to have some faith in Europe, I would propose a ban on unpaid internships.",Greens/EFA,2024-02-06,15.

Dragoş Tudorache,"Mr President, Commissioner Johansson, dear colleagues, weak economies make weak democracies, and weak democracies are susceptible to populist rhetoric inside or to blackmail and pressure from outside. And neither of these will stop. Isolationist rhetoric will rise, as well as bullying for resources – pressure on the global trade and economic rules-based system. And while we are pressed ourselves to consider inward-looking autonomy, we cannot lose sight that free trade, economic integration and well-considered interdependence remain fundamental to attain our strategic objectives. Global Gateway is an important tool for that. Investing wisely around the world, strengthening local economies in democracies in the process, means investing in the future of Europe. Make no mistake about it. China is following its interests, exporting its values and views of the world via trade, including in our own backyard.

But maybe I won’t live that long, but I had to put that on the record, because I want to thank those who are here for your contributions and for your work on this file. And as I said in my opening remarks, this agreement brings many advantages. And that said, our work to support the European investment fund industry and investor protection continues. Paul Tang, if I may call you by your first name, Member of Parliament, your comments are well noted in that regard, and there is always more work to be done. I would say that our retail investment strategy is still being discussed by the co-legislators, and I hope the ambition is maintained. From the Commission’s side, we will continue to closely monitor any developments around investment funds which may require our intervention. We also continue to engage with our international counterparts so that our respective rules and regulations evolve consistently. We will work closely with ESMA on implementation and closely monitor the transposition by Member States. So again, well done, colleagues who worked on this file. I know that others may not realise it, but this really matters because we need investment in our economy to make it more sustainable and to improve the lives of our citizens, and this is part of that.",-,2024-02-06,18.

Paul Tang,"Mr President, let me start by saying that fund managers are better informed on the funds than their supervisors and their investors, and they use this advantage to hide risk from supervisors and to extract high fees from investors. For example, retail investors pay 40% more in fees than professional investors. The fees in some European countries are more than twice those in the UK. This is what economists call rent—seeking, and rent—seeking stands in the way of the CMU – the deeper, integrated capital markets that are instrumental for economic growth and risk—sharing in Europe. I am glad that ESMA is empowered to report on undue costs and to act against misleading fund names. However, I’m not as glad as I could have been with a more ambitious approach, weighting partly in the retail package, and that would have been to stop—rent seeking, protect investors, bring down the fees and support the European capital markets. My last words of thanks are for the rapporteur: you’ve done excellent work in bringing forward the Parliament’s position. Thank you for that.",S&D,2024-02-06,18.

Mairead McGuinness,"Mr President, thank you to the rapporteur Benjumea, the shadow rapporteurs and colleagues who are interested in this debate. If you look at the title with the acronyms, maybe it doesn’t show what’s so important. So, for the record, what I want to do is read out what these directives are, because they are two key laws that govern the EU investment sector. One is the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) and the second the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive (UCITSD). So both are highly important. The investment fund sector plays a pivotal role in the European economy, with total assets under management reaching nearly EUR 20 trillion, and there are more than 4800 asset management companies operating in Europe. The sector has continued to grow over the last few years, so it is a hugely significant sector in terms of the financing it can offer the European economy and, of course, its importance for the Capital Markets Union, but also in terms of what is always a core aim, maintaining financial stability. The agreement that you have reached makes really important progress on both of these points. It will improve access to additional sources of financing for EU companies. It will strengthen the protections for investors that choose to invest in these various types of investment funds, and it will also help us monitor and manage financial stability risks. So just to mention some of the specifics of the reform. Firstly, it introduces a harmonised list of liquidity management tools, and this will equip fund managers with a toolkit to better respond to liquidity stresses. And that will play an important role in improving the resilience of EU funds. Secondly, there are new rules on loan-originating funds. This is an important step towards establishing an alternative source of funding, particularly for our SMEs. And finally, thanks to Parliament, we are introducing additional safeguards for retail investors. We hope that this will increase retail investor participation in capital markets. In particular, we share the goal that costs should not be excessive or unduly charged to investors. ESMA’s report on undue costs will help assess the cost charged to investors, and it will set the tone for further work in this area. In addition, fund managers will be able to appoint an independent director in their management bodies and work will be done to ensure the names of investment funds are not misleading. These are all important steps towards building retail investors’ trust in capital markets. We can look forward to ESMA’s work to establish a uniform set of implementing rules. It has taken us a while, as you know, colleagues, to get here – almost two years of very intense discussion and for political trilogues – but the efforts of Parliament have made a huge contribution towards this ambitious outcome. And so I therefore look forward tomorrow to your vote. Before I finish, can I just particularly thank our rapporteur – I think we are eye-to-eye here, dear Isabel Benjumea – for both your support, your ambition and your tireless work in good cooperation on this file.

Global Gateway has begun delivering concrete results on the ground from Africa to the Indo-Pacific to Latin America and the Caribbean. We have worked towards the Sustainable Development Goals and to the just green and digital transitions, so critical. We have strengthened partnerships around the world while upholding the universal values we hold most dear, and we have increased Europe’s resilience and geopolitical standing in the process. Looking ahead, Global Gateway will take up even more speed. We will need to boost major initiatives that can have the greatest transformational impact, such as the Trans-Caspian Corridor, Lobito Corridor and green shipping corridors. We must continue to mobilise private sector partners, the financial engine behind Global Gateway’s success, and we must work together to continue increasing visibility in Member States, partner countries and multilateral fora. In a contested and rapidly evolving world, the Global Gateway builds resilience for the EU and our international partners alike. We need to get this message out together. Dear President, dear Members, thank you once again for your interest and cooperation on this important issue.

Barry Andrews,"Mr President, the Commission cites democratic values as the first core principle of the Global Gateway policy. But I am struggling to see how this initiative is democratic. Firstly, it was not conceived in a democratic way, with the European Parliament frozen out of the implementation of the policy, and the responsible Commissioner has never appeared in this Parliament to account for the implementation of the policy. Secondly, I do not see how the policy is supposed to foster democracy. Only 2 of the 46 partner countries can be considered high-performance democracies. So what we are left with is the naive hope that economic growth fosters some kind of democratic spirit. We know from the histories of China, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other countries that this is a myth. And thirdly, we have a business advisory group which has met now with 60 members, some connected with the Chinese state and none of them from the Global South. So we need – and I agree with Ms González in this regard – more transparency, we need more community development agreements, and we need stronger conditionality.

David McAllister,"Mr President, in a globalised world, trans—regional infrastructure projects have become an integral part of international relations, and we all know billions and billions of euros are lacking annually to meet the United Nations Development Goals. Indeed, it was Commission President Ursula von der Leyen who recognised the signs of the time and launched the prestige project Global Gateway in December 2021. With that, the European Union has started to fill the global infrastructure financing gap with targeted offers. I would like to thank Commissioner Johansson for presenting and naming a number of flagship projects all around the globe, which are examples that Global Gateway is starting to deliver. However, we all know there is plenty of competition. By the end of last year, 146 countries, including 17 EU Member States, had signed memorandums of understanding with China to become part of the Belt and Road Initiative. Not only do projects of the Belt and Road often come paired with allegations of corruption or environmental damage, they can also lead participating countries into a debt spiral. This is starting to cause serious mistrust in Africa, in Latin America and in Asia. The European Union must not squander this opportunity. The inaugural Gateway Forum on 25 and 26 of October 2023 in Brussels gave our partners a clearer idea of how this initiative functions and how they can participate in it. To match the political commitment, we now need to mobilise the firepower of the private sector. Public funds alone will not be able to generate the levels of investment needed.

Ylva Johansson,"Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for this opportunity to update you on Global Gateway. From increased geopolitical tensions to climate disasters to the soaring global infrastructure investment gap – the times are challenging for Europe and for the world. Facing so much instability, the need for the EU to increase resilience for Europe and partner countries has grown stronger. And most importantly, the EU has shown that it is not turning its back on its partners. Not today, not tomorrow. The Global Gateway investment strategy is Europe’s EUR 300-billion injection to accelerate the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. And Global Gateway is delivering. Last year, we started 87 Global Gateway flagship projects. To give just one example, in Namibia, a EUR 1-billion Team Europe partnership to decarbonise their economies and create jobs is taking place. Together, we will unleash Namibia’s potential as a frontrunner in green energy and help Europe to become the first carbon-neutral continent by 2050. This example illustrates the kind of comprehensive, quality-based partnership that distinguishes Global Gateway from other partnership offers. Let me draw your attention to six key achievements last year. First, the EU-CELAC summit in July. We agreed on a EUR 45-billion investment agenda that reinvigorates Europe’s partnership with Latin America and the Caribbean. It ranged from tropical forest protection in Brazil to the deployment of 5G in Costa Rica. Second, in October, the EU welcomed more than 20 heads of state, 70 ministers and industry and financial sector leaders to Brussels for the first Global Gateway Forum. In two days, we signed more than EUR 3 billion in new agreements. Third, in addition to the Global Gateway Governing Board, with the participation of the European Parliament, we continue to operate operationalise the Global Gateway governance structure with key stakeholders. We held the first ever meetings of the business advisory group and the civil society and local authorities dialogue platform. Fourth, we worked with Member States, the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to define the Global Gateway financial monitoring methodology. We will track the progress on our EUR 300-billion investments by 2027 in transparency, as you requested. Fifth, we mobilised private sector finance, organising more than a dozen Global Gateway business forums in partner countries and numerous events in Brussels. And, last but not least, we made Global Gateway visible. We organised joint Team Europe Global Gateway missions to Namibia, to the DRC, to Zambia, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico. And we showcased Global Gateway in the G7 Hiroshima summit, the G20 summit and in COP28. Honourable Members of this Parliament, this success in 2023 was truly a collaborative effort of all Team Europe actors. Looking ahead, Global Gateway will deliver even more results this year, with 138 flagship projects and a focus on key areas recommended by the Global Gateway Board. Delivering on them will require true teamwork. I look forward to the continued cooperation with the European Parliament. IN THE CHAIR: MARC ANGEL Vice-President",-,2024-02-06,17.

We will continue to condemn actions that impede the democratic aspirations of the Venezuelan people, particularly the obstruction of their representatives from participating in the elections. The European Union will continue monitoring closely the human rights situation in Venezuela, including the issue of political prisoners. The EU will review the sanctions in place depending on the evolution of the situation in the country, including the implementation of the Barbados Agreement.

Ylva Johansson,"Mr President, I thank you, Members of the European Parliament. Thank you for your strong support to the Venezuelan people, to democracy, to the rule of law. Recent events in Venezuela clearly indicate the fragility of the agreements reached in Barbados. Therefore, we must continue to support the ongoing dialogue between the government and the opposition in coordination with our international and regional partners. While the dialogue process faces numerous obstacles and persistent threats, it remains the only route capable of ensuring peace and stability in Venezuela in the run-up to this year’s presidential elections. We recognise the overwhelming support achieved by Maria Corina Machado as the main opposition representative for the 2024 presidential elections. The EU continues to be very concerned about decisions that prevent members of the opposition from exercising their basic political right, as has been the case with Maria Corina Machado and Henrique Capriles. These decisions undermine democracy and the rule of law, and only further deepen the protracted political and social crisis in Venezuela. Only a peaceful and democratic solution, led by Venezuelans themselves, will allow for the restoration of political stability, economic growth and social well-being for the millions of Venezuelans currently in need. The humanitarian crisis in Venezuela is of utmost concern, and addressing the human rights situation in the country must be at the forefront of our collective efforts.

Ylva Johansson,"Mr President, honourable Members of Parliament, Minister, 2024 is the decisive electoral year for Venezuela. It is the moment to put the interests of Venezuelans above everything else, and to work towards credible and inclusive elections. The October 2023 political agreement signed in Barbados between the government and the opposition was a positive step in that direction, as was the liberation of a number of political prisoners in December. But as you know, unfortunately this has been overshadowed by recent developments. The political repression with arrest warrants against members of the opposition culminated last week with the Venezuelan Supreme Court of Justice confirming the ineligibility of two popular opposition leaders: María Corina Machado, who won the opposition’s presidential primary, and Henrique Capriles. These rulings prevent members of the opposition from exercising their core political rights and compromise the very essence of democratic participation, undermining democracy and the rule of law. The European Union has already publicly expressed its concern and has called for the full implementation of the Barbados Agreement and for the continuation of an inclusive dialogue process leading to credible, inclusive and transparent elections in Venezuela in this year. Honourable Members, the people of Venezuela deserve an electoral process that reflects their aspirations and ensures their active participation. Democracy is not merely about casting votes – it’s about fostering an environment where citizens can freely engage in civic matters without fear of prosecution. Governments could never be free to choose their electoral opponents, no more than they could be permitted to rig the outcome of the elections. The EU stands ready to support Venezuelan democracy in this crucial year, including through the deployment of an electoral observation mission for the 2024 presidential elections – if formally invited by the Venezuelan authorities. The final decision would depend on the evolution of the situation in the country and electoral conditions, in particular the participation of the opposition. If these elections do not take place in conditions where their results can be recognised by the Venezuelan people as well as the international community, it would mean that the political crisis that started in 2015 will continue to deteriorate, and neither the Venezuelan people nor their neighbours could bear this. As to the targeted restrictive measures in place until May 2024, as indicated by the Council, the EU will review these measures in light of developments on the ground and the implementation of the political agreements. The European Union will continue to support a democratic and peaceful solution that comes from Venezuelans themselves and puts an end to the complex crisis in the country. Venezuela must return to the democratic path, starting by holding credible, inclusive and transparent presidential elections in 2024.",-,2024-02-06,16.

Nicolas Schmit,"Mr President, honourable Members, well, all the young people who have listened to this debate have understood that there is nearly a consensus that they deserve a fair treatment when they are a trainee. And that’s why it is – I agree – now time to act. I was asked, ‘What does it mean, an initiative?’ Well, an initiative means a legal proposal. Being a directive and as we have – and I never hid that – some treaty constraints, we have to associate the directive with a recommendation, which is not my wish, my ideal situation, but also I would say the Commission, at first, is bound by the Treaty text. Now, I think that your debate showed different aspects of this important issue. First, it is indeed a question also of dignity, of respect for young people. It is a question of social justice because those who do not have parents who can pay cannot go for a traineeship, and their situation on the labour market will not be improved by that. It is a question of equal access, therefore, but also it has been said by somebody we are in a period where there are permanent complaints – and rightly so by the way – about shortage of talents, shortage of skilled labour. Well, I would tell you, if there is a company, an employer that doesn’t pay their traineeships, they are not attractive employers, and no young people should be attracted to go there for a definite work. So it is in the interest also of all employers to really respect young people, respect trainees and pay them adequately. And that’s why we have to put an end to these endless traineeships. In Germany, we talked about ‘Generation Practica’ – you have mentioned it – and this is something which has to come definitely to an end. Now, we are finalising the legislative proposal. It will come. It has to take into account some constraints which we have in the Treaty, and I thank the Parliament for the insistence and the commitment on this particular important issue for young people. But I say also to Member States that they should take care and that they should really ensure that also for young people, all work deserves pay.",-,2024-02-06,15.

Cyrus Engerer,"Mr President, I am glad to belong to the socialist group, which has taken the lead to push for an ambitious directive on quality traineeships. Mr Commissioner, I rely on you to give this message to President von der Leyen – we need to tell her that the time to act is now. We cannot wait any further because all young people should have the opportunity to get experiences in the institutions, and not only those who have parents who can finance them while they’re working here in this Parliament or in other institutions, in what some can experience something which is very similar to modern slavery. Traineeships should not be only for the privileged youth. They should be for everyone. And as we are speaking of this, even in this Parliament, how can it be possible that even today trainees cannot rent the bicycles that we all get for free? Members, assistants, advisers, everyone who works in this Parliament can get bicycles for free, but trainees have to pay for bicycles outside of this European Parliament, while the rest of us get them for free, and they are the least paid in the European Parliament. I was so happy to invite 100 young people, one every week during this mandate, to join me here in this Parliament, all being paid for coming here. And I’m so glad that, out of this, now one is running for the European Parliament elections, and many of them are running for local council elections, because once we give young people the opportunity, the sky is the limit.

Seán Kelly,"A Uachtaráin, a Choimisinéir, quality traineeships play a pivotal role in integrating young people into the labour market. The transition from education to employment is fraught with difficulties for our youth, and it is imperative that we address these obstacles collectively. Despite progress in recent years, there remain significant hurdles. Notably, the number of young individuals gaining long traineeships has decreased. Furthermore, while the percentage of paid traineeships has increased, it is disheartening that nearly half of the trainees across the EU continue to go unpaid, undermining the financial stability of our emerging workforce. Quality traineeships are instrumental in bridging the gap between education and employment. However, these persisting issues threaten to discourage talented individuals and exacerbate existing inequalities. We need to incentivise and promote paid traineeships, increase the overall number of traineeships, and encourage collaboration between educational institutions, businesses and government bodies.

Lívia Járóka,"Mr President, dear colleagues, honourable Commissioner, in November 2023 we approved the resolution, with recommendations to the Commission, on quality traineeships, requesting more funding and stronger implementation for the Member States. Roma youth, whom I represent, are especially desperate for more opportunities because about 83% of Roma children are at risk of poverty, especially now, after the war and also the COVID situation. About 52% of them still go to segregated classes. The EU, with the Spanish Presidency, has made a big step on desegregation, but we have to go further. In Hungary a few years ago, we started to develop programmes for Roma children in afternoon schools, after school, and we paired them with music and talent support programmes – for example football and different sports projects. These were talent support programmes. EU programmes such as Horizon and Erasmus Plus are great and affordable opportunities for these students coming from very, very low strata of the European Union. We already have teachers and researchers who could be working on these projects. But in Hungary, for example, Erasmus placement opportunities are very limited now because we don’t get the monies, so the programmes are stopping.

Virginijus Sinkevičius,"Mr President, honourable Members, let me welcome the strong involvement and frequent debates of the Parliament on the topic of water. It is a vital issue because five of the last six years in Europe have been exceptionally dry, and this has caused significant economic damage to agriculture, energy and inland navigation worth some EUR 9 billion every year, and the latest climate projections suggest that, in the extreme scenario of 3°C of warming, the resulting damage could cost up to EUR 40 billion per year. The water emergency in parts of Spain and other parts of the EU is a particular cause of concern, but water scarcity is no longer confined to the Mediterranean region. More and more regions of Europe, including even rainy regions like Flanders, now face similar problems, and this new normal includes prolonged droughts followed by devastating floods, sometimes in the same region. In the face of these changes, we need a different approach. We need to work towards a water-resilient Europe, a Europe better equipped to adapt to the water challenges of today and tomorrow, leaving no one behind. This entails a systemic transformation of the way water is managed, used and valued, while always bearing in mind the need to protect nature and ecosystems. This is also a precondition for the Union’s strategic autonomy and its green transition in relation to affordable energy, food security, industrial production and intergenerational fairness. This is one reason why, as announced by President von der Leyen, the Commission is putting forward a water resilience initiative in March. The initiative will combine a series of immediate actions with the launch of a broad, transparent public debate that will involve EU institutions, Member States and all relevant stakeholders such as local and regional authorities, the private sector, NGOs, academia and citizens at large. We know where additional action is needed: the EU has already delivered robust water legislation. If it were respected in full, many elements of the current crisis would be far less pressing. Better implementation of the EU acquis is therefore a top priority. A lot has been done under this mandate to spur further action, improving water quality and water ecosystems, and in particular throughout the biodiversity strategy and the zero pollution action plan. Today, too often we tend to address water scarcity and drought through ad-hoc emergency measures. We need to move to more systemic advanced planning of drought risk reduction. Currently, only 14 Member States have drawn up proper drought management plans, while droughts occur in every EU Member State. In addition to better planning, we also need more accurate data. That is why the Commission founded the European Drought Observatory in 2009 to systematically collect data on water scarcity. Last November, the Observatory published a pan-European drought risk atlas and a pan-European drought impact database, and these new databases map future drought risk and make predictions region by region. However, we need to do more: we need to realise that water quantity and water quality are two sides of the same coin. Success will depend on tackling head on all the pressures faced by our vulnerable water resources, and that means tackling pollution at source, it means reducing the over-abstraction and over-allocation of water. It means safeguarding minimum ecological flows in our rivers, allowing them to provide the ecosystem services that we rely on. It also means combating illegal abstraction with full deployment of technological solutions. We also need to ensure that heavy water users, like the digital and energy sectors, internalise water efficiency and water protection. It also requires more rigorous application of the ‘cost recovery’ principle with water pricing policies based on the ‘polluter pays’ principle. This will incentivise water savings and pollution prevention measures while ensuring it remains affordable to all. In all cases, we should start with efforts to reduce demand. Before looking for fresh supplies, we should start with water efficiency, mirroring the ‘efficiency first’ principle for energy, which now guides business decisions and investments. This is fully in line with the circular economy approach: our collective focus should begin with stimulating water efficiency and water reuse across the lifecycle of processes and products. Leakages and drinking water supply systems must also be addressed. Across the EU, an average of 23 % of treated water is now lost during distribution, and with the new obligations in the recast Drinking Water Directive, Member States have the tools they need to assess leakage rates and develop targeted actions to reduce the losses. The proposal for a recast Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive encourages the reuse of treated wastewater in agriculture, and that should receive an additional boost from the recent entry into application of the Water Reuse Regulation, helping limit freshwater abstraction from surface and groundwater bodies. But legislation alone will not solve these problems, and exit from the crisis will require firm action on many sides, and for that we also need to scale up and upgrade our investment in water. In the current financial period, the European Union has significantly increased its support to help co-fund water-related infrastructure through instruments like the ERDF and RRF. Adapting to the likely scenario of future water scarcity is the smartest economic move, and if we fail to act today, the cost of inaction will be far higher in the future. Adaptation is essential, but we must remain equally committed to climate mitigation. You just had a debate, so today the Commission launched the dialogue to establish an interim 2040 climate target, setting the EU firmly on a path towards climate neutrality by 2050. Honourable Members, let me conclude by highlighting once again the importance of sustainable, resilient water management and of protecting the quality and quantity of fresh water. By increasing the resilience of our water system and the sectors that rely on it, we move away from crisis management and we move towards the proactive management of risks, and that’s the best way to help our citizens today, that’s the best way to help our farmers, and that’s the best way to minimise the risk for the water-stressed citizens for tomorrow.

Nicolas Schmit,"Madam President, honourable Members, young Europeans are the most educated generation to date. Their talent, skills and ideas will shape Europe’s future. At the same time, our global economy is characterised by uncertainty and unprecedented fast changes. Helping young people gain a foothold in the rapidly evolving labour markets therefore remains a priority for this Commission. We have delivered a reinforced Youth Guarantee, a modernised European framework for vocational education and training and a new impetus for apprenticeships. Together with Parliament, we put the social dimension at the heart of the European Year of Youth and the ongoing European Year of Skills. The Commission is committed to continuing to strengthen bridges that bring young people to the labour market, notably by exploiting the potential of hands-on, work-based learning. Traineeships are an important pathway for young people to access the labour market. Traineeships can provide a unique opportunity to learn on the job and to practically prepare for the world of work. They help improve their skills and increase their employability, and we see that trainees increasingly find traineeships in another Member States. So, I’m really a bit shocked when some people talk about the cost of traineeships. The cost of traineeships. What an absurd approach to what should be considered to be the benefit of traineeships. Because the benefit of traineeships is not just about trainees; it’s not just about young people. It’s also about companies. Those who benefit from traineeships are also intelligent companies who give young people an opportunity and profit and take use of their knowledge, of their commitment and also of their sense of innovation. These are contributions to companies who benefit from these young people. That’s why traineeships have to be paid. They should not be just for free. It’s a way to recognise the contribution of young people. It’s also a form of respect for young people. That’s why also, I’m sure, many companies pay and those who do not pay should change their behaviour. Therefore, this Parliament has rightly stressed, by an overwhelming majority, that traineeships must be of quality and come with fair working conditions, including pay and a proper learning experience. And they should be accessible to all. This was also a clear call by the Conference on the Future of Europe and youth organisations, and we are heeding this call. Traineeships should not be a means of depriving people of their rights at work, or of replacing regular jobs. We need to combat precarious traineeships, not promote them. The Commission is currently preparing an initiative to update the EU Quality Framework for Traineeships to be presented before the end of this Parliament’s term. We absolutely share the goals set out by Parliament, and we will do our utmost to meet Parliament’s requests while respecting – and we have no choice here – the boundaries set by the Treaties. This will be the Commission’s response to the Parliament’s legislative own-initiative resolution.

Michael Gahler,"Mr President, colleagues, shanovni Ukraintsi. Ten years of war, two years of full—scale war waged by a war criminal in the Kremlin. The Ukrainian nation stands united and refuses to be subjugated back into the servitude of a Russian gulag. The EU also stands united behind Ukraine, and we are not alone, if we look at the Rammstein format of almost 50 states that help in multifaceted ways. I am proud, as standing rapporteur for Ukraine and as a co-rapporteur for the Ukraine Facility, that we concluded the Trilogue on the Ukraine Facility yesterday evening as part of the revised Multiannual Financial Framework.

Rasa Juknevičienė,"Mr President, first of all, thank you for your strong leadership. Ukraine has shown a miracle. Let’s remember the first weeks. How many here believed that Ukraine would stop the Russians at Kyiv? Two years of this war have also shown a miracle of European unity. We know what we have already done by standing together. Today, we have to talk and agree on what is needed to win this war. First of all, the front needs even more support now, today, this particular minute. Second, we must believe that we can win this war. We, the democratic world, are many times stronger than Russia. The economic power is incomparable. However, the EU-wide support to Ukraine is only 0.075% of GDP per year. Is it really an indicator that shows our understanding of Europe’s existential war? Third, we must not be afraid of Russia, just as the Ukrainians are not afraid. We must not be afraid of Putin’s blackmail and the defeat of his regime. Putin must lose. Fourth, we need a comprehensive plan for the victory of Ukraine. This requires a vast development of the EU defence industry. Now is the time for the European Union to get its act together on security. A defence union is needed as never before. But I see such a union only together with Ukraine, with Ukraine, in the EU and in NATO, with its army, which is clearly the strongest army in Europe today. The victory of Ukraine will be the victory of the whole Europe. Only victory can solve the historic eastern dilemma in Europe. Slava Ukraini! Long live Europe!",PPE,2024-02-06,"3.

Ursula von der Leyen,"Mr President, Ms Minister, honourable Members, in any fight, it is always the side fighting for something that has a higher power on its side. It is the one who believes in what they are fighting for that will sacrifice and do what it takes to prevail. Conversely, it is the side who fights against something that will always be scared. Scared to lose, scared to think of the future, scared to speak out. Two years ago, Putin and Russia started a war against something, a war against Ukraine and its territory, but also against the people and a nation with an iron will and hope for the future; against their European aspirations; against the values they share with us; and quite simply, against both modern reality and the strong tides of European history. In doing so, Putin started a fight against all of us, against freedom, self-determination and democracy at large; against everything that we have stood for over 70 years. Ukraine has proven the power of a nation and a people fighting for something. For themselves first and foremost, but also for us and for everything that we believe in: freedom, democracy, rights and aspirations. Some were surprised by Ukraine’s heroic action. But no one should have been surprised that, when faced with oppression, subjugation and tyranny, they chose resistance. That is why, honourable Members, I remain just as convinced of one simple fact today than I was two years ago standing in front of you. That is that Ukraine will prevail and that Europe will stand with Ukraine every step of the way. Honourable Members, we have spoken in great detail over the last two years on the EU’s historic and massive support for Ukraine – be it military, financial or human; be it on sanctions, security or the single market; be it on the historic path of Ukraine to our Union that this House has been such a strong supporter of. But today, on this poignant anniversary debate, it is time to look deeper at how we have got there and where we must go. The starting point is that Ukraine – and Europe – have shown that we are willing to fight and pay the ultimate price for the things that we believe in. This was one of Putin’s greatest miscalculations in that month of February, as he amassed troops on the border and planned a quick lightning strike on Kyiv. Mr Putin, you made this mistake because you cannot understand what drives the human spirit when it is free to think, dream, create and prosper. Nor can you understand, because you cannot bear to accept that the human desire for freedom will always win. Honourable Members, Putin cannot understand that if you give people a choice, they choose liberty once and for all. In Ukraine’s case, they fight for liberation. He cannot understand that the fight of the Ukrainian is different to the fight of a Russian soldier, whose lives Putin has callously churned for a past long gone and a future that could never exist. Ukraine’s sacrifice is the opposite. Why do they fight? Because they are battling, toiling, for something existential and inherent to the human condition. This is why Ukraine’s will is not just stronger than Russia’s. It is fundamentally different in nature and in character. This is what Putin will never comprehend about us. This is why his invasion was not just morally, but also strategically, wrong. He cannot understand freedom and why we fight for it, because his only instinct is to crush what he fears. This explains what has happened in the last two years. Instead of toppling Kyiv, dividing the European Union and weakening NATO, the exact opposite has happened on each and every count. With the support of the European Union and our allies, Ukraine has not only held firm against a bigger country, a bigger army and a bigger economy, but it has retaken more than half of the territory that Russia occupied from the start of this conflict. They have knocked back Russian offensives last winter and are doing the same now. This indomitable spirit is what we have to keep in mind here in Europe and right across the democratic world at this juncture of the war. There’s no time for wavering. There’s no time for navel-gazing. The message Europe sent at last week’s European Council was crystal clear. Let me repeat it here. Europe will be at Ukraine’s side for every single day of this war, and for every single day thereafter. Honourable Members, we must keep up our momentum to support Ukraine and to protect our own future. That means thinking about reconstruction, about security commitments, about strengthening the international system to avoid any repeats or reruns. It also means continuing to support Ukraine in every way we can. Take military support. So far, we have trained over 40 000 Ukrainian soldiers. Our Union and Member States have mobilised EUR 28 billion worth of military equipment. The European defence industry has increased its production capacity for ammunition by 40 %. We will have delivered over half a million rounds of artillery shells by next month, more than 1 million by the end of the year. But this is certainly not enough. Not only must we accelerate the delivery of ammunition to Ukraine, but as we look to the future, we must think of Ukraine’s defence capabilities as part of our defence capabilities. We must think of Ukraine’s defence industry as part of our own defence industry. This is why we have involved Ukraine in the preparations of our own Defence Industrial Strategy. It is a first step, which should lead to integrating Ukraine in some of our defence programmes, with the agreement of the European Parliament and Council where necessary. This would not only help us cater for Ukraine’s defence needs, it will also encourage convergence and joint planning between our militaries and defence industries. Ukraine is a future member of our European Union, so it must get much closer to us, also in the field of defence. This leads me to my third and last point on Ukraine’s path towards our Union. The contrast with just ten years ago couldn’t be starker. Back then, a pro-Russia regime in Ukraine was passing authoritarian laws and killing protesters on the streets. Today, this country has just given itself new legislation to expand national minority rights, to improve the judicial system, and to ensure checks and balances on power. This is what led us to launching the accession negotiations. This progress is happening not only because Europe is asking for it. This is the deep desire of the people of Ukraine. Ukraine is Europe, because Europe is in the hearts and in the minds of Ukrainians. Soon enough, Ukraine will also be in our Union. Honourable Members, the anniversary that we mark today is a tragic loss of human lives and suffering, and it is all the more tragic as we know there will be more pain and more suffering ahead. We know how much is at stake here for those in Ukraine and also for the rest of Europe. Putin’s fantasy and fabricated war, and Ukraine’s heroic resistance, has reminded us here that our freedoms and our democracy are worth fighting for. So today, we pay tribute to those who are fighting, and we pay tribute to those who paid the ultimate sacrifice in fighting for something. Slava Ukraini!",-,2024-02-06,"3.

President,"The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements and the motions for resolutions on the need for unwavering EU support for Ukraine, after two years of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. Dear colleagues, two years ago, the world order was upended by Russia’s illegal invasion of sovereign, independent Ukraine. They thought they could take Kyiv in a matter of days. They miscalculated the determination of the Ukrainian people and they underestimated the resolve of the European Union and the international community. Ukraine has inspired, and continues to inspire, the world. A few weeks after the initial invasion I spoke in the name of the Members of the European Parliament, in Kyiv, in front of the Verkhovna Rada and beside President Zelenskyy. I made a promise on behalf of all us: that we would stand with Ukraine and its people for as long as it takes. In the last two years, Europe has kept that promise. We will keep that promise still. Our political, economic, military, financial, humanitarian and diplomatic support has remained steadfast. The European Union is the largest financial supporter of Ukraine with EUR 88  billion provided so far. We are ramping up our EU defence industry’s production capacity to provide Ukraine with over 1 million artillery rounds by the end of the year. An agreement on the additional EUR 50 billion Ukraine Facility, pending agreement on the Multiannual Financial Framework, was also reached last night – funding that is crucial for Ukraine’s survival, recovery, and reconstruction. We know the sacrifice that the Ukrainian people are enduring. We know they endure it for their sake and for all of Europe, for our collective security, for our shared values, for our way of life. The European Parliament was the first to call for Ukraine to receive EU candidate status and we were the strongest advocate for EU accession negotiations to start last year. Because we know that Ukraine’s place is within our Union. As we enter the third year of Russia’s war on aggression on Ukraine, I want to use this moment to renew the promise that we made to the Ukrainian people: we are with you and we will remain with you.

Alfred Sant,"With the Commission in tow, the European Council has again shown itself adept in overriding tactical challenges to major issues that needed to be cleared, this time the settlement of the EU’s financial commitment to the Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression. However, such tactical deftness really amounts to kicking the can up the road. There is no glimmer as to what Europe would consider an acceptable ending to the Russia-Ukraine war, or what should be the long-term vision for an EU-Russia entente, with or without Putin. Similarly, on the Israeli-Hamas war, the EU position remains, at best, incoherent. Regarding how internal EU priorities are taking shape, the contradictions emerging between the environmental reach of the Green Deal and the social and economic consequences that follow from it require strategic clearance. Instead, as with the turmoil in the agricultural sector, approaches take the form of hesitant half steps backwards. Meanwhile, the medium-term financial options by which to finance the decisions being taken remain obscure. In all this, the European Parliament should be a voice that emphasises the need to achieve clarity of purpose. Whatever is being done in this direction is not effective. Quite likely, the can will continue to be kicked up the road.",S&D,2024-02-06,"2.

Maroš Šefčovič,"Madam President, Mr President of the European Council, honourable Members, first and foremost, I would like to thank all of the honourable Members, starting with the leaders of the political groups, who underscored that the last week, and indeed the last European Council, were good for Europe. Unwavering European support for Ukraine was underlined by significant financial assistance of EUR 50 billion Facility. We believe that, with your approval, we will be able to make important first payments to Ukraine as early as in March. On top of this very important decision, the European Council also agreed on the first-ever revision of our multiannual budget. It will help us, as stated by Mr Mureșan, to step up, fight against irregular migration, better protect our borders, respond to natural disasters in the European Union – which are on the dramatic rise, as we have seen over the last summer – but also to fund a better Western Balkans Growth Plan, and engage with our southern neighbourhood, and also provide important humanitarian assistance, which is so much needed, as we have seen in Gaza. I am particularly glad that now we can use our European Platform for Strategic Technologies (STEP) to support critical technologies made in Europe. Together we have achieved a solution that corresponds to 80 % of needed funding, which is, in the current situation and under current circumstances, truly remarkable. At the same time, this also demonstrates, as was highlighted by several Members of the European Parliament – Mr Mureșan, Mr Fernandes, Mr Glucksmann – that the next multiannual financial perspective, our budget for the seven years, must really reflect the new geopolitical situation, growing tasks for the European Union, and fierce geo-economic competition, where we would need funding for research and innovation, clean and green tech, so we would have the necessary financial resources to deliver on all these priorities. Ms Marques and Ms Hayer spoke about strategic autonomy, and I believe as it is the priority for this Commission that it will be also priority for the next one, and I hope that it will remain priority for the European Parliament as well. Many honourable Members referred to farmers and agriculture, and we will have a dedicated debate on agriculture tomorrow. So, let me now just underscore our utmost respect for farmers and foresters, our understanding for the difficult situation, and our readiness to engage, to listen to them and to look for constructive solutions. We believe that through the launch of Strategic Dialogue on the Future of Agriculture we will bring a new consensus, that we will overcome the polarisation on this matter, and develop new approaches to be reflected in the next cycle of multiannual financial perspective and CAP. So, let’s listen to each other, let’s build bridges and let’s work on our new consensus.",-,2024-02-06,"2.

Siegfried Mureşan,"Madam President, President von der Leyen, President Michel, Vice-President Šefčovič, dear colleagues. Congratulations, President Michel, to you and to the Members of the Council for unanimously reaching an agreement on the revision of the multiannual financial framework and on granting EUR 50 billion to Ukraine. The message from this Council is clear: Europe is delivering, Europe stays united and Europe continues to support Ukraine for as much as is needed. The conclusion is also obvious: when Europe is united, populists have no chance. This revision of the multiannual financial framework was needed because when the multiannual financial framework was decided, the Council at the time made two mistakes: it adopted a framework that was too small, it did not have enough resources for the traditional and for the new priorities of the Union, and it did not have enough reserves for unexpected developments. This mistake had to be corrected. The second mistake made was that it did foresee the repayment of interest payments for NextGenerationEU from inside the budget but, of course, the budget is meant to support farmers, researchers, students and to better protect our borders. It is not meant to pay back interest payments. These two mistakes made in the past we are now managing together to correct to a large extent: we are going to better protect our borders, we are going to allocate significant resources to this new challenge – migration and border control. We are going to support Ukraine and the immediate neighbourhood and we are also protecting our industry. We are going to do this together. The conclusion also for the future is: involve Parliament fast in the process. It cannot be that the Council takes eight months to reach a proposal, and then expects Parliament to agree to it in 80 days. We are committed to working fast on it now, we are going to deliver, we are going to give our vote soon. But for the future, the conclusion needs to be clear: we need to work on this together and put forward budgets which are enough at the beginning of the period so that such revisions do not hastily become needed.",PPE,2024-02-06,"2.

We know that this support is only a small step, given the total needs and the declining support from the US. It is crucial that we keep delivering. But exactly this will remain threatened by Orbán. He is utterly disloyal towards NATO, the EU and the European values. But while leaders were focusing on convincing Orbán, they failed to secure our strategic autonomy – no investments in Europe’s green transformation and even cuts in innovation funds. Chair, the only long-term answer to this autocrat is to disarm him, take away his voting rights, keep EU funding frozen and cancel the Council presidency.

This is a deeply broken system, and I would certainly laugh at it were it not quite literally a matter of life and death.

And for a month, the Council was stuck on a package equivalent to 0.08% of our yearly GDP. This should be a no brainer. Not just morally speaking, but logically too.

They know nothing will happen to them. Why would it, if Orbán can blackmail us with no consequence? Spain is the case in point.

Terry Reintke,"Madam President, dear colleagues, it’s true, last week was a good week for Europe, but after the European Council meeting, I honestly ask myself ‘why only now?’ All of this could have already been done in December. If there is one lesson to draw from this meeting, I think it is pretty clear that Orbán alone is weaker than the 26 together. This might seem like an obvious information, but apparently it did not reach the 26 EU leaders before last week. For the future, colleagues, and also to the EU leaders, let us not run into these situations again and again and again. The 26 must find the courage to take away the possibility from Orbán to pull stunts against European interests while destroying democracy in Hungary. The case for the Article 7 procedure has been made many times now. We have no time to lose, colleagues. Let us make sure that it is used: to defend the rule of law and fundamental rights; to stand up for the values laid out in Article 2; and, especially now, to make the European Union be ready to act in a changing world full of insecurities. If we run into blackmail vetoes every single time we have to stand by a close ally or we have to act swiftly to defend European interests, it will weaken all of us. This is even more true with regards to Ukraine, to which we owe our unity and reliable support. Ukraine defends our freedom in Europe. It defends it against Russia, a brutal aggressor in the east. We cannot let them wait again like we did this time. This is why now is the moment to do what we should have done for a long time already: to go further on the Article 7 procedure. Und zuletzt: Herr Weber, in einer Sache sind wir uns einig: Wir nehmen die Sorgen der europäischen Bäuerinnen und Bauern sehr ernst. Ich war im letzten Sommer auch vor dem Europäischen Parlament und habe mit den Bauern gesprochen. Aber eine Sache ist mir wichtig: Wir Grüne, wir sagen seit Jahren, dass die europäische Agrarpolitik, wie wir sie seit Jahrzehnten führen, nicht nachhaltig ist – nicht für den Planeten und auch nicht für die Bäuerinnen und Bauern selber.

Deshalb lassen Sie uns jetzt keine populistischen Debatten führen, sondern lassen Sie uns gemeinsam schauen, wie wir die Probleme und die Sorgen der Bäuerinnen und Bauern in Europa gemeinsam adressieren können, während wir natürlich weiterhin dafür kämpfen, dass es Klimaschutz und Artenschutz gibt.

Manfred Weber,"Madam President of the European Parliament, President of the European Commission, President of the European Council, traditionally, a debate about the outcome of a European Council meeting is a moment of criticism. I have to be honest. ‘It’s too slow, it’s too little, it’s too chaotic’. Today, I want to start with a ‘thank you’ because thanks to all the engagements, we achieved the result, we showed unity and we also didn’t allow Viktor Orbán to blackmail the whole European Union. So the result of last week is a good one. There was no option to fail again. And you managed to succeed. The European Council gave a green light to a recovery plan for Ukrainian people. A recovery plan to rebuild the destroyed villages. A recovery plan to put nurses and doctors in hospitals and teachers in schools. A recovery plan to build rehabilitation centres for wounded Ukrainians. And a recovery plan to help Ukraine to do all the key reforms for their European future. And I want to thank all of you for contributing to this. Just as also the Commission President did four years ago with the European Recovery Plan to unite Europe again, to bring Europe on one line, one voice and one goal, Ukraine will win the war and become a new member. And I want to thank Ursula for her leadership in this regard. Orbán came back to Budapest empty handed, or, I still hope, convinced a little bit that threats do not work. The only possible way for him to achieve anything is to work with Europe, not against Europe. And let me also thank in this regard the strong leadership and determination of Donald Tusk. I think it was important last week to have him there and to show a clear direction. Ladies and gentlemen, that is what we achieved now. I was two weeks ago in Kyiv, and what I took away from Kyiv is that they respect and welcome what we are doing there. It gives them hope. It gives them motivation. But they still need a lot from us. And the most important thing they need is the weapons, the ammunition. We have to be faster. We have to deliver all the Taurus missiles from Germany. The end of this war will only come with weapons. Only weapons will shorten the war. Only weapons will tell Putin: ‘Stop! It makes no sense’. Europe’s economy is ten times bigger than Russia’s economy. That’s why we can be successful if we are united and strong. Meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren, lassen Sie mich noch einen zweiten Punkt heute einbringen, und zwar die Diskussion, die uns unsere Bauern auf den Straßen Europas auf den Weg geben. Ich möchte Ursula von der Leyen heute danken für die Botschaften, die sie an die Bäuerinnen und Bauern europaweit gegeben hat. Wir als Europäische Volkspartei verstehen uns als die Bauernpartei Europas. Ich erlebe, dass jetzt viele versuchen, sich als Bauernvertreter zu profilieren. Ich darf daran erinnern, dass wir vor gut neun Monaten hier im Europäischen Parlament Debatten dazu hatten, Bauern bereits hier vor diesem Plenum demonstriert haben. Ich war draußen. Ich habe damals mit den Bauern gesprochen, wie viele Kolleginnen und Kollegen meiner Fraktion. Wir wurden damals im Plenum beschimpft als Bauernlobbyisten – als Bauernlobbyisten, die hier nur ihre Interessen vertreten. Wir haben nur eines gefordert, nämlich: Hört zu, nehmt die Bauern ernst! Und dafür wurden wir beschimpft. Uns war immer klar: Bauern sind Bürger, und sie wollen keine linke Ideologie. Sie wollen ernst genommen werden. Sie wollen beteiligt werden, und sie wollen gute Politik. Und gute Politik startet aus unserer Sicht mit Zuhören, mit Ernstnehmen. Und als Europäische Volkspartei können wir auch Bilanz ablegen. Die verbindliche Flächenstilllegung im Rahmen der Nature-Restoration-Law-Gesetzgebung hätte weniger Nahrungsmittelproduktion in Europa bedeutet. Sie ist jetzt vom Tisch. Und auch die Europäische Union, die heute schon hohe Umweltauflagen hat, wurde mit dem SUR-Vorschlag, mit der SUR-Verordnung, die reine prozentuale Kürzungen vorgesehen hat – eine nicht sinnvolle Regulatorik wäre auf unsere Bauern zugekommen. Und dank auch der Arbeit der EVP ist diese Vorlage jetzt vom Tisch. Wir wollen Artenschutz, wir wollen vorankommen, aber gemeinsam mit den Bauern. Unsere Bauern in Europa sind keine Umweltsünder – nein, sie lieben unsere Natur und kennen sie besser als viele. Unsere Bauern sind keine Tierschänder – nein, sie arbeiten jeden Tag mit ihren Tieren. Unsere Bauern sind keine Agrarlobbyisten – nein, sie helfen den ländlichen Räumen, eine lebenswerte Region zu sein. Und dafür sagen wir als Europäische Volkspartei: Danke! Alle Bauern können sich sicher sein, dass wir auch in Zukunft die Bauernpartei Europas sind. Wir stehen an eurer Seite.",PPE,2024-02-06,"2.

Ursula von der Leyen,"Madam President, dear Roberta, Mr President, dear Charles, Honourable Members. Much of the attention around the Special European Council has indeed focused on our EUR 50 billion Ukraine facility, and rightly so. We are providing Ukraine not only with the funding to keep the economy running, but also with strong predictability for the next four years. This Parliament has backed our proposal from the very beginning. Today, I would like to thank you for your unwavering support. This is what it means to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. With your approval, we will be able to make important payments to Ukraine as early as March. As we will discuss Ukraine in the next debate, allow me to focus on other topics of the Special European Council. The Special European Council also agreed on the first ever – and I emphasise, the first ever – revision of our multiannual budget. It confirmed the priorities that the Commission presented back in June, and I am very satisfied that we got 80 % of the funding we had asked for. We had certainly some difficult choices to make, but we have a very good result now. We will now be able to step up our fight against irregular migration and better protect our external borders. We now have the means to engage even more with the countries of the southern neighbourhood, and I am very glad that the growth plan for the Western Balkans is now on a solid financing footing. We will also be able to improve our response to natural disasters in Member States and to humanitarian crises, such as Gaza. With the Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP), we will support critical technologies that are made in Europe. With this agreement, Europe has the financial resources to tackle some of the main challenges of this decade. I would like to thank the European Parliament for its support so far. Of course, I count on your agreement. Honourable Members, while the European Council was in session, farmers from across Europe were taking to the streets. Many of them feel pushed into a corner. Farmers are the first in line to feel the effects of climate change. Droughts and floods have destroyed their harvests and threatened their livestock. Farmers are feeling the impact of the Russian war – inflation, the rising cost of energy and the rising cost of fertilisers. Nevertheless, they work hard every day to produce the quality food we eat, and for this we owe them appreciation, thanks and respect. It is true that issues have escalated in recent years. Our farmers deserve to be listened to. I know that they are worried about the future of agriculture and about their future as farmers, but they also know that agriculture needs to move to a more sustainable model of production so that their farms remain profitable in the years to come. We want to make sure that the farmers remain in the driving seat in this process. This is why we launched the Strategic Dialogue on the Future of Agriculture in the European Union. We have invited a broad scope of representatives of the farming sectors, the young farmers, the rural communities, the seed and fertiliser industry, the food sector, the processing sector, but also the financial sector, the cooperative banking sector, the consumers and environmental groups, and, of course, science. We need to analyse the situation together, to share ideas and, most importantly, to develop scenarios for the future. We need to move beyond a polarised debate and to create trust. Trust is the crucial basis for viable solutions. There is a lot at stake for all of us. Our European food production system is unique. The products in our supermarkets reflect the variety of our cultures and traditions. Europe has the healthiest and the highest—quality food in the world, thanks to our farmers, who play a central role in this system. Of course, they must be paid fairly for that. It is true that we provide huge support to this sector; our Common Agricultural Policy is supported massively by the EU budget. Money is important, but it is not everything. Healthy natural resources are also key to maintaining high yields, and fertile soils have always been the backbone of our farmers’ livelihoods. We know that 60 to 70 % of soils in Europe are now in poor condition. We can reverse these trends, and many farmers are doing precisely that, but we need to do more now. Effective nature protection must offer generous incentives for intervening. Farmers need a worthwhile business case for nature—enhancing measures. Perhaps we have not made that case convincingly. A real incentive that goes beyond mere loss of yields is required. Public subsidies can provide those incentives and, for example, premium labelling, in cooperation with retailers and processors. In other words, nature conservation can only be successful through a bottom—up and incentive—based approach. Only if our farmers can live off their land will they invest in the future, and only if we achieve our climate and environmental goals together will farmers be able to continue to make a living. Our farmers are well aware of this, and we should place more trust in them. Let me give you one example. The Commission proposed the Sustainable Use Regulation (SUR), which has the worthy aim of reducing the risks of chemical plant protection products. However, the SUR proposal has become a symbol of polarisation. It has been rejected by the European Parliament, and there is no progress anymore in the Council either, so we have to do something. That is why I will propose to the College the withdrawal of this proposal. However, the topic stays, and in order to move forward, more dialogue and a different approach are needed. On this basis, the Commission could make a new proposal with much more mature content and with the stakeholders together. Honourable Members, the months ahead will not be easy, but we have an important opportunity now. It is clear to everyone in this House that our agri—food sector – beginning with the farms – needs long—term prospects and a willingness to listen to each other and to look for common solutions. We need to avoid the blame game and to find solutions for problems together. The report from the Strategic Dialogue of the Future on Agriculture in the European Union is to be tabled by late summer, and it will be enormously important. The results and the recommendations from this dialogue will be discussed in Parliament and with the Member States, and they will form the foundation of our future agricultural policy.",-,2024-02-06,"2.

Clare Daly,"Mr President, the Climate Law is supposed to be our answer to the climate crisis – all-encompassing, supposed to involve all sectors. But there’s always one that we turn a blind eye to: militaries are responsible for about 5.5 % of global greenhouse-gas emissions, more than global aviation and shipping combined. If the global militaries were a country, they’d be the fourth-largest global emitter. Yet we guilt-trip families flying to Spain on their holidays, while all of the time increasing the military carbon bootprint. It’s an absolute joke. It’s totally unfair to exclude military missions from climate targets and reporting when we expect agriculture and other sectors to make cuts. We of course need an ambitious 2040 target, in line with the recommendations of the European Scientific Advisory Board, and we have to tackle this head-on. We can do that by promoting peace and demilitarisation, but instead we’re escalating military expenditure.

It’s been two years of unprecedented help for Ukraine and Ukrainians by the democratic world. But it’s also two years of manoeuvres by opportunistic political leaders who have done a lot not to let Russia be defeated and have not done the right things in the right time. And that policy continues with protecting aggressors’ frozen assets against confiscation and using them to support the victim. It’s a shame that, instead of confiscation, misleading formulas are invented, offering to Ukraine a fraction of what can be given. It’s a shame that the US Congress blocks necessary arms and ammunition supplies, betraying Ukrainian soldiers facing growing Russian pressure.

Helena Dalli,"Mr President, honourable Members, I am grateful for the intense efforts by the European Parliament to make progress on the legislative proposal on plants obtained by new genomic techniques. In particular, I thank the rapporteur, Jessica Polfjärd, for her leadership on this important file. We find ourselves at a critical point in deciding how innovations in plant breeding can make our agri-food system more sustainable, environmentally friendly and globally competitive, and, by extension, how they can address the pressing needs of society and deliver food safety and security. At a time when farmers ask for our support, it is crucial to give them new tools. We need tools that respond to the pressing challenges of breeders and farmers in food production. Farmers are making their voices heard. They want their activities to remain economically viable and globally competitive. We have a responsibility to engage with our farmers, address their concerns and find appropriate solutions. We must also engage genuinely with citizens about how new technologies can help make agriculture more environmentally, socially and economically sustainable. We have listened to the different voices and put forward a balanced set of new rules that are proportionate, contribute to food security and guarantee food safety. I am glad to see that the report proposed by the rapporteur and supported by the ENVI Committee, maintains the overall architecture of our proposal and the need for differentiated requirements based on two categories of plants obtained by new genomic techniques. I remind you that this differentiation is supported by science and allows for a regulatory framework that ensures safety without unnecessary burden. This is key to delivering legislation that enables innovation while not compromising on safety. Legislation to support farmers and their crucial work. Many countries around the world have taken or are taking measures to update their regulatory systems to exploit the potential of new genomic techniques. They are creating regulatory systems adapted to the 21st century. The EU should not miss the opportunity now to do the same. At this stage, the Commission reserves its position on the proposed amendments. We will consider them once Parliament and Council have established their positions and we enter into trilogue discussions. Even so, I shall highlight a couple of issues. On the patentability of plants obtained by new genomic techniques, we have already expressed our commitment to undertake a thorough assessment and, if necessary, take action. I reiterate that commitment today. I understand the legitimate concerns in this area. However, as always, any substantial changes need to be carefully assessed and based on real evidence. I stress how important it is for the Commission in the subsequent discussions to maintain the logic of the proposal as informed by the scientific consensus, namely, that certain plants obtained by new genomic techniques are as safe as conventional plants. They should, in our view, be subject to the same rules as conventional plants, including on risk assessment, traceability, labelling and sustainability. I welcome the progress so far. It paves the way for our joint work in this area. As always, you can count on the Commission’s full support and commitment in the future negotiations.",-,2024-02-06,7.

Videos abound of young men being kidnapped off the streets and forced to the front. Who’s going to fight your war? Corruption is off the charts.

Thomas Waitz,"Mr President, Commissioner, I miss dedication to end fossil fuels until 2040. I also missed an ambition to end fossil subsidies until 2040. I miss a goal of 100 % renewables until 2040, even though renewables are the cheapest form of energy for our citizens and for industry, and they are that form of energy that makes us independent from fossil autocracies. By the way, it keeps the money of energy production in our own economy. I don’t get the point why you’re so much focusing on carbon capture and storage. Your own Advisory Board has told you that this is the most expensive form of collecting CO2. Why not pay the farmers well for sequestering CO2 into the soil? Why not pay them well for changing their methods of production that are climate-friendly and environment-friendly? That would be a low-hanging fruit that is much easier to reach and would also fulfil a lot of other goals, and not serve the industry again with technical solutions behind which they can hide their ongoing fossil extraction.

Ville Niinistö,"Mr President, it’s imperative that we get the 2040 emission reduction target right from the start. That is both for the reality of the climate crisis to address that, but also for the efficient decarbonisation of the European economy. We must learn this from the 2020-2030 discussions. The communication feels, from that viewpoint, that of missed opportunities. The Commission has started with the 90 % target. That was the minimum of the scientific panel. But from there it looks like you have looked too much at short-term fixes instead of maximising action that is really the industrial revolution and the strategic autonomy our economy needs. There is no deadline for fossil fuels. There is no goal of 100 % renewables by 2040. And you’ve made room for nuclear, not at the cost of fossil fuels, but at the cost of renewables. There is too much reliance on CCS, instead of looking at industrial investments that can be long-term solutions that bring also jobs to Europe. On agriculture and forestry, it’s also an economic possibility to invest in carbon farming and not just being quiet about those possibilities.

The priority must be to phase out fossil fuel as soon as possible, and my colleagues already spoke about the 90 %, and that’s the line. But while we are studying the assessment, we have to take a glance at the reality. The reality is that agriculture does not have the same possibilities as industry. Agriculture does not have the same productivity development. Thereby we have a structural problem. We cannot place the same onus on agriculture as on industry.

Bas Eickhout,"Mr President, first of all, thank you to the Commission for this communication. Now to those who are now so surprised by it: first of all, we have international negotiations. Already in 2015, in the Paris Agreement, it was very clearly promised that every five years we needed a continuous debate for our targets later on. So, in 2015, when everyone was applauding Paris, you knew that between 2023 and 2025, we need to discuss 2035. Well, the Commission makes that 2040. This was everything part of the Paris Agreement, but maybe some people forgot about that. By the way, in the Climate Law, we said ‘within six months of the global stocktake, we will come up with this discussion,’ and the global stocktake was in Dubai. So we have to do this. People who are surprised now, maybe they should read why they voted for the climate law, because then you agreed with this time path. On the number, 90 %, there I have to say that that if you read the advisory board very clearly, they say you need to sit between 90-95 %. If you are serious, looking at our historical responsibility and the possibilities of our CO2 budget, basically even we should be climate neutral by 2040. That’s what science is telling us. So 90% is on the low end, but we know the difficulty. So we can welcome the 90% also because it was promised before in October. Then, how are we going to reach that 90 %? First of all, we need to give a very clear signal for the end of fossil in the electricity system. Somewhere there, some sentences have improved. But, on the other hand, you said, Mr Hoekstra, in Dubai, don’t CCS your way out of the problem. Well, ladies and gentlemen, there is a lot of CCS-ing out of the problem by Europe now. Even up to the amount of 400 million tons of CO2; even the CCS lobby is only counting on 300. So, you are overshooting the CCS lobby. That’s impressive. Maybe the last point: you deleted everything on agriculture. Please don’t make the Dutch mistake by not talking about the agriculture. It doesn’t solve the problems.

As you know, this is a key political file, important for our economy, the sustainability of our food system and the livelihoods of our farmers. With regard to the precautionary principle and are we ignoring it, I would say ‘no, absolutely not’. We fully recognise and uphold the importance of the precautionary principle. The safety of citizens always comes first. The rules we are proposing maintain a high level of protection of human, animal and environmental health. The proposal is based on the current scientific knowledge about the safety of NGT plants. This warrants a proportionate approach based on the different risk profiles that result from the diversity of NGTs. This is fully compatible with the precautionary principle. By adapting the regulatory burden to the level of risk, we also support innovation and facilitate the arrival on the European market of safe plants and plant products for farmers and consumers. Having said that, I do welcome the constructive spirit that has made it possible to make such rapid progress. Let it not be said that the EU did not listen to our farmers and scientists on the need for new tools to support food production and overcome very real challenges, because climate change impacts, such as extreme weather events and new plant pests, pose a direct threat to agriculture here in the EU and worldwide.

People want to know what’s in the food they buy and what they eat. GMO labelling is absolutely essential to guarantee consumers’ right to choose. This regulation is a deliberate attack on the rights and freedoms of producers and consumers to be informed and to choose.

We have huge opportunity here, not just for farmers, but right across the globe in terms of food security – and that is a significant challenge in many parts of the world. So, the world is round, it is not flat, and we should use the science to underpin it. With that in mind, this gives us huge opportunities in the areas of drought resistance, a reduction on inputs like fertilisers and pesticides. This is an opportunity to ensure that we can enhance biodiversity, and increase food security, and allow farmers to embrace technologies that are proven for centuries in terms of selective breeding.

Today is another step in the European Union’s journey towards climate neutrality. We already have our fixed targets of 55 % of emission cuts by 2030, as everyone is aware. And now, we are launching a dialogue – and let me stress that word, ‘a dialogue’ – on the pathway towards 2040. Before we get started, Madam Chair, it is important to recall what today’s step is and what it is not. What we are proposing, what the Commission is proposing, is a solid analysis of what a good pathway towards 2040 could look like. Today is in fact the start of that dialogue with citizens, with businesses, with trade unions, with Members of Parliament here, but also at a national and at a local level. And that is what the Commission is doing. The decision to come up with a legislative proposal will be for the next Commission. Based on the best available science and a detailed impact assessment – as I’m sure you have seen – we are recommending that the 2040 target should be a 90 % cut in emissions. So why are we making this recommendation now? Well, at the risk of repeating myself, because the case for climate action is beyond doubt and requires planning in the here and now. We’ve just lived through the hottest summer on record, and we’ve seen for ourselves the devastation that climate change brings and sadly, evermore in human lives. And as weather patterns become more unpredictable, become more extreme, this will also come with an increasing economic cost. Therefore, it is important to note that inaction would lead to far larger and growing costs in the coming decades. Ladies and gentlemen, there is another reason to put this forward in the here and now. We will keep on offering to our industry, businesses and financial institutions the thing they always ask for: clarity and predictability for their investments. But it is also absolutely essential – it is absolutely essential – that we need to do more to enable them and citizens to get to the destination. And going forward, it is therefore of tremendous importance that we stand firmly on two legs. One clearly is the leg of climate action and that we have to stay the course. And the other, the leg to which we need to bridge, to which we need to marry, is a strong and resilient economy with a bright future for all our businesses, large and small, and a transition that is truly just. We cannot have one without the other. I am absolutely convinced we do need to make sure that we have the two, because the vast majority of our citizens see the effects of climate change, do want to have us take action, but are also worried about what that implies for their livelihood. So let’s make sure we work on the two. Ladies and gentlemen, if we manage to pull this off, if we manage to do this, we will also increase our energy independence and strengthen our EU’s open strategic autonomy. And we know how important that is. Ladies and gentlemen, today’s communication lays some further foundations for future work to ramp up affordable, clean energy, to make our rules as easy as possible to navigate and to have a smart European approach to de-risk private investments in the key technologies of the future. And we need to have comprehensive investment and a comprehensive investment agenda to attract private capital. As a matter of fact, we not only need more public, but certainly also much more private capital for this endeavour. Therefore, we will propose a concrete roadmap to boost and finance technologies across Europe. Having said that, whatever we agree and whatever we discuss here on our own continent, in this Parliament, the scale of the challenge we are facing remains planetary. The EU’s emissions, at 7 % of the global total, are only one piece of the puzzle. But as global leaders in climate action, we cannot call on other countries to do more to accelerate their transitions and not continue ourselves. We’ll therefore also establish a dedicated Commission taskforce on carbon market diplomacy. We will offer our expertise to other countries that wish to create their own version of what I view as one of the most successful things we have done in the domain of climate action: an emissions trading system. And this is one example of where, with other partners, we can race to the top both from a climate action perspective and from the perspective of a global level playing field for sustainable businesses to flourish. Ladies and gentlemen, let me wrap up. Tackling the climate crisis is a marathon, not a sprint. And 2040 seems far away, but the sooner we start planning, the sooner we start working towards it, the better equipped we will be to continue and ultimately finish this journey. So we’re starting the political discussions in this esteemed Chamber, and we will continue to do so outside of this room with all stakeholders that are relevant to this endeavour, including, of course, the various businesses and all of our citizens. And we do that to make sure that we have a balanced approach and everyone at our continent can be seen and can meet the finish line. PRESIDÊNCIA: PEDRO SILVA PEREIRA Vice-Presidente",-,2024-02-06,10.

Maroš Šefčovič,"Mr President, Ms Minister, honourable Members, I am sure that we all vividly remember our extraordinary plenary session in Brussels, taking place a few days after the Russian invasion in Ukraine. I recall our common shock and horror that, after long decades of peace, war has returned back to Europe. As you recall, we listened to the video-link address of President Zelenskyy and have been impressed by his determination to fight the invaders, to defend the liberty and sovereignty of his country. I believe that that was the moment when this unbreakable bond between the European Union and Ukraine was firmly established. At that time, we couldn’t imagine the level of human suffering, the scale of tragic loss of lives, and destruction brought by war. At that time, we couldn’t imagine either the bravery of the Ukrainian people, but also the level and strength of European solidarity, unity and resilience. We couldn’t expect the rapid enlargement of NATO and the vigour of the enlargement process, where Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and Western Balkan countries are now firmly on the path to become EU Member States. The decision of the European Council on the EUR 50 billion of Ukraine Facility, which we discussed at the previous debate, confirms that the EU will stay shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine and Ukrainians, and that we will do that as long as it takes. This debate, honourable Members, sends another strong message of support and solidarity to Ukraine. For that, I really would like to thank you.",-,2024-02-06,"3.

European leaders parading around chanting about glory, draped in flags, pretending to care about democracy and international law while slobbering over arms contracts. It’s easy to see why you’d want the war to go on, but it’s over. While you’re amusing yourselves with your pantomime Churchill acts, Ukraine is running out of men and running out of hope.

Riho Terras,"Mr President, colleagues, not a day goes by without Russia causing death and pain all across Ukraine. After two years of full-scale war on European soil, Europe has moved very slowly from an ignorant state of mind to a state of alert. I believe it has been a very costly lesson. The Council decision regarding the EUR 50 billion aid package last week was a much- appreciated lifeline for Ukraine, but we need more. It’s merely one sixth of what Ukraine needs in the coming four years. This particular war cannot be won by sending obsolete military equipment to Ukraine, but military technological supremacy – and that costs money. Therefore, Estonia calls for an initiative of 0.25 % of GDP to be allocated for Ukraine, which equals EUR 120 billion military aid annually. Together, we can out-power the aggressor. I have no doubt about it. This is for our own security and for our own way of life. Slava Ukraini! Catch-the-eye procedure",PPE,2024-02-06,"3.

Putin will not stop either, unless we give Ukraine the military support it needs to win – not just what it needs not to lose.

Austria was blocking 12 packages of sanctions because one of their banks was on the list of the war sponsors. What about the rest?

Today, our task must be crystal—clear – Ukraine’s resilience is non-negotiable. Our peace is no longer a natural given right. For both of these reasons, we must equip our Union with what it takes to become a credible, long—term security provider.

Though the situation at the battlefield is a stalemate, the EU has proven that it will be forged in crisis, as Jean Monnet said. Just see the collective defence efforts, energy imports, and sanctions. But we need to do more. The Council’s decision last week is a strong message from the EU in all directions – to Ukraine, which is fighting for freedom, to Russia, which counted on the fatigue of the EU with the war and perhaps on its general collapse, but also to Washington – that the EU does not give up its efforts for Kyiv and that the US must also overcome internal divisions and continue supporting Ukraine. With this decision, EU engagement gains new momentum. In this super-election year, the EU should confirm at the global level that it still has a relevant significance.

Eva Maydell,"Our solidarity with for Ukraine must remain unwavering to counter an autocratic threat to democracies worldwide and to our security. When a democratic country fights a war of aggression with an authoritarian state, free nations cannot stand by. Only by delivering continued and substantial support – humanitarian, economic and military aid and ammunition – can we promote an alliance of democracies globally. If we grant autocracies impunity, they will use it to single out and overpower democracies one by one. Furthermore, the EU’s security and defence policy starts outside our borders. EU Member States can only be safe if we support and rebuild Ukraine first. Showing weakness to Russia, a country that has already been threatening Europe’s critical infrastructure and airspace, will only embolden them. Therefore, to defend democracies and promote European security, we must continue and increase our support for Ukraine. To be able to provide sufficient assistance to our Ukrainian partners necessitates a close diplomatic relationship with the US – the kind of cooperation that will stand the test of elections.

Andrius Kubilius,"Mr President, Ukrainians for two years and with a lot of sacrifice have been defending not only their country, but also all of us, including Mr Wallace. The victory of Ukraine depends on our political will to deliver what is needed for victory. Ukrainians are not failing with their bravery and sacrifice. We are failing with our assistance. Our assistance during those two years allowed Ukraine not to lose a war, but it was too short for the victory. Let’s remember that last year, Russia managed to spend more than EUR 100 billion on its war, while the Ukrainian side – with all our assistance – had only EUR 80 billion. All EU military assistance in the last year reached less than 0.1 % of EU GDP. We do not look serious with such numbers. The problem is that all our assistance depends on individual voluntary decision of each Member State on how much support to provide. Such an arrangement does not produce enough support. We have an example of our collective approach through the European Union plan for munitions deliveries. Despite its shortcomings, it is a good example of how the EU needs to act. We need to have an EU plan for the victory of Ukraine, which would cover all the military needs of Ukraine, not only artillery shells. Such a plan should start from the obligation of each Member State to deliver military assistance of not less than 0.25% of national GDP. As Sven Mikser said before, it would allow military production to be significantly increased both in Ukraine and in Europe. That is how Ukraine would start to prevail.

Ciarán Cuffe,"Madam President, Commissioner McGuinness. Ireland and Europe are in the middle of a solar revolution. In our own country, tens of thousands of homes had solar panels installed last year. In total, we’re going to get a gigawatt of new solar this year. Commissioner McGuinness, you and I studied the Ardnacrusha scheme back in school. We’re installing three times the power of that hydropower station every year. It’s an extraordinary achievement. Solar and wind will soon be the main source of electricity in the European Union, and with the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, we will be mandating that every new building is ready for solar. However, we are reliant on China for a lot of our solar needs. 40% of the world’s PV comes from Xinjiang, where the Uyghur people are systemically persecuted. We need to ensure that we’re not dependent on China and we need to make a choice: will this solar revolution be red or fully green? That is the choice we need to make. The Net Zero Industry Act will help us in that, but we need to make sure that the money is available. Commissioner, you know all about the European taxonomy.

It establishes a robust foundation for the use and sharing of interoperability solutions, including those based on open source.

However, the general theme that public sector systems should be interoperable is an important one and something that the EU has been championing for a while. Against that backdrop, it’s really strange that the Irish Government has recently concluded a contract for EUR 86 million for electronic health records management for our new children’s hospital with Epic Systems, whose software has been described infamously as not playing nicely with others. Other European countries that have implemented this record software have found it to be disastrous. In Finland and Denmark, 62% of doctors said they were not satisfied. In Norway, 90% of doctors said after using this system that it was a threat to patient health, and just dealing with this system cost one hospital EUR 10 million, monies that then couldn’t be used for a mental health centre.

The aim of this Act, it says, is to help public administrations and the private sector work together and establish an ecosystem of interoperability solutions for the EU’s public sector. Now, I agree that the public sector, particularly hospitals, should be able to share patient information on a cross-border basis if this can help the needs of the patient. But I’m not convinced of the private sector’s involvement in the proposal. And the idea of the public sector and private sector working together for the benefit of citizens – a bit of a farce.

Seán Kelly,"Madam President, solar energy is becoming increasingly important in Europe’s energy transition, with the scale of deployment surprising many experts. There were 20GW of new EU solar installations in 2020, doubling to 40 in 2022. Last year, as Commissioner Mairead McGuinness pointed out, Europe installed 56GW of solar capacity. Very impressive. This success is extremely welcome, but we cannot expect industry to maintain this positive trend if we expose European producers to unfair trading practices. Currently, we’re negotiating legislation to boost domestic production of key technologies, such as solar panels, wind turbines and heat pumps, aiming to reduce dependence on China, which currently accounts for almost 80% of global solar manufacturing. However, we must ask: will this happen quickly enough? Can we meet the target of having 40% of European demand for solar panels produced within Europe by 2030 if producers are already struggling? If we are to avoid economic vulnerabilities, we need to stand on our own two feet. Solar is an extremely important industry for the future, and Europe must be a significant part of it.

Mairead McGuinness,"Mr President, colleagues, the Interoperable Europe Act will make digital public services across the Union more efficient and more effective. Our goal is clear – the seamless interaction of digital public services across borders for citizens, businesses and public administrations. So the significance of this act cannot be understated. It lays the groundwork for a future where digital services are not hindered by geographic or bureaucratic boundaries, and this will make a real difference to European citizens. The Commission will make sure that this initiative is implemented cohesively across every level of government at the European, national, regional and local level. The agreement reached by the Parliament and Council respects a spirit of cooperation. Notably, there will be structured EU cooperation, with public administrations coming together in the framework of projects co-owned by Member States, regions and municipalities. There is a multi-level governance framework steered by the Interoperable Europe Board. Interoperability assessments will be mandatory to ensure better interconnection and synergies among public services. Interoperability solutions can be shared and reused, powered by a one-stop shop for solutions and community cooperation, the Interoperable Europe Portal, and supported by measures to promote innovation, improve skills and knowledge exchange. I would like to thank the rapporteur and his team for his efforts and constructive approach. You have shown your expertise and your commitment to finding pragmatic, common solutions, working in a very ambitious time frame.

The Commission will remain an active partner in this journey, ready to provide support and ensure that this act moves from paper into practice. We look forward to continuing our cooperation with the European Parliament on this file. We will provide annual reports to both Council and Parliament on the state of interoperability in the European Union. That means the Interoperable Europe Act will undoubtedly remain at the centre of our discussions. In summary, this act is a vital step towards a more integrated and innovative European digital landscape. It will help shape a responsive and forward—looking public sector.

Mairead McGuinness,"Mr President, colleagues, thank you all for your very strong contributions to this debate. There is concern, well expressed in this House, about the state of the EU solar industry, as you say in the title, ‘in light of unfair competition’. I did say in the opening remarks that we do have instruments to tackle unfair trade practices – so, just to put that again clearly to you – whenever this is, of course, in the European Union’s overall interest. Just to say that the EU has a plan to nurture net-zero manufacturing technologies that will limit our overdependence on imports, and create jobs and growth in Europe. Building on the existing practice of some EU Member States, the NZIA will result in the more regular use of resilience and sustainability criteria in EU auctions and procurement.

Mick Wallace,"Mr President, 96% of all solar panels installed in Europe in 2022 came from China. It would be absurd to criticise China for building up a solar industry. China’s solar manufacturing accounts for 78% of the world’s total PV module production. We’d be lost without China’s solar panel manufacturing. China’s industrial policy is helping massively to decarbonise the world. Tariffs on China would absolutely be the wrong approach. Solar Panel Europe, which is one of the largest solar industry representative associations, has been very clear that it does not support trade measures against China. Instead, it wants a relaxation of state aid rules for the industry. It wants resilience auctions and credit guarantees. China has invested over $50 billion in new PV supply capacity – 10 times more than Europe. In a crisis – and the climate crisis is the biggest crisis we’ve ever had to face – we need a strong state and we need strong state supports. If we want good quality, green jobs in Europe, we should follow China’s example instead of giving out about them. (End of catch-the-eye procedure)",The Left,2024-02-05,15.

Clare Daly,"Mr President, solar panels just keep getting cheaper and cheaper, solar prices have dropped by 85 %, that’s something we should be delighted about. At those prices, we can actually undergo a rapid transition of our energy system and meet our climate goals with ease. But instead of that, we’re in here complaining about it. We say that other countries subsidising their solar panel manufacturing is unfair competition; it’s unjustified state aid. Well, it’s a bit ironic that you’re constantly in here saying about how the EU is a great leader in all of these things, and other countries are doing nothing. How is subsidising solar panels and renewable energy unjustified? Are we just in the business of trying to make money for shareholders, or do we want to change the global energy system? It is true, of course, that we need an EU solar manufacturing capability, like we do all strategic sectors, but this crisis is what happens when you liberalise the energy sector and leave it all up to the market.

Adina-Ioana Vălean,"Mr President, honourable Members, let me start by thanking Mr Vitanov and the Committee on Transport and Tourism (TRAN) for the excellent report on the proposal for a directive on the Union-wide effect of certain driving disqualifications. As you know, this proposal is an integral part of the Road Safety Package, which the Commission adopted in March 2023, and it has close links to the Driving Licence Directive and the Directive on cross-border exchange of information on road-safety-related traffic offences. The legislative framework created by these three pieces of legislation should be seen as vital to getting closer to reaching our goal of zero fatalities or serious injuries on European roads by 2050. It will guarantee the high standards of skills and fitness of our drivers. It will also enable us to react in case certain individuals break the rules, putting themselves and other road users at risk. On that note, please allow me to ask a question: what is the main purpose of this proposal that we are discussing today? Of course, it is about driving disqualifications, but it is first and foremost about safety and fairness. When it comes to safety, the efficient enforcement of driving disqualifications has clearly shown that it is a strong deterrent against major road safety—related traffic offences. Studies suggest that efficient enforcement not only increases the compliance of drivers who get sanctioned, but also shows to the wider driver population the risks they are taking should they decide to breach the law. Secondly, let’s talk about fairness. Currently, for the same offence, a driver can be disqualified in the territory of the whole Union or simply in the territory of the Member State where the offence took place. This depends in which Member States his or her driving licence was issued. In the latter case, such a driver will be able to go to other Member States and continue driving as if nothing has happened. This situation is clearly unfair. Why should we keep allowing dangerous drivers on our roads? Putting an end to such unjustified differentiation of treatment would be the other core objective of our proposal. There are also other important elements of fairness in the text – the grounds for refusal. We should ensure that our proposal remains reasonable, focusing on the most severe offences, and takes into consideration the differences we have between road traffic rules in the Member States. At the same time, the proposal also establishes clear conditions under which Member States can refuse a request to disqualify a driver. For example, if the offence committed would not be sanctioned with a driver disqualification in the Member State which issued the driving licence, or in the event that there are doubts or evidence of a breach of fundamental rights of the driver. Our proposal also contains safeguards for ensuring drivers’ rights, in particular when it comes to access to information, defence and data protection. In conclusion, safety and fairness are the two elements that this proposal is all about. Ensuring safety by showcasing that everyone should respect the rules on the European roads and that no one enjoys impunity, should they breach those rules are very important as well. We also want to guarantee that offenders are treated on an equal footing. I look forward to an interesting debate, and I count on the adoption of your report tomorrow, as it will be as an important step to improve safety on the roads.",-,2024-02-05,17.

By an overwhelming majority, the judges of the International Court of Justice found that South Africa’s claim that Israel had breached certain articles of the Genocide Convention to be ‘plausible’. So what did European governments do on the finding of plausible genocide acts? Nothing. The following day, and hardly coincidentally, an intelligence assessment found that 12 UNWRA staff out of 13 000 were possibly involved in the horrors of 7 October. A US assessment found this to be ‘credible’. What did EU governments do on the finding of credible intelligence assessment? They cut off humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza at a time of maximum vulnerability.

Barry Andrews,"Mr President, Commissioner and colleagues, despite it only being five weeks into 2024, 18 people have already lost their lives on Irish roads this year. 2023 had the highest fatality rate in nearly a decade in Ireland, made worse by a substantial increase in the number of deaths of young people. The Road Safety Authority in Ireland has noted that this isn’t just an Irish phenomenon. All over Europe, there has been an increase in fatal crashes since the end of COVID. A recent study by Eurostat found that road fatalities in the EU have increased by 6% after a decade of continuous decline. A new EU directive to extend driving disqualifications is very welcome. To ensure road safety and effective enforcement of road safety regulations, it is crucial that the EU takes a consistent approach to recognising and enforcing driver disqualifications across the Member States. Public awareness campaigns to inform EU citizens of mutual recognition of disqualifications is absolutely essential. Mounting fatalities on both Irish and EU roads have increased the urgency of these measures.",Renew,2024-02-05,17.

Mick Wallace,"Mr President, this cross-border directive is an attempt to force Member States to exchange information in relation to certain driving disqualifications. As you know, if a driver is convicted of an offence in one country, the sanctions only apply to that country at the moment. I’m a bit sceptical of cross-border directives and whether they are required at all. Take, for example, the EU Commission’s flagship cross-border directive on health. Ten years since its implementation, and the Commission itself accepts that the directive has been a failure. If a person has been convicted, for example, of excessive speed – and whatever that means – should they be punished in 27 Member States? It seems a bit mad to me. I think that’s a bit over the top. I’m just wondering, is this part of building a United States of Europe, or is just an effort to increase bureaucracy? It doesn’t make an awful lot of sense to me.",The Left,2024-02-05,17.

Clare Daly,"Mr President, I think this is an important file, but it should be handled carefully. We don’t want data bogged down for minor misdemeanours. We have a history of problems in Ireland with the way in which our police force have managed traffic offences, with a lot of political or Garda interference in that. I think this should be about enforcing driving disqualification across the EU for offences where the seriousness of the behaviour results in major harm or death. Thanks to the heroic work of one Irish mother, Lucia O’Farrell, and the O’Farrell family, this issue is very well known in Ireland. In 2011, Shane O’Farrell had just finished his law exams. He was 23 years old and he was knocked down as he cycled home. He was left to die on the side of the road by a driver who failed to stop: a driver who had been at that time out on bail for multiple charges of criminality and traffic offences. A Lithuanian who was convicted of dangerous driving causing death but acquitted on the basis that he leaves the country.

Adina-Ioana Vălean,"Mr President, thank you very much, dear Members, for a lively discussion and also for a broad support for the idea and for this proposal. I’m really happy to see that apart from the divergent views on some specific issues, the Parliament, I’m interpreting, is ready to support our proposal. A few words on some of the issues which were raised. Again, we are talking here about a package. We would have loved to see the whole package adopted at the same time. All the package elements will work together to ensure road safety. On the other hand, each proposal is a different tool, which, together with the others, will create a basket of tools to address road safety. So, from this perspective, driving licences focus on skills and training, and the cross-border enforcement focuses on better enforcement of road safety offences. Driving disqualifications focus on the most severe offences which should result in driving disqualification in the Union. We paid a lot of attention to subsidiarity. On the other hand, of course, it is not possible to have a Union-wide effect without a Union intervention. But I would say balance is in the text, preserving Member States’ competence and especially thanks to the grounds for refusal. It was a discussion about the penalty points under the scope of the directive; I’ve noticed the willingness in the recitals of the adopted report to assess the feasibility of eventually including the so-called demerit points under the scope of the directive. While I see the good intention behind this request, let me recall you that such point systems are, by their very nature, designed as long-term solutions to sanction perpetrators of repeated minor offences, with different seriousness assigned to them. As opposed to this, the proposal primarily concerns people who are committing the most serious offences in transit that should lead to their immediate disqualification. Again, these are a couple of remarks. It is indeed a file which will bring concrete understanding and positive effects, I would say, for all citizens and all those who are sharing the roads, let’s hope in a safer way. Thank you very much for the debate and I really hope that you will vote on this, even though I’m sorry it’s not going to be adopted in this legislature because the Council is delayed.

Adina-Ioana Vălean,"Mr President, honourable Members, almost three years after the assassination of President Moïse, the multilayered crisis in Haiti rages on. We read with concern the latest report by the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti about rampant insecurity, the strength of armed gangs and the limited capacity of state institutions to restore security and rule of law. The capacity of gangs to gather large quantities of arms and ammunition is of particular concern, and violent incidents – including killings, kidnappings, sexual violence – persist with alarming impunity. There is an urgent need to take action to stop the illegal proliferation of firearms and ammunition in the country. This is an area where the European Union is willing to continue offering its support to Haiti, and other Caribbean countries facing similar challenges. Innocent citizens continue to pay the highest price. A chronic security, economic and political crisis, exacerbated by natural catastrophes, has led to the current humanitarian crisis in Haiti. Today, more than 40 % of the Haitian population suffers from acute food insecurity. Recurrent cholera outbreaks continue to claim numerous victims. The Haitian state cannot be left alone in its fight against the gangs and the multifold crisis the country needs to address. Haiti’s international partners, including the United Nations, have a crucial role to play. The resolution of the United Nations Security Council, passed on 2 October last year, authorising a multinational security mission in support of Haiti to be led by Kenya, was an important and long-overdue breakthrough. The same resolution indicates the need to create effective accountability mechanisms to protect human rights, and to avoid the mistakes made during the previous UN-led mission, MINUSTAH, which ended in 2017. The EU has taken note of the recent ruling of Kenya’s High Court on the proposed deployment of Kenyan police to lead the mission. We are awaiting with interest the response of the Kenyan Government to enable the mission to proceed. The European Union will continue to provide support for Haiti’s stability, development and better integration in the Caribbean region. Our cooperation and humanitarian envelope for Haiti is by far the largest in the Americas. Despite the many difficulties in implementing our programmes, the European Union remains committed to play its part alongside our international partners, and will continue supporting the broader objectives of a multinational support mission once it is deployed – restoring stability, supporting governance, both indirectly through our cooperation instruments, and directly through our support for the Haitian National Police. Alongside the security track, it is important to continue pursuing a political solution to take the country out of the current crisis. We welcome the active involvement of regional organisations, particularly the CARICOM and the Organization of American States, supporting a Haitian-led political solution built on the basis of a constructive dialogue between the Government and the Opposition. Unfortunately, we regret to see how the Haitian parties have failed to come together around a credible solution to the current institutional impasse. Haitians deserve better than this. We urge, therefore, the main political stakeholders to engage in a genuine dialogue and renew their efforts to find an effective compromise, with the ultimate goal to prepare the country for credible and inclusive elections once security conditions will allow.",-,2024-02-05,18.

Mick Wallace,"Mr President, another US-backed and funded occupation of Haiti. That it will be lent a black face by Kenya is one of the worst ideas I’ve heard for a while: the Kenyan police are notoriously violent and have a history of working in collusion with gangs, not disrupting them at home in Kenya. Haiti has been occupied multiple times and every time the situation seems to get worse. The crisis today is a direct result of the Brazil-led UN occupation from 2004 to 2017. Haiti doesn’t need foreign forces, it needs the IMF to stop choking them to death. They do not need structural adjustment programs: they need health and aid workers, debt relief and the ability to grow their own food. In the 70s, Haiti was self-sufficient in rice production, now it buys 82 % of its rice from the US. When will the US stop suffocating Haiti, carrying out coups, backing dictatorships and crushing their economy?

Haiti is – God help them – an assisted state supported in nation building by the US, pretty much like they helped Iraq and Afghanistan. Is it any wonder it’s such a mess? All Haitian elections since 2004 have been monitored, constant foreign interference, effective military occupation, Western NGOs taking over basic public services. What’s left to vote for in a country no longer their own? Clearly, Western powers want to control Haiti’s destiny. They’re doing everything they can to colonise them again. Well, they should look back at Haiti’s history. This is an island of slaves who rose up and drove out their colonisers. You will not prevail.

Adina-Ioana Vălean,"Mr President, Members, thank you for the debate. The atmosphere is sombre, I would say, because of what is going on and also a bit of a negative feeling I can detect in all the speakers. At the last summit we had, EU-CELAC, the UN, partner countries in Latin America and the Caribbean agreed on the need to support Haiti in tackling the dire humanitarian crisis and in paving the way towards security and stabilisation. For countries like Haiti, the proliferation of illicit small arms and light weapons is at the origin of the strength of the gangs and is detrimental to the achievement of sustainable peace, security and socio-economic development, including in the rest of the region. Therefore, the summit declaration included specific provisions on the fight against illicit arms trafficking, which is instrumental to curb domestic and transnational organised crime, drug trafficking, trafficking in persons, money laundering, the illegal exploitation of natural resources, and domestic violence. In the same declaration, we also stressed the need to consolidate and strengthen the EU-CELAC cooperation initiatives in the field of citizen security and social justice, such as EU-LAC Partnership on Justice and Security. On these themes, the EU is ready to do its part. Regarding the participation directly to the multinational security intervention (MSSM) in Haiti, I should remind you that the EU’s support could consist in actions that support the mission and indirectly, notably with complementary actions that could provide an enabling environment for the work of the mission or help the sustainability of its results. Prospects for a direct EU contribution in terms of equipment and personnel would depend directly on the readiness of the EU Member States to contribute, and in any case, we should stress that the EU is already providing significant and indirect support to the Kenyan Defence Forces through the European Peace Facility to increase their capability in order to participate in peacekeeping operations, and we hope this is the case now.

It was welcomed by patients and by practitioners alike at the time, prioritising safety, health and innovation. However, after more than six years of implementation, the objectives of this legislation have not been fully realised. Short-term challenges – and I acknowledge there has been some attempt to address this – but there has been a serious lack of availability of some products and the current framework lacks predictability and it lacks efficiency. It fails to keep pace with the required innovation to develop new medical technologies, resulting in increased costs that have a disproportionate effect on SMEs. The converse are alarming for European patients: they are at risk of losing access to the latest technologies, with Europe no longer the choice to launch products, so clinicians are already facing delays and lack of availability of devices. This is having a disproportionate effect on smaller patient populations, rare diseases and paediatric patients, and the difficulties in establishing this framework need to be addressed as a matter of urgency.",PPE,2024-02-05,19.

In 2019, Ursula von der Leyen said in this Chamber that carbon emissions must have a price that will change our behaviour. All the EU’s so-called green laws, promoted by the Commission in the past years, want to change the behaviour of Europeans through measures that we saw implemented in Eastern Europe by communists when they wanted to take people’s land and mass surveil them. The utopian communist collectivism could not have been implemented unless people willingly or forcibly gave up their private land to the state. Those who refused to do it had to pay taxes and quotas from their productions that were bigger than what they could harvest. The new carbon laws implemented by the European Commission under Ursula von der Leyen is no different from what the communists did in Eastern Europe to take the land away from the people.

This topic, which needs to be a serious issue, needs to be addressed and is being dealt with with the utmost importance in other countries. For example, in the United States, the data collection and analysis of UAP activities in space, civil and military locations is considered as a national security priority. This security concern also led to the creation of a space research programme inside NASA.

Michiel Hoogeveen,"Madam President, I thank you, Commissioner McGuinness and all the colleagues who have contributed to this very important debate. As I’ve already highlighted, the best feature of the Instant Payments Regulation for citizens is that it takes the EU closer to frictionless payments. This Regulation is important for Europe’s strategy to encourage European innovation, and we do this by making credit transfers cheaper for citizens and merchants. This Regulation features rolling deadlines for Eurozone and non-Eurozone payment service providers to be able to receive and send instant payments. The first of these deadlines, that of payment service providers being able to receive instant payments in the Eurozone, will come into force already nine months from the entry of force of this Regulation, so we can expect instant payments will be a feature of the Eurozone before the end of 2024. Non-Eurozone Member States, understandably, need some extra time, and as someone who believes that the EU should be a flexible organisation, I was glad to support this as a rapporteur.

Mairead McGuinness,"Madam President, colleagues, I want to thank the Parliament for the opportunity to take the floor on this very crucial issue, the situation of the EU solar industry. I do want to start with some good news: the EU installed 56 GW of solar photovoltaic (PV) last year, according to industry data. This is a record and is twice as much as just two years earlier. Solar energy is one of the key pillars of the energy transition; it is the fastest growing source of electricity, responsible for 8 % of the electricity generated last year in the European Union. Solar installations are an equally important contributor to our energy autonomy: the installations of the last two years allow us to save 15 billion cubic metres of Russian gas imports, and these are impressive figures. Yet, in order to reach our ambitious 2030 target for renewables, we still need to see further acceleration in both solar and wind deployment. In six years, by 2030, we expect the solar panels deployment to increase by 20 %. Two thirds of these solar installations last year were on our rooftops. Citizens and companies have taken advantage of this cheap source of energy to weather the high energy prices of the past two years. This boom is also a source of economic growth and job creation: in 2022, the sector was responsible for 650 000 jobs, and this number is increasing rapidly towards 1 million. Eight out of ten jobs in this sector are related to solar panel deployment, one out of ten to solar panel manufacturing. The EU needs to have access to affordable solar panels to fuel the green transition and unlock the economic opportunities, and the green transition is also an economic opportunity for the EU. This rapid deployment builds on the solar energy strategy adopted in May 2022 as part of the REPower EU package. The strategy included a set of actions to promote solar energy, including the development of the solar manufacturing industry. The supply of the EU market is highly dependent on imports, as more than 97 % of the solar panels deployed in Europe are imported, mainly from China. However, if we take a closer look at the solar supply chain, the EU has some strong assets on which it could develop this ecosystem. The EU has one of the strongest, or rather is one of the strongest producers of polysilicon worldwide, but also has globally competitive manufacturers of inverters and trackers. With the exception of the period of COVID-related related supply chain turbulence, the increasingly rapid deployment of solar energy across the EU has been driven over the years by the decreasing costs and prices. Colleagues, since 2023, a global oversupply and a surge of imports in the EU has put under strong pressure the solar supply chains. Solar panel prices have plummeted by over 40 %. These falling prices are an opportunity for citizens and solar panel installers as it supports internal demand, and it is clearly a challenge to EU solar panel producers. Our European solar panel manufacturers have their modules in stock suffering from losses and are forced to scale back or freeze production lines. As spelled out by the International Energy Agency in its outlook, the uncertainties on the evolution of prices are high: on the one hand, global solar panel deployment is expected to further accelerate. On the other hand, the deployment of massive expansion of production is also in the making, mainly in China, and this situation might remain. The EU is therefore actively working on a vast set of instruments to support the solar industry. In order to support the acceleration of the green transition, the EU adopted the Green Deal industrial plan: it creates a supportive environment to scale up the EU’s net-zero industry, including solar. As part of this plan, the Commission presented a proposal for a net-zero industry act, which is at the final stretches of the negotiations between Parliament and the Council. We hope that both institutions will find an ambitious agreement on this important piece of legislation in the trilogue tomorrow. The net-zero industry act (NZIA) includes several measures relevant for the solar panel sector. In particular, it aims at the leveraging of public demand through renewable energy auctions and public procurement, using resilience and sustainability criteria to favour the diversification of the sourcing of net-zero technologies. The NZIA package will include guidelines and recommendations to help EU Member States to make full use of the flexibilities under the existing legislative framework, which already allows the inclusion of non-price criteria in competitive auctions and procurements. Some EU Member States are already using these flexibilities. By applying more systemically objective, transparent and non-discriminatory non-price criteria, the resilience and sustainability contributions of the different offers will be better taken into consideration by EU Member States, and that will contribute to diversifying their source of supply. Additionally, to organise and support the EU solar industry in scaling up, the Commission also launched the European Solar PV Industry Alliance, which set itself the target of 30 GW of production capacity along the value chain by 2025. This is a pipeline of projects waiting for a financing decision. The European Investment Bank has recently adopted a financial package to boost the production capacity of high-performance bifacial PV modules, and this is to be done by one of the EU key manufacturers in Italy. Europe’s biggest solar factory, 3SUN, secured EUR 560 million’s worth of financing from the EIB and a pool of Italian banks led by UniCredit and backed by the Italian export credit agency. On the financing side, the current state aid framework – the temporary crisis and transition framework – allows Member States to provide support to new investments in clean tech industries, including solar panels. EU Member States can use this flexibility. In less than a year, since March 2023, the Commission has approved 9 schemes with a budget of over EUR 12 billion for strategic equipment necessary for the net-zero transition, including solar panels. Furthermore, several aid measures for solar panel manufacturers have been approved under the regional aid guidelines. Member States have until the end of 2025 to approve their plans and, as I said, several of them have already done so. As regards EU funds, the Innovation Fund has so far granted support to new investment in solar manufacturing projects to the tune of EUR 400 million over two years. The ongoing call for proposals has a strong focus on manufacturing. The objective of the new Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform is precisely to support sectors like solar panel manufacturing. In addition, we need to ensure that solar panels installed in the EU are produced in a sustainable manner. This is why the Commission is working on developing eco-design and energy labelling requirements. Other horizontal legislation might also be relevant for this sector, such as the regulation to ban products made using forced labour. The EU is also working with reliable third countries on reinforcing our supply chains. We share a common interest in de-risking our joint over-dependency by promoting the diversification of our sourcing. For instance, the EU is cooperating actively with the US and India in order to boost the development of the PV sector. Finally, when justified, the EU also has instruments to tackle unfair trade practices such as dumping of injurious subsidisation – when that is in the overall Union interest, we can take that action. Given that we currently rely to a very important degree on imports to reach EU solar deployment targets, any potential measure needs to be weighed against the objectives we have set ourselves when it comes to the energy transition.

No, it’s from an article in the Financial Times about the EU plans to undermine the Hungarian economy for political purposes. ‘The EU will sabotage Hungary’s economy if Budapest blocks fresh aid to Ukraine. In a document drawn up by EU officials and seen by the Financial Times, Brussels has outlined a strategy to explicitly target Hungary’s economic weaknesses, imperil its currency and drive a collapse in investor confidence in a bid to hurt jobs and growth if Budapest refuses to lift its veto against the aid to Kyiv. This is Europe telling Viktor Orbán, ‘you may have a pistol, but we have the bazooka.’’ I demand an explanation of the President of the Council, Mr Michel.

Mairead McGuinness,"Madam President, thank you very much, colleagues, for all of the contributions. And I think we now need to move to the next stage, which is implementation of the regulation. What I want to see are that these new rules are implemented not just quickly, but smoothly. The payment sector is fully aware of what needs to be done and it has already started doing it. The deadlines are short but without deadlines there could be even further delays on instant payments, and this would deny consumers and businesses the chance of reaping the benefits of these instant payments. The payment sector can count on the support of the Commission, and we will make clarifications if questions arise during implementation. The work of supporting instant payments does not stop with this regulation. This is at EU level but there is also the wider international picture to consider, especially the G20’s ambition around instant payments internationally. And we are committed as a Commission to that international work on instant payments. And just as I finish, the honourable Member Mr Wallace will be glad to know that we do have on your desk at the moment a proposal referring to access and acceptability of cash. I certainly wasn’t the one who invented the phrase ‘cash is king’, but I’ve used it frequently because consumers want choice. They want the choice between digital and cash.

Mick Wallace,"Madam President, (start of speech off mic) ... the speed, ease and availability of instant payments on apps like Revolut and Monzo have been welcome, but the legislative proposal does not include any considerations regarding the prospective energy consumption and possibilities to ensure energy efficiency if the use of instant payments is increased. While instant payments can enhance financial inclusion, ensuring that vulnerable populations have access to these systems without compromising their security or privacy remains a concern. I am also worried that increasing the uptake of IPs will also most likely reduce the will to maintain the ever—decreasing funding of infrastructure for cash payments. Cash is still the most inclusive means of payment. There are no hidden charges when paying with cash and it provides the highest degree of independence and protection available from the private banking sector. Cash is still king, and I hope it stays that way. (Ende der spontanen Wortmeldungen)",The Left,2024-02-05,14.

Mairead McGuinness,"Madam President, honourable Members, I want to thank the House for putting on the agenda of this plenary the situation of prisoners in Hungarian jails, including the case of Ilaria Salis. As you know, detention issues are mainly a competence and responsibility of the Member States, but the Charter of Fundamental Rights does require that, within the scope of EU law, detention conditions do not violate fundamental rights. In addition, all EU Member States have committed to respect standards on this matter from the Council of Europe, such as the 2006 European Prison Rules, at EU level in December 2022. The Commission adopted a Recommendation on the procedural rights of suspects and accused persons subject to pre-trial detention and on material detention conditions. While the minimum standards laid down in the recommendation are not legally binding on Member States, they serve as a reference point to improve the situation in prisons within the EU. The issue of detention is one of the priorities of the Belgian Presidency of the Council. The topic of small—scale detention was discussed at the informal Justice Council on 26 January. I would like to draw your attention to EU legislation which is relevant here. The Council Framework Decision 2009/829/JHA of 2009 on the European supervision order allows suspected persons to be supervised in their home country while awaiting trial in another Member State. It has been transposed by Hungary and Italy. The Framework Decision aims to prevent inequalities between residents and non-residents in the trial state. This is because non-residents are remanded in custody more often than residents in similar circumstances. The Commission is aware that bilateral contacts have taken place between Italy and Hungary. They have discussed the possibility of alternatives to detention in the case of Ms Salis, including the possibility of house arrest, while she awaits trial. This situation would be in line with the Council conclusions on alternative measures to detention, adopted during the Finnish Presidency in 2019. These conclusions point out that non-custodial sanctions and measures should be considered where they are appropriate to the circumstances of a case. I would like to underline that the Commission is available to help find a viable solution within the EU framework. The Commission attaches great importance to the respect for procedural rights for suspects and accused persons in criminal proceedings. The EU has adopted six procedural rights directives to establish EU—wide minimum standards for a high level of fair trial rights. These rights include the right to interpretation and translation, the right to information and access to the materials of the case and, in particular, all materials essential to effectively challenge the lawfulness of an arrest or detention. They also include the presumption of innocence, from which derives the prohibition on presenting suspects and accused persons as being guilty in court or in public through the use of measures of physical restraint. The Commission’s priority is to make sure that all these rights are correctly and effectively implemented in practice by the Member States. Where necessary, the Commission will not hesitate to launch infringement proceedings if there are violations of EU law. More generally, the Commission will continue to monitor the efficiency, quality and independence of the national justice systems of Member States through its annual Rule of Law Reports and the EU Justice Scoreboard.",-,2024-02-05,"13.

Michiel Hoogeveen,"Madam President, dear Commissioner, dear colleagues, let me first thank the Commission for its excellent initiative. That was the basis for the work done by the Parliament and the Council. With the agreement on instant payments, we deliver on an opportunity to do something that people and businesses truly care about. They will be able to transfer money within 10 seconds at any time of the day, including outside business hours, not only within the same country, but also to another EU Member State. This is not about some abstract plumbing of the financial system, or super-technical capital requirements for banks or insurance companies, or fine-tuning of the European statistical system; instead, this is something very concrete, and something that Europeans truly care about in their daily lives. Ask yourself: have you ever wondered why a package from an online retailer reaches you faster than a payment from a friend from another EU Member State? Why can we send emails all over the world in a split second, but a payment from Belgium to Latvia still takes two to three business days? Madam President, our payments transaction system is based on a system from the 1980s. With the Instant Payments Regulation, we finally enter the 21st century. I would like to highlight four important aspects. First, convenience: 10 seconds for each transaction. Some EU countries, such as the Netherlands or Spain, already have their own national instant payment scheme, but this will now become a reality across Europe. Good for citizens and companies who can send and receive their money faster. Second, security: the IBAN name check – as some banks are already using in my country, the Netherlands – is now introduced across Europe, making transactions more secure than ever. Third, we make our markets less dependent on foreign companies for both online and card payments. Fourth, openness and innovation: fintechs will also gain access to the payments infrastructure, but even market vendors will be able, in theory, to set up their own QR system for receiving instant payments. No more high costs to rent a payment terminal in order to be connected to the payment infrastructure. It is high time that instant payments become a reality: for European citizens, as they will enjoy smoother payment options; for European businesses, as they will face lower costs; and for European payment services, as they will become more and more competitive. I enthusiastically welcome the trilogue agreement, which clearly shows the ambition that Europe needs. Ambition on scope, for example, by the inclusion of payment institutions and electronic money institutions, as insisted by the Parliament. This should enhance innovation. Ambition on fees, most notably by requiring that charges for instant payments may not be higher than charges for traditional, non-instant payments. Such affordability is the key to realising the maximum benefits for consumers. And last but not least, ambition on the entry into force of this regulation; the Parliament negotiating team has successfully negotiated implementation deadlines in the very near future. Let me conclude by thanking the Commission – Commissioner McGuinness – for an excellent proposal, and the Spanish Presidency and my colleagues, shadow rapporteurs, for the constructive collaboration during our negotiations.",ECR,2024-02-05,14.

While there is and should continue to be a place for cash payments in today’s society, the reality is that personal and business finance has become more and more digitised. Instant transfer banking, such as Revolut, has become very popular for a reason. The nature and means by which people transfer money has changed and we should embrace this shift. While instant payments have been offered in the EU for a number of years, with this legislation, instant payments in euros will become a requirement, not a possibility, for payment service providers. This is good news for customers, as the proposals would require banks to be capable of receiving and sending instant payments without surcharge and across all channels, with payments capped at EUR 100 000. This is particularly important for Irish consumers, as none of the Irish retail banks currently provide their customers with the ability to transfer money instantly. Relying on transfers that can take up to three working days is holding us back, and I support measures that mandate instant payment services, as we can see how efficient and convenient the technology is. However, it is very important that enough time be given to implement this change securely. The last thing we want to see is unnecessary risks to our bank system security. Fortunately, this legislation also provides provisions to make transfers more trustworthy. This is a good news story for consumers, making instant euro payments affordable and accessible to citizens.

Mairead McGuinness,"Madam President, colleagues, I was almost was going to say ‘let me second the speech of the rapporteur’ and maybe start with a big thank you to Michiel Hoogeveen, because you worked tirelessly and effectively with the shadows to get this piece of legislation done in a very timely manner. The matter of instant payments should not be new, but it is not the norm and won’t be unless this legislation is in place. Instant payments are a very practical issue for all of us, businesses and citizens. The idea is very simple, allowing all of us to send and receive money in less than 10 seconds. Instant payments have a really powerful impact: consumers can easily avoid penalties for late payments and manage their household budgets more effectively. Businesses get better cash flow, which is really important for SMEs. Retailers get more options around payments, allowing them to offer better services to their customers, including instant refunds. NGOs and charities can receive contributions more quickly, especially when funds are urgently needed in times of crisis. In the public sector, too, there’s advantages in terms of cash flow and collecting fiscal revenues. Now we are not trailblazing in this area: this regulation will allow the EU to catch up with international markets like Brazil, India, Australia and the UK, where instant payments are growing fast. The technology to provide for instant payments is well established and, frankly, uptake has been too low in the EU. But your work in this chamber, and the colleagues who specifically worked on the file: your work will make a difference, it will change matters for the better. And I repeat the fact that you worked very effectively and in a timely way, and we would say that this is rare indeed on files in the European system. As Gaeilge, that’s in Irish, we would say ‘an rud is annamh is iontach’ – ‘what’s seldom is wonderful’. The outcome of the negotiations struck a very good balance: Parliament helped make sure that the regulation is ambitious, and your work has also been welcomed by both payment service users and providers. You led important changes, allowing payment institutions and electronic money institutions to become eligible to participate in designated payment systems, improving consumer protection against fraud with your changes to the payment verification service, where providers will have to enable users to check whether the name and the IBAN match. This service will now be made available not just for instant payments, but for all non-instant payments, and this verification service will be provided to all users free of charge. I really do look forward to the vote on Wednesday. Colleagues, there are some files which test all our patience and reserves, but happily this is not one of them.",-,2024-02-05,14.

Martine Kemp,"Madam President, dear colleagues. According to the Commission, nearly EUR 200 billion are temporarily blocked every day due to delays in payments, losing as a result an economic benefit of EUR 1.8 billion per year. Yes, you heard that right – the inefficiency of the European payment system costs us almost EUR 2 billion per year. Such inoperability has been having a tremendous impact, not only on the efficient management of the household budgets of our citizens, especially of young people who have grown up in a digitalised world, but also on our SMEs, which are the backbone of our economy that lose control of their limited cash flows, and our NGOs and charities whose rapid action is urgently needed, particularly in times of crisis. Dear colleagues, let’s face the truth – this reality is unacceptable for the biggest trading bloc of the world. Therefore, I very much welcome the Commission proposal that finally tackles the roots of the issue, making instant euro payments universally available and affordable, while increasing the level of trust and removing the level of friction in its processing. I say ‘finally’, because as a leading European country for instant payments, Luxembourg has been advocating for the key importance of the matter for quite some time. This is a position that we hold because of our high level of awareness, awareness that must be spread to the whole union in order to avoid fragmentation – a demon that our community is fighting so hard to beat.",PPE,2024-02-05,14.

Irene Shashar,"Honourable President of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, honourable Members of the European Parliament, honourable Ambassadors and Permanent Representatives, honourable Vice-Presidents and Members of the European Commission, honourable President of the European Economic and Social Committee, honourable religious representatives, ladies and gentlemen, at this International Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony, I stand here today in front of you to tell you: Hitler did not win! The year is 1942. I am five years old. My mother, father and I are living in the Warsaw Ghetto. We are starving. In my innocence, I hoped that it was all temporary. I wanted to believe that someone would say ‘abracadabra’ and I would be back in my own rightful home, comfortable and secure, surrounded by my family’s love. But that was only a child’s dream. Moving to the ghetto was only the beginning of our nightmare. The seeds of genocide had already been planted in 1939 with the poison of Nazism invading Poland. When we were forcibly moved into the ghetto, survival was the only thing that mattered. The conditions in the ghetto were awful. I was cold, I was barefoot, I was hungry. I was afraid to look into the eyes of a stranger. My mother and I often went to scavenge for food while my father would stay in our tiny apartment. On one of these outings, as my mother was holding me tight, I noticed a dirty, raw potato that had fallen off a food cart. I picked it up, I gave it to my mother; she cleaned it with her skirt, she broke it in half for me to eat. I ate it with delight. I still remember its taste. It was delicious. The second half of the potato, I expected my mother to eat herself, since she was just as hungry as I was. But she waited. She waited until I finished savouring the first half and gave me the second half. I’m telling you this to show you that a mother’s love is unconditional. On another afternoon, while my mother and I were again searching the streets for spare bits of food, we heard bloodcurdling screams coming in the direction of our cramped ‘apartment’. My mother yanked my little arm and took off running in the direction of the screams. She dashed up the stairs of our building, fighting her way through a crowd of people, and once we were there on the landing, the crowd was even thicker. But through the open door we could see a body – a body sprawled on the kitchen floor. It was my father, in his ratty dress shirt and his shlaikes, or suspenders, lying there, bleeding from a gash on the side of his throat. Mother dragged me with her. She threw herself and me on top of his limp body and screamed, sobbing inconsolably. I was scared. She kept an iron grip on me as we huddled together as a family for one last time. My elbow had nowhere to go except into a pool of my father’s blood. We stayed there for what felt like an eternity. Finally, somebody pulled me away and took me out of the room. I remember then feeling relieved, but that would be the last time I ever saw my father. Shortly after that horrific day, mother and I set out to find some food. Only on this day, something felt different. She was carrying a large black bag and she let me take my doll, my beloved Laleczka. She seemed to be going somewhere with a purpose, with urgency, with a plan. Suddenly she pulled open a sewer cover and tossed me down the sewer. It was dark, it was dirty, it was wet, it was awful. And all I could see, all I could feel, was the stream of smelly water splashing against me. I clutched my beloved Laleczka and waited for my mother to join me. My eyes slowly but surely adjusted to the darkness, and I saw the grimy tunnel all around me. And the rats – there were lots, lots, lots, lots of rats. They were jumping. They were jumping on my head, on my face. They were in my hair and they were jumping on my poor Laleczka. My mother pushed me from behind to move us through the foul gutter. Not only was it soggy, but there was a tremendous stench. We were crossing the sewer for the entire ghetto area of Warsaw. 80 years later, I can remember the stench like it was yesterday. I clutched my travel companion, my beloved Laleczka, close to my chest. I told her to be strong, but neither she nor I were immune to the horrific conditions in the sewer. She was more than my precious doll, she was my best friend, and even she was not safe in this hell on earth. Then, as quickly and forcefully as it had begun, the pushing from behind suddenly stopped. My mother scrambled upward. Somehow, she found a grate. She hoisted me up and then came out of the sewer herself. To this day, I still wonder, how did she know how far we had to go in order to emerge outside of the ghetto walls? We were now on the Arian side of Warsaw, where Jews were absolutely forbidden to be. My mother, a pretty woman, was blonde and blue-eyed, and could pass as a non-Jew. She had friends from earlier years who were willing to employ her in their homes, even though this was dangerous for them. Now, in this situation, she could provide food for herself and for me. However, taking me along required that I be hidden in closets. From that moment on, I became what is known as a ‘Holocaust hidden child’. I was given a potty for my Laleczka and for myself, and my mother came by every once in a while with food and a kiss, and to tell me how much she loved me. I spent hours and hours in dark closets talking to my Laleczka. We comforted each other. We hugged each other. She was my hiding place companion. I asked her over and over again, what did I do wrong? Why am I being punished? I felt guilty, guilty of something, but of what I did not know. My mother told me that if I behaved, if I would not call her, if I would not complain, if I would not make any noise, all this would soon be over and then we could go out to the park to play again. Ladies and gentlemen, consider for a moment: what my mother was telling me was that the end of the war depended on my being good. Could I really be responsible for ending the war? After several years of hiding and running, running to new places to stay one step ahead of the Gestapo, the war was finally over – I must have been very, very, very good! We searched for surviving relatives and eventually we made our way to Paris. My mother found a job in a hotel, but there was no place for me there. So she sent me to an orphanage, Le Manoir de Denouval, in Andrésy, established by the Commission Centrale de l’Énfance created by the Union des Juifs pour la Résistance et l’Entraide. All the children in there were French orphans whose parents had been deported to death camps. I was the only Polish child. I was also the only child with the mother, so she became everybody’s mother. At the Manoir, I learned for the first time to read and write. I was then nine years old. Thank you, France, for having provided me with a refuge at a crucial time in my life. There were so many questions I wanted to ask my mother, who was my saviour, and who gave me life over and over again. She died in the spring of 1948, before I was able to ask, and I then became a full orphan. Prior though, to her sudden heart attack, she had one last plan. She made arrangements, for her and for me, to live with her favourite niece, whose family had found a new life in Lima, Peru. Fela Topilsky and her husband Michal had the generosity to take me in, gave me love and allowed me to start a new life in the safety of their home, together with their children, Marcel and Sonia. I am forever thankful and grateful for their love and generosity. They helped make me the person that I am today, and I tried to show that I deserved their caring by being, of course, the best student, the best I could be. Later, I earned a scholarship to university in the United States. Peru provided me with an environment in which I could evolve from a hidden refugee child to an adolescent with hopes and dreams for the future. Thank you, Peru. My mother’s foresight, even after she was no longer with me, is a beacon of light that has stayed with me throughout my life. I went to New York to study and, eventually, from there, made aliah to Israel. Israel became my country. I had the privilege to contribute to the education of generations of students at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem during the 40 years I taught applied linguistics there. I was blessed with the opportunity to have children and grandchildren, and I did the very thing Hitler tried so hard to prevent. But Hitler did not win. Allow me to present to you my victory: my son, David, and my daughter, Illana. Would the two of you please stand up? My son, David, is a doctor. In 2006, he was seriously injured while serving in the IDF when he joined a paratrooper unit that was attacked. He overcame his injuries and founded an emerging biotech company that is in the process of developing an innovative device to reduce newborn mortality by delaying or preventing premature births. His wife, Rotem, is an intensive care nurse who treats seriously injured patients of all races and religions. She has been working non-stop since 7 October. They have three children: 13-year-old Nevo, gifted in mathematics, who just celebrated his Bar Mitzvah at the Wailing Wall; 10-year-old Omer, who is an artistic gymnast and aspires to be an Olympic medallist; and Doron, the seven-year-old, who regularly charms all of us. My daughter, Illana, is a senior social worker and trauma specialist in the Municipality of Shoham. Since the unprovoked attack on Israel on 7 October, she has been on the frontline of the war at home, leading support groups to help the community deal with the trauma of the war. Helping families of hostages who have been released back home, and helping those that are still waiting for their loved ones to come back. Illana’s husband, Assaf, is an expert on law and psychiatry. He immediately volunteered to join his reserve unit on 7 October. They share four children. Yarden, aged 20, is doing his military service, as are almost all 20 year olds in Israel. He’s a soldier in an elite unit and we pray every day, we pray for his safe return home. Yahel, 15, was one of several thousand students who was accepted into an elite boarding school in Haifa, and she’s interested in maths and biology, and hopes to become a doctor. Shirah, 13, loves skating and participates in national competitions. And the last one, Ivri, 11, is a good student, has a wonderful sense of humour, and is a competitive swimmer. My grandchildren have their whole future in front of them, and it breaks my heart to see them growing up in war. I hoped, and I believed – I did believe – that I had paid the price. And yet, my grandchildren must fight to defend their right to life in a Jewish state. Unfortunately, as I stand here before you, I have left my country in the wake of violence, murder, rape and terror. After more than 100 days, there’s still 136 kidnapped hostages, dead or alive, in the hands of the terrorists. Friends, I ask for your solidarity and your support to see those hostages reunited with their families. The entire country yearns to have them back alive. Help bring them back alive! Sadly, after 7 October, the resurgence of anti-Semitism means that the hate of the past is still with us. Jews are again not feeling safe living in Europe. After the Holocaust, this should be unacceptable. ‘Never again’ should truly mean NEVER AGAIN. I am now 86 years old. When I was born, Europe was still a collection of states with major grievances against each other. Europe was able, in the meantime, to set aside old hatred and come together. I truly believe that the values that inspired the European unity – respect for diversity, respect for freedom of religion, and the ability to live together in peace – have an important role to play in the future of the Middle East. I have a dream. In my dream, my children, all children, live in a peaceful Middle East, one that is free of hate, especially towards us, the Jews. In my dream, the Jews find safety and security anywhere – anywhere they choose to call home – and anti-Semitism is finally a thing of the past. I won against Hitler. I am finally home. But my grandchildren must now fight for its survival. I call upon you, the Parliament of Europe, to help my dream come true. Together, only together with you, we can end anti-Semitism and achieve lasting peace. Thank you. Gracias. Merci. Dziekuje. Danke. Gracie. Obrigada. (Loud and sustained applause)",-,2024-01-25,4.

President,"Today the European Parliament marks International Holocaust Remembrance Day. We pay tribute to the memory of the victims of the Holocaust and reaffirm our unwavering commitment to counter anti-Semitism, racism and all other forms of hate. Europe remembers. I invite you first to view a video depicting the horror of the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp as seen from the eyes of one of its survivors – the first female president of the European Parliament, Simone Veil. (The video ‘Une Vie’ was shown) Dear colleagues, dear dignitaries, dear Irene Shashar, every year at the end of January, this Parliament marks the anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi Concentration and Extermination Camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau in 1945. We remember the victims of the Holocaust. We remember the six million Jewish people, Romani people, LGBT communities and many others who were stripped of their dignity because of their religious faith, their ethnicity, race or disability. The path that led to Auschwitz and the Holocaust began generations before – with scapegoating, bullying and dehumanisation. It began with ostracising those seen as ‘different’, by blaming ‘the other’. The German Nazi regime exterminated 17 million men, women and children and inflicted unimaginable suffering and pain on millions more, while others’ silence stood complicit. As one survivor put it – ‘The truly horrific thing was the absence of horror of so many’. The comfort of indifference meant too many closed their eyes and turned away. I am proud that the European Parliament is not a place of indifference. I am proud that this House speaks up against Holocaust deniers, against conspiracy myths, against disinformation and against violence that deliberately targets and singles out members of our communities. Because, despite decades of effort, we have not yet done enough to combat discrimination. Dear Irene, we are honoured to have you in the European Parliament, for this solemn ceremony of remembrance. The European Parliament understands its responsibility. In the video, we heard Simone Veil’s recollection of the horrors of Auschwitz – with the number 7-8-6-5-1 tattooed under her skin. She survived the evil of concentration camps and changed the face of modern Europe. Although, dear Irene, none of us can fathom the extent of the pain that you suffered, and you being a Hidden Child during the war – with nothing but your beloved doll Laleczka as your sole companion – we will listen to your story. We will take your lessons with us. We will remember. On Holocaust Remembrance day, we recall the importance of sharing stories like yours, today and for generations to follow, of protecting our values. The story of Europe is one of ideals and values. It is one of overcoming tragedy, of building bridges between peoples, of turning enemies into partners and friends, of building from the ashes. Over the years, our Union has transformed the lives of millions. We tore down barriers and replaced them with common values. We achieved freedom, guaranteed prosperity, and provided opportunity. We must continue to remember Europe’s story, to remember its horrors and to treasure its accomplishment in overcoming them, to understand where we came from, and why, and to teach these lessons to our children. Ladies and gentlemen, We remember. I would like now to invite you all to listen to Marcelo Nisinman – a composer and performer of the bandoneon. He composed this piece especially for today’s Holocaust Remembrance Day event in the European Parliament.

Tilly Metz,"Madam President, I will be very short, don’t worry. So, dear colleagues, the Claims Regulation applies to voluntary, nutritional and health claims on food products and food supplements in all commercial communication. The objective of the regulation is a high level of consumer protection and smooth functioning of the internal market. We want to protect European consumers, their safety, their health, but let’s be honest, also their wallet. The regulation has been enforced for more than 15 years, and I think we can agree that it has significantly contributed to protecting consumers from false and misleading health and nutrition claims on food. But still today, consumers continue to be exposed to unauthorised and misleading claims. The report we vote on today addresses key challenges in the implementation and suggests the regulation might need to be updated. So, we have three issues. Very shortly, consumers continue to be exposed to very unhealthy foods with authorised claims because 15 years after the regulation came into force, the foreseen nutrition thresholds for such claims have still not been established. Secondly, there is an on-hold list with over 2 000 claims on botanicals. Due to a lack of data, EFSA stopped evaluating these claims and the Commission put the claims on hold over a decade ago. This anomaly needs to be addressed. And thirdly, and lastly, online sales of food and supplements with unauthorised claims are booming. More cooperation and guidance are needed for successful implementation of this regulation in the online environment.

The questions raised concerning food safety and animal welfare are key policy issues for the Commission and, of course, for the public and address matters that have always been taken very seriously. The specific issues that you have raised, such as residues of veterinary medicines, animal welfare, illegal cross-border movement and traceability, were all identified during the audits the Commission services have conducted in these two countries. The identified shortcomings are the basis of recommendations made in the respective reports. In response, the authorities from both countries have provided written guarantees that appropriate corrective actions are being taken. The action plans include clear timelines for implementing a system of individual identification and traceability of horses. They also include actions to prevent the use of testosterone in horses intended for export, and measures to improve animal welfare. The proposed horse traceability improvements will address the risk of smuggling identified by the Uruguayan authorities. We are closely working with the authorities in these countries to ensure these measures are fully implemented. In parallel, we maintain systems to assess how exporting countries monitor their products for the presence of veterinary medicinal residues. The Commission is assured that the actions proposed by both countries to address the shortcomings would, if fully implemented, mean that the certificates can be issued in line with the relevant guarantees, ensuring the appropriate level of food safety. We will remain in close contact with the authorities of Uruguay and Argentina to ensure that only products that are in compliance with the EU requirements on imports are in place on the EU market. We will closely monitor the implementation of the action plans and any non-compliances that are identified in the future.",-,2024-01-18,10.

Mick Wallace,"Madam President, audits carried out in Argentina and Uruguay highlight once again the major issues with animal welfare, traceability and food safety for these countries. Poorly treated horses are commonly given drugs that are prohibited in the EU, and the traceability systems in place are unreliable, as they rely on the honesty of horse owners and dealers, leaving it wide open for fraud. As a result, horses of unknown origin and an unclear drug history, as well as stolen and smuggled horses, enter the food chain, which poses a high food-safety risk for European consumers. The farm to fork strategy, passed overwhelmingly in here in 2021, called on the Commission to suspend the import of horsemeat from countries where applicable EU requirements relating to traceability and animal welfare are not complied with.

We never acknowledge the others – the hard limits that our politics and our culture puts on its freedom. Look at how our media has covered Israel’s genocidal assault on Gaza. If the media isn’t uncritically repeating Israel’s blatant lies, it is tying itself up in knots to avoid exposing them for what they are. It relentlessly downplays Israeli genocide, berates grieving Palestinians for not condemning Hamas enough. Israelis are ‘killed by bloodthirsty Palestinians’ while Israeli bullets ‘find their way into the heads’ of Palestinian children. Our media gives Israelis names; Palestinians are statistics.

Virginijus Sinkevičius,"Mr President, honourable Members, let me start by thanking Ms Bilbao, the shadow rapporteurs and the entire PECH Committee for the work done on this own initiative report, which the Commission welcomes. I’m happy to see that most of your findings concur with the Commission’s own report that we adopted in February 2023. In particular, we both conclude that the Common Market Organisation Regulation generally remains fit for purpose. Allow me to share the Commission’s views. I also agree that the producer organisations play a key role, and that more efforts are necessary to support the implementation and financing of their production and marketing plans, and these remain, of course, a responsibility of the Member States. Nevertheless, the Commission works closely with concerned parties to facilitate the implementation of the plans and provide guidance. I know how important the recognition of producer organisations such as cofradías and Prud’homies is for you. Cofradías and Prud’homies are welcome to adapt their structures in line with the rules. And in all my meetings with fishing communities where this issue was raised, I have always reiterated the Commission readiness to assess in that process. Regarding the difficulties for small-scale producers to set up producer organisations. I can reassure you that the national programmes under the EMFAF address these challenges, and the Commission continues to provide guidance here. On your call to improve marketing standards and consumer information, I fully agree that proper labelling is essential for the trust of consumers. A better consumer information relies on three elements. First of all, full traceability. Here, the timely implementation of the new Fisheries Control Regulation is crucial. Secondly, compliance by Member States with the regulation on the Common Market Organisation. And this is an area which we will prioritise in 2024. And third, consumer rights to an informed choice. Here we will work in 2024 towards a methodology to score some sustainability aspects for fisheries and aquaculture products. The report also mentions the need to include marketing standards in measures adopted in regional fisheries management organisations. Unfortunately, marketing standards are not covered by these organisations, but conservation and other control measures are in place to ensure sustainable fisheries. The report highlights the need to increase the use of quality schemes and to have a greater variety of quality schemes. The Commission, however, thinks that there is no need for more quality schemes, as the existing types seem to be wide enough to promote the specificities of European fishery and aquaculture products, and the best example is in the context of the quality scheme of the geographical indications, which increased by 240% over the last decade in the EU. However, I can agree with you that the producer to obtain a quality scheme needs to be improved. So therefore, the Commission adopted a proposal in March 2022 to revise the Geographical Indications Regulations. The report also includes a call to forbid the use of the word fish, or the name of fish species for plant-based products. The current EU rules already provide a solid framework to ensure that consumers are not misled. Regarding the mechanism to trigger financial aid under the Regulation on the Common Market Organisation in the event of a crisis, let me recall that crisis support already exists under the EMFAF. The Commission closely monitors market development and the continuing conditions to trigger it. So thank you for your attention and thank you for this excellent report.",-,2024-01-18,5.

Virginijus Sinkevičius,"Mr President, Members of the Parliament, thank you very much for this enriching debate, which has helped us to clarify and share our views regarding the action plan, but also reaffirm once more that we all want to remedy the negative environmental impacts, because the future of our fisheries will depend on our ability to react and adapt. And let me now come to some points that you have raised. First of all, on impact assessment, the action plan is not a legal proposal. In addition, it is based on existing legislation, which impact assessments have been done and they were being adopted. Finally, the design and implementation of the measures is left to Member States, so they are best placed to judge what is needed and what the impact will be, and on that basis, ensure a balanced approach. It also has been explained on multiple occasions that the action plan does not intend to impose any legal measure. The action plan simply calls for a renewed political commitment to make the measures work involving the Commission, Parliament, the Council and Member States. It presents the CFP regionalisation process as the right framework for the measures proposed to be implemented. In addition, the Technical Measures Regulation also places the regionalisation in a privileged position. On bottom-trawling, again, we had a multiple exchanges on that, we’ve heard it quite a few times today. Dear Members of the Parliament, we need a transition to better protection of the seabed, including through the less damaging gears, but also to gears to ensure less fuel consumption. Because when the Russia attacked Ukraine, our fishers were left without income. Why? Because of their dependence on fossil fuels. And the fishing techniques that they are using today are unfortunately heavily dependent on fossil fuels, and we cannot keep them in this position where the whole livelihood, the income of their families, would be busted due to events happening in the world. We need to protect them and this is essential. The last thing on dialogue, you know, I myself, throughout this mandate, have visited all sea basins. I’ve talked with different communities in different parts of Europe, talked with the fishers from the Mediterranean to Baltic, Bay of Biscay even, a few times. We’ve been constantly involving fishers in this dialogue. I have accepted them on multiple occasions in Brussels. We had challenging times, starting the mandate with the Brexit issue and going through the COVID-19 crisis, and also, as I’ve said, Russia’s war against Ukraine. On all these occasions, I always had the privilege to meet the fishers and answer the questions about their future, and I will do so, same as you, Members of Parliament. So, you know, to say that there was a lack of dialogue is absolutely not true. We have been always involved and they were part of the dialogue as regards the action plan. The last thing, on the Bay of Biscay, as I see Mr Bellamy is still in the room, the very important thing to take from the Bay of Biscay, I think we don’t need to wait for national courts’ decisions to implement EU legislation, because when the national court decisions are announced, unfortunately it’s too late. I think we can prevent such things from happening and then ensure the livelihood of the fishers in different sea basins across Europe. Dear colleagues, in conclusion, the principle of regionalisation is the right framework to implement measures proposed in the action plan, so therefore it should be fully used to implement necessary measures to protect habitats and species. If we want the EU to continue being a leading actor on global marine conservation, we need to lead the transition to sustainability. So the benefits that ocean provides will be enjoyed also by the future generations, including future fishers. I count on the commitment of this House to work jointly with the Commission in the pursuit of the biodiversity goal, so we can offer our citizens the highest standards of marine conservation and supply of high-quality seafood, while ensuring the livelihoods of European fishing communities also in the future.",-,2024-01-18,4.

Virginijus Sinkevičius,"Mr President, honourable Members, given the cumulative crisis we have been or are still faced with, be it climate change or the loss of natural resources, COVID-19 or the energy crisis, it is our collective responsibility to help the EU fisheries and aquaculture sectors to become more resilient so that they can continue to provide citizens with high-quality food. I would like to, first of all, start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Mato, and all shadow rapporteurs for the work they have put into this report, and I truly welcome that it acknowledges the importance and the merits of the common fisheries policy and of its main objective to achieve environmental, economic and social sustainability. I agree with you that the compliance and implementation of the landing obligations remain challenging. Your report asked for a socio-economic impact analysis, which the Commission has already carried out in 2022 and which has shown that the landing obligation so far has not had a big impact, including socio-economically, as unfortunately, it is not consistently complied with. Regarding the call to assess alternative ways to minimise unwanted catches, we would first need to know what the upcoming evaluation of the landing obligation bring and, as you know well, the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund already provides effective support to more selective and less impacting fishing techniques. One point on which the Commission cannot agree is that to decarbonise our fishing fleet, to ensure generational renewal or to increase safety on board, we need to necessarily increase the fishing capacity limits. It is crucial that the size of the fleet remains in balance with the available fishing opportunities if we want to ensure sustainable fisheries management. Besides, several member states have a non-negligible margin between the active capacity of their fleets and their fishing capacity ceiling, and they can – and should – allocate this margin where needed to facilitate the modernisation of the fleet. I have called on those Member States on several occasions to look into this, and I reiterate this call today. Supporting the fishing fleet in its energy transition will remain one of our big joint responsibilities for the years to come. To facilitate this transition, the Commission has already proposed a number of concrete measures under its energy transition initiative, and we have also issued a guide on funding opportunities to support stakeholders in navigating the different types of funding that can be used. The ‘fishers of the future’ project, which we launched last February, will also look at the generational renewal and safety on board. I fully agree with you that the promotion of low-impact aquaculture practices, such as mussel or oyster farming, needs more support. In line with your report, the strategic guidelines on EU aquaculture recognise that future research and innovation is required, in particular on species-specific welfare parameters. The Commission is therefore committed to support such research in the current programming period of EU funds, and will certainly support effective implementation of these strategic guidelines. A number of funding opportunities are available to achieve the energy transition and other objectives under the European Green Deal, including under Horizon Europe and REPower EU, and for that purpose, we also revised the state aid guidelines and ensured the necessary synergies with the European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund. Let me also be very clear that the Commission is fully committed to ensure equal treatment of women in the fisheries sector and their improved representation. We have launched a specific call for proposals under the European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund to support projects promoting the role of women in the blue economy, the so-called WINBLUE and WIN-BIG. I am grateful to you, Mr Mato, that in your report, you also addressed climate change, and in that context, more specifically, the changes we see in the oceans’ chemistry and temperature. This is a key challenge, and we need to continue to carefully monitor any future developments and take them into account when taking policy decisions. The European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund already helps the fisheries and aquaculture sector to adapt to the consequences of climate change. However, the uptake of the available funds by Member States has, unfortunately, been relatively limited until now. So this needs to change and I count on your support in this regard. Your report also sets out very concrete ideas regarding regional fisheries management organisations, and I can only reiterate the reassurance I have given to you on previous occasions: that the rights of the European Parliament regarding the negotiations within these organisations are – and will always be – fully respected in line with the framework agreement that governs the relations between our two institutions. So, the Commission supports the creation of new regional fisheries management organisations. However, this comes with its own set of political challenges. Of course, the Commission remains fully committed to involve the European Parliament in all future policy developments, in line with our treaty obligations and in line with our agreed better regulations principles, and it will continue to conduct evaluations or impact assessments when preparing new initiatives involving all stakeholders, including our fishers.",-,2024-01-18,3.

This was confirmed by the European Court of Auditors in 2020.

The environmental status of 60% of these commercial fish populations is unknown, and the environmental status of 41% of non-commercial fish species is also unknown.

Virginijus Sinkevičius,"Mr President, honourable Members, good morning. Plastic pellet spills, like the recent event on the Spanish coast or the French coast last year, give rise to a wave of public concern. Such accidents are occasional, but they create sudden and significant negative impacts on some regions. Other regions have been struggling with the endemic pollution by plastic pellets due to poor handling at every stage of the supply chain, and such pollution may not have been always as visible as in major accidents, but it has nonetheless harmful impacts on soils and waters, on lives and livelihoods. So the need for action is clear. That’s why in October last year, the Commission put forward a proposal for a regulation on preventing plastic pellet losses. The primary focus is on prevention because once pellets enter the environment, they are difficult and costly to capture. And I would like to thank Parliament for giving priority to the work of this proposal in such a busy period of time. Coming back to the case at hand, let me begin with the tools that we already have at EU level to assist. The EU system hosted in the European Maritime Safety Agency allows the sharing of information between countries on containers lost at sea. It was duly activated in this case. Other forms of EU support are available through the Emergency Response Coordination Centre, EU Civil Protection Mechanism, for example, and the EU Solidarity Fund. Support might be also available from funds such as the European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund and Cohesion Funds. So the reasons for the fall remain to be investigated as well as the responsibilities. In the meantime, the clean-up is ongoing, but these operations are costly in terms of time and equipment, and they are also very challenging, especially at sea. That is why accidental and operational losses should be best avoided in the first place, and when losses occur, the polluter pays principle must apply. So the Commission proposal on plastic pellet losses requires economic operators to act in the following order. Firstly, they have to take action to prevent any spills. Then comes the containment obligation to ensure that spill pellets do not leak to the environment. And thirdly, if pellets pollute the environment, the clean-up must be ensured. So the proposal covers operators that produce, store or convert plastic pellets into products, and EU and non-EU carriers transporting pellets by road, rail and inland waterways in the Union. Given the international nature of maritime transport, this sector was not included in the proposal, so the Commission is, however, actively working at the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to tackle highly complex matter. The IMO is examining the issue of plastic pellets transportation in containers intensively, notably on three aspects. So firstly, good quality packaging to withstand the shocks and handling normally encountered during transport. Second, transport information to clearly identify those freight containers containing plastic pellets, and thirdly, safe storage to minimise the hazards to the marine environment. Specifically, freight containers with plastic pellets should be stored under deck whenever possible or on board in sheltered areas of exposed decks. So we are determined, with the support of the Member States, to speed up this work with the International Maritime Organisation and help take decisions. This would avoid ending up with a patchwork of different regional and national rules, and in particular, given that many containers are loaded onto ships in ports outside the EU. So it is important that these rules are agreed and adopted worldwide to be effective. At the same time, we are ready to consider the inclusion of further provisions in EU law on the basis of the developments at the International Maritime Organisation. So this could include a ban on the carriage of pellets in bulk, and also tighter rules on the quality of packaging and the transport of pellets in the main body of ships. In this way, we would already reduce the risk of pellets washing up on our beaches. Protecting coastal and marine ecosystems is in the interests of all. The EU’s blue economy sectors including fisheries, aquaculture and coastal tourism are directly affected by plastic pellet pollution. So we need firm action by all parties involved, as sea waters are transboundary and this will require close cooperation among Member States. Despite our efforts, the sea remains unpredictable and at times a dangerous place to operate, so adverse weather conditions may unavoidably lead to catastrophic events. It is then that remediation solutions are necessary, so the Commission will pursue the evaluation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, which already contains provisions to protect the marine environment against harm caused by litter. The Environmental Liability Directive, which offers limited protection in this regard, will also be subject to evaluation. The Commission will continue to contribute to the research guidance, promotion and support of best handling practice with a view to reducing any possible effects caused by plastic pellet losses. Reducing microplastic pollution is also an objective of the EU Mission ‘Restore Our Ocean and Waters’, which is developing and demonstrating innovative solutions to prevent, eliminate and monitor microplastics in our ocean and waters. Finally, I would like to point out the new international instrument on plastic pollution that is currently being negotiated. Let me stress the importance of including a legally binding provision to prevent release of plastics into the environment through the life cycle. I am confident that together, we will find the best way to deal with the current crisis and pave the way to preventing such crises in the future. This entails the rapid adoption of the proposal on plastic pellets, and I am sure that we are all united in our determination to do all we can to avert such ecological disasters.",-,2024-01-18,2.

Deirdre Clune,"Mr President, Commissioner, as we speak today, hundreds of workers and volunteers are working day and night to clean up those millions of plastic pellets that have washed up on their shores in Galicia. They are doing so because they want to protect their environment, their fishing, their shellfish industry and their livelihoods in the tourism sector. They’re asking questions, such as: how did this happen? Could it have been prevented? Could the extent of the damage that we are seeing today have been reduced? Why was there such a delay before they saw action and support from their government? What happened from the 8 December 2023 to 3 January 2024? Why did it take so long for their regional government to be informed so that they could take action? They want to know what’s to be done at European level, to prevent, to minimise and to better coordinate a response to such a serious event in the future. It has to be noted that the company responsible for the transport of these pellets did act and inform as soon as they could. They will investigate how it happened and they will contribute to the clean—up. I am glad to see that the Spanish Public Prosecutor has started an investigation. We must provide answers, but we must also give direction as to how such a scenario can be avoided or reduced in the future. This spillage has brought into focus the regulation on preventing microplastic pollution that’s currently being considered here in this Parliament, a regulation that aims to see measures applied across the plastic industry chain to reduce pellet lost by up to 70%. I want to see the adoption of this report, a practical regulation that will be effective.

The catastrophe off the coast of Portugal and Spain actually involved six containers. What we see in the reports, it goes for the US vessel El Faro and for the EVER SMART, is that the containers are usually stacked in a criminal way. In the future, with more storms you’re going to have more problems, more catastrophes, if we don’t get the vessels in order. The equipment is bad, the vessels are old and they are stacked in a way which is not according to the rules. So what you have on the top of a stack is a too-heavy container. When the ship starts rolling 20% to the left and to starboard and port, then you have it there.

Unlike the transport of materials like crude oil, which is classified as a hazard to transport, there is still no such regulation for the transport of crude plastics. This must change. The petrochemical plastic industries cannot be defended.

If that doesn’t happen, they drill. Do you know what they will find? They will find plastic. There’s so much plastic. Ska calculated there is 100 billion tonnes every year. There is a great plastic garbage patch – Plastic Island –in the Pacific Ocean, which is three times the size of France. And there are five of these islands, and we produce more and more plastic. So dear Commissioner Sinkevičius, when this mandate began, we talked about a blue deal. And you’ve done a great job. You pushed forward the ocean agreement at the Biodiversity COP15 Kunming-Montreal. You reached an agreement on the Beyond National Jurisdiction Agreement (High Seas Treaty). I think it is time to be serious about our zero pollution commitment on the Green Deal, talk about the next mandate and realise that we must stop the plastic addiction. Plastics are fossil fuels, and the people of Galicia are suffering from another oil spill, like Grace said, 20 years later.

Virginijus Sinkevičius,"Mr President, honourable Members, first of all, what is very clear is that today’s debate shows the importance of tackling pollution by plastic pellets as well as the complexity of this issue. There are no easy solutions, but we do need bold and decisive action to protect our oceans and to deliver on the zero pollution target. We are committed to reducing plastic litter at sea by 50% and microplastics released into the environment by 30% by 2030. Some may be inclined to look at these targets as sort of nice figures, but when pollution strikes for real, like on the Spanish coast, we see that environmental concerns climb to the top of the political agenda. So success will depend on our joint coordinated efforts to support decisive and rapid actions and decisions at all relevant levels. Regarding maritime transport, dear colleagues, I heard your request and we are ready to consider its inclusion in EU law. For instance, to forbid the carriage of pellets in bulk and to work together on ensuring good quality packaging and safe storage on board ships. We are also calling on all parties involved to act at international level.

The pollution of our sea with over a billion plastic pellets is a huge disaster for the environment, for marine animals and for local communities, but this disaster is not even 1% of the plastic pallets lost every single year. We need to stop this ongoing catastrophe. No one is gaining anything from unused plastic pellets, flakes or powders getting lost. It’s high time to give clear requirements to producers, handlers and carriers of plastic raw materials to make sure that plastic pellet losses are prevented and, if they happen, that they are reported and that there is a liability for those carriers and handlers. The Commission has put forward a proposal that I very much welcome, and I am sure the Parliament will make sure that this legislation will become even stronger and more waterproof. Let’s not wait until more disasters are happening in Galicia or elsewhere. Let’s put an end to this wasteful handling of our very limited resources.

Ska Keller,"Mr President, dear colleagues, our oceans and seas are central for human survival. They provide us with the air that we breathe. They function as a massive carbon sink, and many people and communities depend on them for food and for income. They are a treasure that we need to guard closely. But while they seem vast, they’re not indestructible. They, and all the benefits that we get from them, are under threat from pollution, from the climate crisis, and also from overfishing. The Common Fisheries Policy is an attempt to safeguard that common precious resource that we have – fish stocks. It was last reformed in 2013, but it still hasn’t been fully implemented. In cases where it was implemented and where scientific advice was followed, where investments in marine protection were made, stock has recovered and this has benefited fishers. We have to continue on that path. I would say it is time to double the efforts in order to implement the common fisheries policy and to make sure that we safeguard the oceans for future generations. If we want new legislation, then we should look at legislation to double climate protection and to stop the pesticide pollution, for example, that goes into the ocean, because without fish there will be no fishers.",Greens/EFA,2024-01-18,3.

Billy Kelleher,"Mr President, overall, the EU was very supportive of Ireland during the Brexit negotiations and the Irish people appreciate what the EU did for us. However, on the issue of fisheries, Commissioner, Ireland lost out heavily. By 2025, Irish fishers will have been forced to accept a 15% cut in quotas – approximately 50 million per annum. This is a huge blow to our fishing industry, much of which is concentrated in a small number of towns and villages. We have seen jobs being lost in our fishing co-ops, and a large number of boats are being decommissioned. So in any upcoming review of the common fisheries policy, Ireland needs to see additional quota being allocated to us. It is only right and fair. Irish fishers are heavily limited in the amount of fish that they can catch in Irish waters. They see factory ships from other Member States – or worse, from third countries – entering rich Irish fishing waters and catching multiples of what they are allowed to catch. We need fairness in how quotas are allocated, and we need common sense when it comes to sharing or transferring quota between Member States. Spontane Wortmeldungen",Renew,2024-01-18,3.

Seán Kelly,"A Uachtaráin, at the recent Parliamentary Partnership Assembly meeting in the House of Commons we discussed fisheries, and we’ll be making recommendations as a result. One of the points that came across clearly was that Irish fishers, both in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, have lost out heavily as a result of Brexit, and we will make recommendations as to how that can be amended. Also, we looked at the annual quota, which makes no sense because if we, for instance, had to have an election every year, how could we function? It’s the same for fishers that need a multi-annual plan, the same as in the CAP, for at least five years. As well as that, we need to look at processing, carrying fish halfway around the world to process it, when it should be processed as close as possible to the landing port makes absolutely no sense, and that is what we should be doing in the future. And, of course, it should not help third countries, particularly countries like Norway and Iceland and others, when European fishers are discriminated against.",PPE,2024-01-18,3.

Mick Wallace,"Mr President, Commissioner, the common fisheries policy needs to be urgently amended to address the hugely disproportionate impact of Brexit on the Irish fishing industry. Ireland needs to see some genuine burden-sharing, whereby all coastal Member States share the pain of Brexit equally and proportionately. Ireland got an increase in its mackerel quota last month worth about EUR 3 million. But put it in context: the Irish mackerel sector is the most valuable sector for the Irish fleet, but it was hit hardest by the Brexit deal, with a 26% cut in Ireland’s quota share, which was worth over 28 million to Irish fishing. Commissioner, you spoke of equal treatment. Well, Irish fishermen and women need to get a fair share of fishing rights to the fish that spawn and breed in Irish waters. The CFP allows foreign boats to catch up to 85% of the fish in Irish waters, yet Irish ports get no reciprocal access to the waters of other Member States.

Virginijus Sinkevičius,"Mr President, honourable Members, it was a truly rich debate, and, of course, thank you for the variety of views that you have expressed. Let me react to some which I found most important, which were repeated by a few Members of Parliament. First of all, on the reform of common fisheries policy, the existing legislative framework provides the stability the fisheries sector needs. Several challenges have been identified to the successful implementation of the common fisheries policy, and initiatives announced in the fisheries and oceans package address these challenges. So the focus should be now, of course, on implementation and having, ensuring, stability to our fishers. As regards the MSY, where MSY has been implemented, stocks have increased. Catches and incomes are improving and impacts on the marine environment have decreased. Dear colleagues, these are real, tangible achievements which we have set out in our annual communications on the common fisheries policy. Returning back to landing obligation, which I already addressed in my introductory remarks, we need improved control and enforcement at all levels, as now also reflected in the recently revised EU Fisheries Control System, as well as the further use of more selective fishing techniques. The Commission will evaluate the landing obligation. Prior to that, throughout 2024, a study will be carried out to feed into the evaluation, so the Commission agrees that the objective to be reached should be to fish more selectively. Now social pillar, which has been mentioned a lot, and we had constant exchanges, which is absolutely critical for our fishers. The social pillar is crucial. It’s crucial for the fisheries and aquaculture sectors within the context of the common fisheries policy, but also for policymaking and implementation regarding the other blue sectors. So this overarching social objective is key to ensure generational renewal in fisheries. It is also essential for strong and resilient coastal communities. So we of course want to ensure that no one is left behind. And social pillar is a strong key part of the CFP. Very shortly, the Commission launched a new EU-wide participatory foresight project to forecast the role of fishers in the society called ‘Fishers of the Future’. Fishers are facing a multitude of new challenges – climate change, more and more competition for marine space, rising costs and the need to transition to greener energies, amongst others. And this project wants to look ahead and understand how fishers, including the small-scale operators, envisage their future. On small-scale fisheries, which was also mentioned, and Article 17 of the CFP, the Commission is working with Member States and the Scientific and Technical Economic Committee for Fisheries to assess the approach in Member States for allocating their fishing opportunities to ensure the transparency of criteria applied and their conformity with the CFP provisions, and encourages, of course, the use of criteria that can foster sustainable fishing practices and support small-scale and coastal fisheries. The last thing: level playing field. I know this is important, and I can reassure you that this is as equally important to the Commission. Commission is fully committed to further promote a level playing field for EU fishers, where they operate with the third countries’ operators. So the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing will also continue to be a key priority for us. Dear Members of the Parliament, dear colleagues, trust and engagement between all stakeholders from producers to policymakers is key to achieving our sustainability objectives and to strengthening our open strategic autonomy in the areas of fisheries. This is why we have called on Member States, fisheries stakeholders and the scientific community to join us in a Fisheries and Oceans Pact to reconfirm our joint commitment to fully implement the current policy and to contribute to necessary reflections and assessment of certain elements of the common fisheries policy. And this will then contribute to a discussion between fisheries managers and stakeholders on future-proofing the policy in terms of both social and environmental resilience. So today’s debate has been an important moment in this regard. Thank you for that.",-,2024-01-18,3.

Virginijus Sinkevičius,"Mr President, honourable Members, first of all let me thank the rapporteur, Mr Herbst, the shadow rapporteurs and, of course, the European Parliament, for this report and for their contributions to the discussions on the Marine Action Plan. It is important that these discussions are taking place publicly as they touch upon fundamental questions on how we see the future of our fisheries sector and of the natural resources on which this sector fully depends. Thanks to our common fisheries policy, we have already seen good results regarding the sustainable exploitation of commercial fisheries species. Fishing at a sustainable level clearly pays off economically, and this is a collective achievement. First of all, due to the hard efforts of our fisheries across Europe – of which, of course, we can all be proud and which should encourage us to continue our efforts so that we can achieve such positive developments in all situations. But fishing at sustainable levels will not be enough to keep fisheries economically viable. We must go beyond, and also look at how we can better preserve the ecosystems that allow fish stocks to thrive. Of course – let me be very clear about this – the degradation of the marine ecosystem is not provoked by fishing alone. This is why we are always looking at the ocean in a coherent and comprehensive manner, asking all sectors, all stakeholders, to step up and do their part. We know that our fishers cherish the sea. They are the guardians of the sea and we respect the role. The Marine Action Plan is a part of the Fisheries and Ocean Package, which, as you know, looks at all challenges affecting Europe’s fisheries today. The state of the marine ecosystem depends on the need to ensure a level playing field within and outside the European Union, the dependency on fossil fuels and generational renewal. It is all about increasing resilience, and restoring biodiversity is one of the ways to make the fisheries sector more resilient, so that our fishermen and women can continue providing high-quality seafood. This requires actions not only at EU level but also globally to enhance environmental standards at international level. In the Marine Action Plan, the Commission focuses on marine protected areas. When successfully implemented, marine protected areas offer large socio-economic benefits, especially for coastal communities and sectors like fisheries and tourism. Your report calls for scientific studies regarding the establishment of marine protected areas. When preparing this action plan, the Commission based itself on scientific data, which is why we proposed a targeted regional approach adapted to the specific needs, realities and challenges in each region. We do not want a one-size-fits-all approach. We want regionalisation to work, and it starts to work – not as effectively as we, of course, have hoped for, but we have continued to firmly believe that this is the right way to go. That’s why our Marine Action Plan calls on Member States to step up their efforts. Let me come back to the importance of science. Scientific studies show that increasing mesh sizes and minimum landing sizes enable the youngest fish to remain in the water, therefore increasing the chances for fish populations to reproduce. The action plan includes specific measures in that regard. We want to encourage and finance more work and studies to design the most suitable management options, which can lead to healthier fish populations that will bring higher yields per fishing trip and allow reducing fuel consumption. Again, the action plans include specific measures in that regard. Concerning eel protection, we are on the same line and continue to count on your support. The Eel Regulation needs to be fully implemented to ensure an effective protection of this iconic species. Finally, let me also say a few words on bottom trawling, which we have discussed extensively over the last year and which is only one area we address in our action plan. We do not propose a blanket ban on bottom fishing or any other technique, but we remain convinced that we need to move to less-damaging fishing techniques where possible and encourage massive innovation in this regard, funded for our fishers. Some of those techniques, they are already available and they are ready to be deployed more widely. Honourable Members, I would like to thank you once again for the open and frank discussions we have had over the last year. A lot of follow-ups remain to be done, but I am convinced that with a constructive approach and close cooperation among all institutions and stakeholders, we will manage to make progress. The biggest winners of that are going to be our fishers and coastal communities across Europe. Thank you for your attention.",-,2024-01-18,4.

Colm Markey,"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the common fisheries policy aims to support fishing communities, sustain fishing stocks, protect the environment and ensure fair distribution of opportunities across the EU. The common fisheries policy is fair for some, but not for all: 85% of the fish that’s taken out of Irish waters is taken by countries other than Ireland, with Ireland getting 15%. When it comes to reciprocal arrangements with third countries, they are worth about 60 million to third countries, but Ireland gets approximately 1 million in return. When it comes to processing those fish, many of the European fish go to Iceland and the Faroe Islands to be processed there, losing the opportunities of the multiplier effect in the local economy in Ireland. And finally, this has all been compounded by Brexit: 40% of the value of fish transfers to the UK came from Ireland; 15% of Irish quota was lost to the UK. The common fisheries policy in many ways serves unsustainable fishing by Norway, Iceland and the Faroe Islands at the expense of countries like Ireland. It’s a common fisheries policy for countries outside the EU and not for some countries within the EU, and we need to ensure that it’s much more sustainable, and we have to make sure that the opportunities that are there are for European fishermen in particular.",PPE,2024-01-18,3.

So, at the same time, when we’re talking about resilient fisheries, we have to ensure that there’s fairness in how we allocate the fruits of the sea, and the Irish quota has been drastically reduced. And the idea that we can explain to Irish fishers that it’s fair for third countries to send massive trawlers into Irish waters and fish, and we are offering Irish fishermen the only way out, and that is by decommissioning Irish boats, is shameful.

Stelios Kouloglou,"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, unfortunately, the rule of law is declining in Greece, and Greece is becoming a kind of banana republic. The perpetrators, the rapists of the rule of law and of democracy, are taking now revenge. I’ll give you an example. You know, Mr Demetriades is the nephew of the Prime Minister and was the centre of the spying scandal. You know what he’s doing now? First of all, he has public dinners with Mr Mitsotakis just to say that nothing happened. And then he is suing, he is bringing to justice independent media, the media that were reporting on the scandal of wiretapping. The last victim is an independent non-profit electronic newspaper, tvxs.gr, from which Mr Demetriades is asking more than half a million euros for 11 articles reporting on the scandal: 50 000 euros an article.

Didier Reynders,"Madam President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, on Sunday 17 December, Serbia held parliamentary and local elections in 65 municipalities, including Belgrade. Those elections were observed by a very substantial international mission from the OSCE/ODIHR, as well as Members of the European Parliament. Let me thank them for this important engagement. According to the statement of the OSCE/ODIHR, the elections, though technically well-administrated and offering voters a choice of political alternatives, were dominated by the decisive involvement of the President, which, together with the ruling party’s systemic advantages, created unjust conditions. In their statement of 19 December, High Representative/Vice-President Josep Borrell and Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Várhelyi took note of the report and concluded with concern that the electoral process requires tangible improvement and further reform. Let me underline that the rule of law and the proper functioning of Serbia’s democratic institutions remain at the core of Serbia’s EU accession process, as they are enshrined in our Treaties, which list Copenhagen criteria. The revised enlargement methodology clearly sets out that progress on the fundamentals determines the overall pace of negotiations. We expect that all credible reports of irregularities are followed up in a transparent manner by the competent national authorities. This also includes allegations related to the local elections in Belgrade and other municipalities. Following the adoption of the final OSCE/ODIHR report and recommendations for future elections, we expect Serbia to implement them quickly, ahead of future elections. We stand ready to support Serbia in implementing those recommendations. We have followed closely the protests in Serbia after the elections. Let me underline the importance of upholding the right of peaceful demonstration. At the same time, violence is not the solution and is unacceptable. Police action must be proportionate and respect fundamental rights regarding the rule of law. We call on the Serbian political leadership to ensure now a constructive, inclusive dialogue across the political spectrum. There is no space for disinformation narratives in a healthy democracy. Serbia remains a candidate country negotiating its accession to the European Union. We expect Serbia to demonstrate unequivocally its determination to advance the accession process by accelerating its work on the implementation of EU accession-related reforms across the board and to deliver real and tangible results. This includes, in particular, the area of rule of law and the normalisation of relations with Kosovo through the swift implementation of all EU-facilitated dialogue commitments, including the Agreement on the Path to Normalisation and its implementation annex. Let me also reiterate our strong expectation that Serbia will step up its efforts towards full alignment with EU common foreign and security policy positions and restrictive measures as a matter of utmost priority. We will be closely following how Serbia is delivering on these points and are ready to support Serbia in this endeavour.",-,2024-01-17,17.

But increasingly the LGBTIQ+ community, people of colour, migrants and other minorities encounter hate speech, especially online. This hate is fuelled by the far-right groups and amplified by social media algorithms. The purpose of this online hate is clear: they want to silence us and turn minorities into scapegoats. We know that online hate does not stay online: we see a stark rise in violence against the LGBTIQ+ community, with recent years being the most violent in ages. This is a danger both to the safety of individuals and to our democracies. Europe has to send a clear signal to society and to online platforms: there is no place for hate speech and hate crimes in the EU.

Maria Spyraki,"Madam President, I followed this debate very, very carefully and I would like to table two questions to colleague in ‘t Veld. The very first one is: do you really believe that we have to start cutting funding to Greece, like we did in Hungary? Do you believe that the Mitsotakis administration is behaving in the same manner like the Orbán administration? And please tell me yes or no, because it is important in this very moment, when Mitsotakis is initiating the same-sex marriage, despite the reaction in his own party, and all media are covering this situation. Second, do you believe that the situation in Greece is the same, like the situation in Slovakia? Is Mitsotakis Fico, who has already shut down the special prosecutor’s office? A lot of mistakes have been made and a lot of steps must be done, but the case in this place is that, in this very moment, this discussion, this debate is irrelevant. This discussion, this debate is misleading, and also the motion for resolution that we will discuss in February. This is because not only it is defaming my home country, it is undermining the credibility of this House, of this institution and it is being instrumentalised ahead of the election.

Vladimír Bilčík,"Madam President, Commissioner, dear colleagues. Serbia’s public space has been captured by tensions and personal accusations. Let me therefore recap some facts from drawn conclusions of the European Parliament’s observers from 18 December, which I also signed and fully supported. I quote ‘frequent snap elections cause people’s distrust of the state governance and are hindering the implementation of needed EU accession related reforms. The low level of political debate, the pressure on the voters, the emphasis on personal discreditation of opponents, the harsh rhetoric in political life in Serbia remain all very worrying. As observers, we also said on the day of the elections, key procedures for voting and counting for mostly followed. However, we have reported cases of lack of secrecy. We received several reports of mass registration in Belgrade, of voters from abroad and from other municipalities inside Serbia, specifically to enlarge the electorate. We call on the competent authorities to investigate properly and give follow up on all the problematic issues we have referred to’. End of quote. This was set jointly by all the EP observers on 18 December after the elections. Dear colleagues, I stood by these words in December, and I stand by them now. And I do so because I believe that Serbia deserves better. Serbia deserves a European future. People in Serbia deserve a political climate without constant political campaign. People in Serbia deserve true European reforms. People in Serbia deserve a clear choice between Russia and Europe, and a clear choice between confrontation and cooperation. People in Serbia deserve that politicians at last begin to deliver on these choices. I wish Serbia less focus on the tragic past and more energy towards a better future. I wish Serbia all the best in making brave and bright choices for the sake of people in Serbia, and for the sake of Europe. PRZEWODNICTWO: EWA KOPACZ Wiceprzewodnicząca",PPE,2024-01-17,17.

Klemen Grošelj,"Madam President, dear colleagues, once again the certified irregularities that occurred in these snap elections have proved that Serbia has a serious issue with meeting basic democratic standards and in conducting free and fair elections. We have been aware of these issues for years. However, what is new is the brutal openness with which these irregularities took place. In fact, it looked like the Serbian authorities did not even care. Why? Because they are still confident that nothing will happen. And unfortunately, they are right: the Commission and Council’s reaction has been, to put it mildly, very soft. This is the essence of the problem of our enlargement policy as a whole. The question is: will the EU insist on the implementation of our fundamental democratic values and principles, such as the principle that free and fair elections are the foundation of the EU? Or will we be politically pragmatic and, for the sake of quasi-geopolitical stability, sacrifice the democratic hopes and aspirations of the Serbian people? For me, the answer is simple, but I know that many in the EU have a huge dilemma. Supporting democracy is difficult, time consuming and demands a lot of work and dedication, while stable autocracy brings quick, short-term, pragmatic benefits. But if we look back to our own past, we will recall that when democratic standards and principles are in question, pragmatism does not bring the expected results. On the contrary, it usually brings more instability and in the end, even violence. If we truly care about the future of Serbia, of the Western Balkans and of the EU itself, we must support the democratic aspiration of the Serbian people and ensure that they can vote in free and fair elections.",Renew,2024-01-17,17.

Viola von Cramon-Taubadel,"Madam President, colleagues, I have seen many elections from Kazakhstan to Kosovo, Ukraine to Iraq. However, since I became an election observer 20 years ago, I have never witnessed something like this: mass migration of SNS voters to the city of Belgrade, busing hundreds of voters from Republika Srpska, pressuring voters, carousel voting, no access to international media for the opposition before the election day... The plan to publish election results tomorrow, but backdated to 3 January, will ensure that the opposition loses any right to appeal to the High Court. Let us be crystal clear, these elections are rigged. They are stolen. The United Opposition could have won in Belgrade if thousands were not brought in, reregistered or pressured to vote for SNS. Dear citizens of Serbia, the European Parliament stands with you. First, we demand an impartial international investigation together with the OSCE, as was the case in Serbia after the 1996 elections. The goal of every election observation mission is to respect the voters rule. If massive fraud takes place, the international community needs to protect voters rights. Second, with the inter-party dialogue, the EP has a long-term instrument for mediation between political party parties in Serbia. Why not use it now for this occasion? The EP is being recognised as a credible actor on both sides, Serbian authorities and the United Opposition. Let us make use of that.

Rule of law corrosion and political capture pervade all government sectors. Independent oversight bodies are being neutered. EU funding is conditional on serious efforts to prevent and detect corruption, which is evidently not the case in Greece. The Charter of Fundamental Rights is trampled upon systematically. Yes – another breach of the funding criteria. The statement of the Commissioner here leaves no room for doubt: Greece does not meet the conditions for EU funding. An unbiased reassessment is essential.

Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield,"Madam President, our democracy seems really fragile in Europe these days. While EU institutions look elsewhere, the situation in Greece is quickly deteriorating. We talk a lot about Hungary because things have gone so far there that it’s now a quasi-autocracy. Have we learned nothing? The Greek Government is fostering an increasingly restrictive legislative environment, which surveils and criminalises civil society, refugees and journalists. The same recipe used in Hungary and other Member State governments with autocratic tendencies. For the second year in a row, Greece came last among EU countries in the Reporters Without Borders 2023 index. There has been no justice for the murder of Greek reporter Giorgos Karaivaz, cases of harassment and intimidation against journalists in Greece are well documented, and there is a climate of fear in which journalists, independent bodies and civil society operate. The wiretapping of journalists, the attempted hacking of opposition politicians and the export of spyware remain unsolved. Refugees are tracked and monitored through the use of behavioural analysis algorithms and biometric surveillance. Individual human rights defenders are vilified in the media, subjected to smear campaigns and death threats.

Balázs Hidvéghi,"Madam President, Commissioner, these reports have been really nothing more than an instrument to push a left-wing ideology for years – no surprise about that this year either. But Ms Barley has crossed the line here, by proposing to silence political opponents – and no, Ms Barley, having a different opinion is no blackmail. No, no, no – it is having a different opinion. You just have to live with that in a democracy. But it seems there is a virus in the Western world. Political opponents are being banned, threatened by secret service surveillance, like the AfD in your country, or prosecuted under fake charges. The other elephant in the room, as it were, is the lack of mention of the lawlessness in Poland. Donald Tusk has started a political campaign of revenge, and he has broken the law, and he’s broken the Constitution. And there’s nothing about that here. Now, no matter what you think about him or his predecessor, it is not a question of political sympathy. These actions objectively cannot happen in a democratic state, and that should be in this report. It is not there. If you say the rule of law is so important, why is it not there?

Cyrus Engerer,"Madam President, wow! I just heard the EPP in a very different tone when it comes to the rule of law, simply because there is a government in Greece that is led by an EPP government. Meanwhile, did the new Presidency lose itself in the corridors for the third debate in a row? It is not even here to discuss a very important topic for us here in Parliament. But finally, we are discussing the situation of the rule of law in Greece after being blocked by the EPP so many times in this very chamber. But let me be blunt: why is the EPP so eager to defend the rule of law only where the EPP is not in power? And yes, I specifically speak of the EPP family here, as I am the first one to recognise that rule of law issues in countries where there is also a Socialists and Democrats majority, like in my country. In my own country we had never a problem to discuss this, but Maltese authorities always had an open dialogue with this Chamber and took on board many recommendations to implement as many European standards as possible. But what is the history with Greece? So firstly, we have a systematic breach of the rule of law. We have spying by government institutions on activists, politicians and journalists, tapping their mobile phones. We have had the murder of a journalist, Giorgos Karaivaz, and we have an attack on the fundamental rights of asylum seekers, and yet this is the first time that we are discussing the rule of law in Greece. We saw that even this chamber tried to stop last March a mission regarding the rule of law in Greece by the by the LIBE Committee, where President Metsola and the EPP even tried to annul it. Then the next day, the EPP Greek Government receives an EPP delegation from this Parliament: different hypocritical ways of acting when it comes to these topics.

Jeroen Lenaers,"Madam President, true democracy cannot exist without strong, diverse and, above all, free media. It requires scrutiny, and media play a key role in those checks and balances. We must always stand side by side with those performing that essential function. And we must do this in a fact-based way. It’s far too important to be politicised. Also, in this House, we must have the courage to be critical towards our friends, but also treat our political opponents in a fair way. And I hope we can do this in this debate today as well. Not everything can always be portrayed as either black or white. I speak here on behalf of the EPP Group, and it’s no secret that the government of Greece belongs to my political family. Yet you won’t hear me say today that everything in Greece is perfect. Like in many Member States, there is always room for improvement. Like everyone here and in Greece, I was shocked about the 2021 murder of journalist Giorgos Karaivaz. We welcome the two arrests in April last year, and I hope that we can soon see justice truly and fully done. More is also needed to guarantee the working conditions and physical safety of journalists. The Commission recognises the progress made and the taskforce is welcomed as an essential step by all stakeholders. So now is also the time to further build on these initiatives and equip this taskforce with the necessary means and make sure it works, as the Commissioner said, with concrete and targeted plans, in particular with regards to SLAPPS and the safety of journalists. On spyware, tomorrow we will vote on the Fundamental Rights Report, where we call again on Greece, Spain, Poland, Hungary and Cyprus to follow up on the recommendations of the PEGA Committee. And I think it’s important to also reiterate that call here today. Concluding, we see work ahead, but we also recognise the steps taken by the Greek Government. The Rule of Law Report highlights a number of key positive points, such as the new law on transparency of media ownership, the new Ethics Committee and the fact that a controversial provision of the Criminal Code was amended.

Didier Reynders,"Madame la Présidente, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, comme vous le savez, la Commission suit de près les développements liés à l'État de droit ainsi qu'au pluralisme et à la liberté des médias dans son rapport annuel sur l'État de droit. Sa quatrième édition a été adoptée en juillet de l'année dernière. Aussi, permettez-moi de vous en présenter les principales conclusions et recommandations relatives à la Grèce. En ce qui concerne le système judiciaire, la Grèce a adopté un certain nombre de mesures visant à améliorer son efficacité et sa qualité, mais plusieurs défis subsistent. Nous prenons note d'un certain nombre d'initiatives législatives récentes visant à réduire la durée des procédures. À ce jour, aucune mesure n'a été prise en ce qui concerne la participation du pouvoir judiciaire dans la procédure de nomination des plus hautes fonctions judiciaires, à savoir des juges aux fonctions de président et de vice-président du Conseil d'État, de la Cour suprême et de la Cour des comptes. En ce qui concerne la lutte contre la corruption, l'entrée en vigueur d'une législation sur les déclarations de patrimoine constitue un progrès considérable. Toutefois, le progrès accompli en matière de poursuites et de jugements dans les affaires de corruption a été limité. Quant au processus législatif, le rapport fait référence aux efforts déployés pour améliorer sa qualité. Dans la pratique, toutefois, des défis subsistent dans ce domaine également, notamment en ce qui concerne la consultation des parties prenantes. Et la question de la surveillance au moyen d'écoutes téléphoniques et de logiciels espions a fait l'objet d'enquêtes de la part d'autorités judiciaires et d'autorités indépendantes. Concernant le cadre réglementaire en matière d'enregistrement des organisations de la société civile, en particulier en ce qui concerne les organisations actives dans les domaines de la migration et de l'inclusion sociale, des inquiétudes persistent. La Commission considère que des mesures concrètes sont nécessaires pour évaluer le système actuel et déterminer s'il convient de le modifier, y compris en engageant un dialogue structuré avec la société civile. Let me now focus on media freedom. Greece adopted legislation aiming to enhance transparency of media ownership. The law set up a registry for print media, as well as a registry for electronic press, and reserves eligibility for state advertising to registered companies. Safeguards are in place to ensure the independence of public service media, but the fact that board members of the Radio and Television Corporation are appointed by the Minister responsible for media continues to raise concerns with regard to their effective independence and to potential political influence. The report also referred to the new procedure to hire staff members of the National Council for Radio and Television, the independent audiovisual media regulator, and persistent challenges regarding its understaffing. The report also depicts the situation of threats and attacks against journalists as incidents, including the use of spyware against journalists and abusive lawsuits. The creation in 2022 of a task force for the protection and empowerment of journalists is an important step. Nevertheless, more concrete steps are needed to improve the working environment of journalists, including as regards abusive lawsuits against journalists and their safety. The Commission addressed a recommendation to Greece in this regard. In this respect, the Commission also notes that the Council of Europe’s Safety of Journalists Platform identified at the end of 2023 two cases of impunity for murder, nine active alerts and two others without reply in Greece. The Commission follows closely developments regarding the rule of law in Greece, and will take them in due account for the 2024 edition of its Rule of Law Report. At the same time, the Commission proposed a series of initiatives to strengthen the protection of journalists and the media in the European Union. These initiatives will help improve the situation in Greece and in the whole European Union. They include a recommendation on the safety of journalists, a package of a directive and a recommendation dealing with abusive litigation against journalists and rights defenders, as well as a regulation on the Media Freedom Act. The Commission welcomes the recent political agreements on the two laws and thanks the European Parliament for its strong support. Regarding the use of spyware, the Commission has always condemned any attempt to illegally access to the data of citizens, including, of course, journalists. We addressed this issue in depth during the December plenary session, following the recommendations of the PEGA Committee. As I underlined at that time, the Commission is preparing a non-legislative initiative clarifying the boundaries between national security and EU law, in particular the data protection and privacy acquis. In addition, as part of the recent Defence of Democracy package, the Commission adopted a recommendation on inclusive and resilient electoral processes, addressing also the targeting of political actors and journalists by surveillance and spyware tools. The recommendation also recalls that national security should be interpreted in compliance with the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, to preserve the effective application of Union law. I thank you for your attention, and of course, I am now looking forward to listen to your intervention, remarks and proposals. VORSITZ: KATARINA BARLEY Vizepräsidentin",-,2024-01-17,16.

You could have put it in the amendments. You didn’t. Alright, there were some speakers from the right side of the Chamber who wanted this and that included in the report, saying whatever is not in. Well, you could have tried to get it in. The shadow rapporteur from the ID was not present one single time and also from the ECR, I think once. So I mean, you can’t stand here and say this and that and that is missing if you don’t work on it. And if they had been there, they might have heard me saying, which caused some criticism from the left side of the Chamber, that I only included in this report concrete mentioning of countries if we have an objective basis for it. Because I did not want this report to become a party-political thing. So we only have in this report mentioning of countries if we have a judgment of the European Court of Justice, something of the European Court of Human Rights or the Venice Commission or something comparable to that. So we really made an effort in this to make it as objective as it can be. But if you don’t contribute, then please don’t stand here and say what is missing.",S&D,2024-01-17,15.

Mick Wallace,"Madam President, this report starts by claiming the EU is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy and equality, the rule of law and human rights, and that these values should be shared and upheld and actively promoted by the EU and the Member States in their internal and external actions. And then you think of the ethnic cleansing in Gaza. The murder of 10 000 children in Gaza by the genocidal Israeli regime in just 100 days. The EU Council has not even called for a ceasefire. The Germans are not only defending the Israelis from the charge of genocide at the International Court of Justice, they have boosted our arms sales to Israel tenfold.

Costas Mavrides,"Madam President, the EU is above all, a union of justice with an independent and impartial judiciary, so that the European law is effectively applied not just with the legal harmonisation of a Member State. Compliance with effective implementation of the European law is applied through necessary domestic mechanisms. Two examples: the use of abusive and unfair terms and practices, especially by the banking sector in consumer contracts, and the lack of an effective implementation of the European directives, has been stated several times in reports of the European Parliament. This lack had a catastrophic effect on consumers, particularly the Cypriot citizens, but there is still no progress on the issue. Second, the complexity of the European laws and the case law regarding labour, considering also the high costs and the small size of certain labour markets, work disproportionately against the weak party – that is, the employee – than the employer. For this, the employee avoids the judicial process. Finally, in both instances, Mr Commissioner, justice is not served, and the Commission has a duty to ensure the effective implementation of the EU law. Catch-the-eye procedure",S&D,2024-01-17,15.

Tatjana Ždanoka,"Madam President, I fully agree with the rapporteur that I am citing that, in recent years there was some decline of the respect of fundamental rights across the European Union, and that the consensus on the common European values is at risk of crumbling. However, the report itself, to my regret, does not contribute to improve the situation, although it should have. It uses selectivity and double standards, which in my opinion is the main reason of that percent decline. I’ll mention just one example. The report speaks about following persistent forms of hatred and discrimination: anti-Semitism, anti-gypsyism, Islamophobia and racism. But how long will it take to recognise the embeddedness in the EU of such a phenomena as ‘Russophobia’ as well as less voluminous but gaining ground form of hatred like ‘Hungarian-phobia’? One of the main chapters of the report is devoted to the rule of law. But, Commissioner, your methodology when preparing this report needs to be changed.

Jana Toom,"Madam President, Commissioner, dear colleagues, with the consent of Mr Aguilar, I will be very slow. First, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadows for the good cooperation on this report. Fundamental rights are the foundation of the EU. It is good that we do this exercise every year evaluating the situation on fundamental rights in Europe. I believe that this report paints a realistic picture, raising concerns on press freedom and media pluralism, rule of law and justice, hate speech and violence, including gender-based violence, but also the increase of poverty, inequalities and social exclusion in the EU. The report calls on the Commission to act and to intervene where fundamental rights are being breached. But it also calls on the Member States to be proactive. This means that national parliaments, national and local administrations and specifically law enforcement have a duty to promote and protect our fundamental rights. Without proper implementation, our yearly exercise will have no impact. Therefore, I call on this House to support this call and to put pressure on other governments.",Renew,2024-01-17,15.

Didier Reynders,"Madame la Présidente, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, je voudrais remercier le Parlement, et en particulier la rapporteure Katarina Barley, pour ce rapport sur la situation des droits fondamentaux dans l'Union européenne. Le rapport donne un aperçu exhaustif de la situation des droits fondamentaux dans l'Union. Permettez-moi de profiter de cette occasion pour souligner en particulier certains éléments. Firstly, on the rule of law and access to justice, a central element of our action in this area is the annual Rule of Law Report, where the Commission monitors the state of the rule of law across the European Union, and which covers many of the issues highlighted also in your report. The Rule of Law Report has become a key driver for reforms. As you know, since 2022, the report includes country-specific recommendations addressed to each Member State. The 2023 report assesses, for the first time, the follow up to these recommendations. This year the Commission will also open the rule of law reports to certain accession countries, those that are the most advanced. These are important steps in the evolution of our rule of law policy, and I look forward to continuing the fruitful cooperation with the Parliament in this regard. The Commission is also determined to use all available instruments to ensure that the founding values are respected, including as regards the use of the Union budget. We do this in particular through infringement procedures, the conditionality regulation and the horizontal enabling condition on the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Furthermore, the Commission has dedicated its latest Annual Report on the Application of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights to effective legal protection and access to justice. We adopted this report last December. In this Charter report, we underline the need for the European Union and its Member States to continue providing effective legal protection in all fields of EU law. Secondly, a few words on the rise of hate speech again and hate crimes in all its forms. The Commission is determined to address the increase in hate speech and hate crime by ensuring the effective application of the EU rules in this field, especially the 2008 Framework Decision on Combating Racism and Xenophobia. We have also proposed to include hate speech and hate crimes in the list of serious cross-border EU crimes covered by Article 83 of the Treaty. As I underlined in the previous debate, it is time for rapid adoption of a Council decision on the matter, where unanimity is required. The recent joint communication ‘No place for hate’ also focuses on the need to respond to the threat of hate speech online. In this context, I want to mention the Code of Conduct in place since 2016, which aims to make platforms accountable for curbing hate speech. Such a code of conduct will remain an important tool under the Digital Services Act. We are therefore quickly advancing towards an agreement on a revised Code of Conduct, which will help anticipate rising threats before they go viral. On a related note, the political agreement reached on the AI Act in December will help ensure that risky AI systems are designed and used in compliance with fundamental rights, and that breaches of fundamental rights can be addressed by national authorities. Thirdly, regarding the freedom of assembly, association and of expression, the Commission shares the concerns about these rights being sometimes disproportionately restricted, including for civil society organisations and rights defenders. These fundamental rights form the very base for a free, democratic and pluralistic society. We therefore call on the Member States to ensure respect of these rights. The Commission monitors the situation of civil society organisations and rights defenders and reports about it. We are needed. We also issue recommendations to the Member States on undue restrictions of the civic space in the Rule of Law Report. In 2023 we also followed up on the 2022 Charter Report by organising a series of seminars on the thriving civic space. This process brought together stakeholders to reflect on how to better empower and support the civil society in the European Union. The Defence of Democracy package, adopted in December, also includes a recommendation to promote the participation of citizens and civil society organisations in policymaking. Finally, your report rightly underlines the need to fight non-discrimination and achieve equal treatment everywhere in the European Union. This is also the spirit that has guided the Commission’s actions to achieve a Union of equality through several dedicated strategies. In this context, let me highlight, for example, the importance that the proposed Horizontal Equal Treatment Directive would have in substantially reinforcing fundamental rights. We call on all Member States to support this proposal. I thank you for your attention, but of course I will listen carefully to your remarks and again, your proposals to improve the civic space and to reinforce the capacity to protect fundamental rights in the European Union.",-,2024-01-17,15.

Mick Wallace,"Madam President, the Minister for Justice in Ireland published a hate crime bill in 2022. If this was already law, the Irish Prime Minister, our Taoiseach, could well be facing a charge of grossly trivialising or denying genocide. In relation to South Africa’s case against Israel, the Irish leader said genocide is defined as the deliberate attempt to destroy an entire nation or entire race, or to do so in large part. At no point does the Genocide Convention use the phrase ‘in large part’. The Convention says ‘in whole or in part’ – ‘in large part’ suggests it is necessary to intend to destroy a sizeable majority of a group for the threshold of genocide to be reached. The Taoiseach also asked if the Hamas attack on 7 October was not also a genocide. He questioned the indisputable fact that Israel is committing genocide, while offering as an alternative an utterly bizarre example for which there is no case before any international court. The Irish leader has undermined the scope of the Genocide Convention and trivialised Israeli genocide. He does not speak for the people of Ireland.

Cyrus Engerer,"Madam President, ‘poofter’, ‘dyke’, ‘faggot’, ‘monster’: it all starts with one word, but it sadly ends with a knife, a fist, and in certain cases, a gun. This report should be a wake-up call for ministers to finally make hate speech and hate crime an EU crime. Ministers were very quick some months ago to add some other crimes in this list, but why not these? You see, the Commission is ready, Parliament is ready, civil society is ready, our citizens are ready, but the Council is the only missing one, always missing when there is a need to deliver protection of basic human rights. And even in this debate, where is the Council? The Presidency is not here, and not even one representative of one Member State is in this chamber on this very important topic, which they have blocked for a number of months and years now. Can ministers continue to turn a blind eye on the rise of hate speech all around Europe, targeting in particular women, the LGBTIQ community, refugees, migrants and opposing one community against another?

Andor Deli,"Madam President, Commissioner, it is very unfortunate that here in the European Parliament, the same recipe is being used against Serbia that has been used against Hungary since 2010, where the leftist liberal opposition tries to turn domestic political failures into success not through democratic elections, but with external help. But just as this tactic failed, in case of Hungary, it won’t work in the case of Serbia either. But there is a difference. Hungary is already a Member State, while Serbia has not yet joined the EU. But as we can see, the discrediting campaigns have already begun here in the European Parliament. In recent years, the image and credibility of the EU has greatly decreased in all countries of the Western Balkans, not just because of the hesitancy or rigidity of the Union, but also because of these overly critical, biased opinions.

Barry Andrews,"Madam President, Commissioner and colleagues, I want to commend the report of the rapporteur. I wasn't a shadow, but I was very struck by your comments earlier, and the way in which chaos can lead to populism, destitution can lead to populism. I think, if anything, the very thoughtful recommendations contained in this report should really make the Commission sit up straight, and I very much hope that it takes the findings of this report very seriously.  The cost of living crisis that is currently occurring is not one of equal opportunity. A recent survey in Ireland found that the cost of living crisis is having a disproportionate effect on women, who account for 6 in 10 of those with the lowest quality of life. The same survey found that 46% of women in Ireland are less happy with their financial situation, compared to 54% of men. So why is there a gender aspect to the rising cost of living? Women are highly represented in precarious jobs. They have lower incomes and wealth due to the gender pay, pension and participation gaps, and are still bearing a disproportionate burden of unpaid work. The cost of living crisis has a female face, as the rapporteur has said, and the European Union needs to deliver on its promise to leave no one behind.",Renew,2024-01-17,19.

But also the hope of acceding to the European Union one day sets in train reforms that may not otherwise happen without that. I would hope that the hope of being a member of the European Union one day – when they see the benefits which many of their neighbours, including Franc’s Slovenia, have, having joined – will encourage them to bring an inclusive society where the rule of law is observed, respect for minorities, etc. That hope then, and those reforms, will become a reality when they join the European Union one day.

It is nothing but a celebratory exercise which inflates the benefits without any recognition of the flaws of the agreement. It presents inflated numbers about the increase in trade in goods and trade in services, and on the number of jobs created. The report does not mention the shortcomings of the investment court protection model included in CETA. Our existing court system is well able to deal with business concerns. It also states that CETA fosters climate action, in complete disregard of the negative effects of the investment protection provisions on climate policy. And finally, it’s a lie: the report claims that the review of the trade and sustainable development (TSD) chapter can only happen after full ratification. Well, legal external analysis has indicated that the review of the TSD can be done before ratification.

Nicolas Schmit,"Madam President, freedom of expression is one of the fundamental values of the European Union. It is indispensable for individual dignity and fulfilment, but also essential for the enjoyment of a wide range of other human rights be they civil, political, economic, social or cultural. This is why the EU pays particular attention to the situation of independent media, supporting media pluralism and freedom of expression across the world. This applies also to our relations with Tajikistan. The EU regrets to see that the media environment in Tajikistan remains constrained by an obstructive regulatory environment, political interference and lack of diversity. The EU shares the concerns of the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media, Ms Ribeiro, expressed during her visit to Tajikistan on 22 October 22nd, about the high number of imprisoned journalists, as well as the persisting obstacles to media freedom. The EU also shares her concerns about the physical and legal safety of journalists, media regulation, accreditation of media workers and access to information. The government of Tajikistan justifies its restrictive approach using security reasons to fight against terrorism and tackling Islamic radicalism. While the EU recognises the security concerns of Tajikistan, it does not find the measures proportionate. The EU actively supports independent media and the strengthening of journalists’ capacity through trainings addressed to both private media professionals and institutional press officers from ministries and the Tajik Parliament. The positive dynamic in EU Tajikistan relations allows for strong engagement with the authorities on human rights through regular political dialogues as well as cooperation activities. Notably, the EU discussed the situation of independent media and journalists at the 14th EU-Tajikistan Human Rights Dialogue, which took place in Dushanbe on 23 December. At that meeting, the EU called on Tajikistan to ensure the right to freedom of expression both online and offline, without fear of reprisals, in compliance with international law and standards.

However, pursuing this interest cannot be at the expense of deteriorating human rights. We cannot ignore the repressive actions of the Rahmon regime, an autocrat who has rewritten the constitution in order to rule until his death. In Rahmon’s Tajikistan, journalists are threatened, arrested and imprisoned for speaking the truth. Human rights defenders are persecuted and jailed for standing up to injustice.

Now, the media’s freedom is reported to be in its worst state since 1991. Seven journalists were sentenced to lengthy prison terms for their work in 2022 and 2023, while anti-terrorism legislation is being used to silence critical voices. What was a relatively diverse media environment now entails only a few remaining media outlets that still have to endure harassment and threats. The rest of journalists are leaving the country and young people are afraid to choose this occupation.   In our resolution, we urge the authorities to stop the persecution, release detainees, including human rights lawyers, and ensure safe working environment for media workers. Ensuring the independence of media and freedom of expression must be a condition for the negotiations of the new EU-Tajikistan Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.

Nicolas Schmit,"Madam President, the humanitarian situation in Sudan has gone from bad to catastrophic. The EU reiterates its strong condemnation of the continuous fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces and their respective affiliated militias. Since the eruption of the conflict, the EU has been working with international partners and neighbouring countries in order to end the conflict. The EU encourages both warring parties to resolve their disputes via dialogue in an inclusive way, and strongly commit to a full cessation of hostilities so as to build a space for a durable peace solution in Sudan. In this regard, the EU supports the efforts of the Intergovernmental Authority for Development to secure an unconditional ceasefire and a resolution of the conflict in Sudan through political dialogue. We deplore the fact that, over a month since the 41st Extraordinary Assembly in Djibouti, neither the Sudanese Armed Forces nor the Rapid Support Forces have honoured any of the commitments they made there, while the suffering of the Sudanese people continues unabated. We are deeply concerned about the dire humanitarian situation in the country. Hence, today’s debate is a timely opportunity to discuss the threat of famine caused also by the expansion of conflict and violence into the agricultural regions of Sudan. In addition to the largest internal displacement crisis in the world, with over 7 million people displaced within the country – including over 5 million displaced as a result of the conflict – the Sudanese population now faces a severe nutrition crisis, with the highest rate of child malnutrition in the world. The World Food Programme estimates that 17.7 million people will be in high levels of acute food insecurity, including close to 5 million in emergency. Under peaceful conditions, a significant number of Sudanese would be harvesting and cultivating winter wheat now, so they could provide for their households and families and support national food availability as a whole. For almost ten months of intensifying conflict and inter-communal violence, agricultural activity has been hindered, farmers cannot import, and face limited supplies at local markets, while pastoralists are unable to access grazing areas due to insecurity. Since the start of the war, the EU has stepped up its efforts to mitigate the humanitarian crisis in Sudan and the region with the additional funding of EUR 60 million. Overall, the US allocated over EUR 128 million in 2023 to its humanitarian response in Sudan. EU humanitarian aid provides communities with health and nutritional care, food assistance, water and sanitation, and shelter, and also contributes to the nutritional treatment and care of children under the age of five and pregnant or breastfeeding women across Sudan. We are also working together with partners to promote safe access to humanitarian aid and the protection of civilians. The EU and its Member States’ contributions represent a third of the total international response. However, this is far from enough. The situation in Sudan has become resource-demanding since the impact of the conflict is constantly increasing and the risk of famine is rising. Honourable Members, rest assured that we remain committed to the people of Sudan. This year, the EU plans to continue supporting the population trapped in the worst conflict-affected areas, and those living in displacement hotspots, with the necessary humanitarian assistance.",-,2024-01-17,21.2.

Already before the outbreak of the conflict, Sudan was facing a humanitarian crisis due to extreme weather shocks, social and political unrest and rising food prices that continued to drive poverty, hunger and displacement. Many thanks to the European Commission for mobilising EUR 126.4 million in humanitarian aid for the people of Sudan in 2023.   In view of the ongoing emergency situation, the EU and the Member States must increase emergency funding for the humanitarian aid and the refugee camps, and increase aid throughout West Darfur and neighbouring countries.

Nicolas Schmit,"Madam President, honourable Members, on behalf of Vice-President High Representative Borrell, this debate clearly reflects the European Parliament’s sustained and deep concerns about human rights violations in China. Just five weeks ago, this House issued a resolution on the forced assimilation of Tibetan children through an extensive network of boarding schools. Another one was approved in May 2022, focussed on forced organ harvesting practices in China. The EU’s persistent and grave concerns when it comes to the human rights situation in China – the list is long: political re-education camps, mass arbitrary detentions, widespread surveillance, tracking and control measures, systemic and severe restrictions on the exercise of fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of religion or belief, and the use of forced labour, torture, forced abortion and sterilisation, birth control and family separation policies. As we speak here today, human rights defenders, human rights lawyers, journalists, intellectuals, academics and persons belonging to ethnic and religious minorities continue to be exposed to harassment, intimidation and surveillance and subjected to exit bans, house arrest, torture and ill treatment, unlawful detention, sentencing and enforced disappearance, and sometimes to transnational repression. Human rights remain one of the most challenging issues in EU China relations. The EU continues to seize every opportunity, including multilaterally and at the highest political level, to raise its persistent concerns about the very serious human rights situation in China. The 24th EU-China summit, held in Beijing on 7 December 2023, was no exception. In addition to raising the EU’s systemic human rights concerns, the President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission also raised several individual cases directly with President Xi Jinping. Let me reaffirm what has been already stated during previous urgency debates in this Parliament. The EU will never compromise on human rights. We will not stop voicing our concerns in public whenever necessary, and we stand by civil society and human rights defenders. We will continue to urge China to abide by its obligations under national law, including its own constitution and international law, to respect, protect and fulfil human rights for all. On the broader relationship, the European Council conclusions on EU-China relations of June 2023 demonstrated unity among the EU and Member States regarding the validity of the EU’s multifaceted approach. China is certainly a partner, but China is also a competitor. But China is also, and particularly, a rival.

Miriam Lexmann,"Madam President, dear colleagues, I welcome Parliament's strong stance on the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners. Just this year alone, reports mention a variety of tortures the practitioners were forced to endure: wearing a straitjacket, being shocked with an electric baton; sprinkled with chilli peppers, having their feet burned, being force-fed with mustard oil or deprived of food and sleep. Several women were sexually assaulted and we shouldn't forget about the sickening act of forced organ harvesting. Dear colleagues, let me speak frankly. For more than seven decades, the CCP has terrorised people across mainland China and continues to commit gross crimes against humanity. Yet, as the EU, we have sanctioned four minor officials for human rights abuses in Xinjiang. I am sorry, but this is a weak and insufficient response to the wide scale of crimes being committed by this regime every day. It is time that the EU is more principled in its approach towards the CCP. It is the lack of principled policies that led us into this current security peril.

Michael Gahler,"Madam President, dear colleagues. As China is a one—party dictatorship, it is not a surprise that in order to stay in power, such structures need to repress multifold groups in their respective societies. When it comes to China, we have on many occasions discussed the fate of the Uyghurs, of Tibet and of the citizens of Hong Kong. Today we once again focus on the fate of those who practice Falun Gong. It’s a practice that doesn’t harm anyone, that is not a danger to the state, but apparently the Party considers it – or has been considering it since 1999 – a threat to their ideology. The case we are focusing on is Mr Ding Yuande, who has been arrested and was in December sentenced to more than three years’ imprisonment. The only charge is that he practises Falun Gong. We are of the opinion that all those, not only Falun Gong practitioners, but the other groupings that I have named who are persecuted and repressed, need to be released unconditionally and allowed to practice their faith or to practice their culture, as it is also enshrined in the Chinese Constitution. We demand that the Member States publicly condemn these practices and that we should apply the EU global human rights sanctions regime and also national human rights sanctions regimes against all the perpetrators, as well as entities that have contributed to the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners in China. We stress that EU measures should include visa refusal, freezing of assets, expulsion from EU territories and criminal prosecution, including on the basis of extraterritorial jurisdiction or the initiation of international criminal charges.

The right talents are the engine of job creation, the lifeblood of our economy, and the key to continuing our journey to building a Social Europe that leaves no one behind. Skilling is a weapon against brain drain, a tool enticing our best and brightest in different fields. Skilling is also all about resilience, ensuring that we are in the most robust position to face the next crisis. I recognised all this early on in my mandate, especially with my work on the Digital Decade programme. Digitalisation will unlock opportunity, but without more immediate emphasis on reskilling and upskilling, we will not be able to make the most out of our citizens’ potential.

Nicolas Schmit,"Madam President, honourable Members I think this was a very useful debate, and I’m very glad that the issue of skills, the necessity of skills, is really a first and major preoccupation also of your Parliament. Thanks to the support of the Parliament, we could launch the Year of Skills. What we have to do now is to continue, even if on 13 April the Year of Skills comes to an end but the skills issue will not come to an end. So I think this is the beginning, and this is also a way – and also debates like the one we have now – is to really encourage all stakeholders to invest in skills. it is about skilling – it is about good education, because that’s another issue – it is about upskilling, it is about giving people the opportunity to be reskilled if sometimes their job is changing or even disappearing. This is the real issue: we have to take away the fear from people when they get the impression that in some regions, in some sectors, jobs are changing or even disappearing. So this is the way to take away the fear. Some mentioned sectors where we have a skills shortage, especially care, and coming back to women – because these are sectors where a majority of women work – we all know why there is this skills shortage in care, because working conditions are not good, because pay is low. That’s why what we have to correct, it is about skilling, it is about developing skills, but it is also about making these essential jobs more attractive. The last point is about youth. We have to specially address the issue of youth who have left school early, without any skills, without any diploma. Well, we should not resign, and it is up to us to give them new opportunities the right way by right skilling possibilities and especially – and that’s an important issue in a period where digital is developing so fast – it is about soft skills. Unfortunately, many, many young people are lacking soft skills.

Nicolas Schmit,"Madam President, honourable Members, thank you for putting this important topic on our agenda.   We have already debated this issue of quality of jobs and especially also the skills shortages in a competitive social market economy this morning.   It’s true that skills shortages are not only undermining Europe’s competitiveness and resilience, they are also a risk for social cohesion. In a recent Eurobarometer survey, two out of three small and medium-sized companies said that labour shortages are holding back their business, preventing them from investing and creating more jobs. The economic cost is huge. It is estimated that about 2% of GDP is lost due to skills shortages.   When I say job creation, I mean creation of good jobs. Having the skills needed on the labour market will precisely allow for access to better jobs. The main answer is to train people and train them now. We need it for the digital and the green transition. We have even dedicated one EU headline target on skills, namely that 60% of adults train at least once every year. This is not new. Lifelong learning goes back to Jacques Delors, who already emphasised this need even before becoming Commission president, and in his famous Stockholm speech at the ETUC conference, he announced the right for permanent training that has materialised in principle number one of the European pillar of social rights. To mobilise and encourage actions at all levels, especially in Member States and at local level, the Parliament and the Council established the European Year of Skills. The 2 000 events organised across Europe so far show that there is a strong awareness of how important lifelong learning is.   Of course, we do not start from scratch. The 2020 European skills agenda has laid out a roadmap on how to boost skills policies and has led to several very concrete actions. We have the tools and funding available, with EUR 65 billion supporting training through the European Social Fund Plus and the Recovery and Resilience Facility. The 2022 Council recommendations on individual learning accounts and micro-credentials promote more adult skills development, which should be supported by good guidance to both workers and companies, especially small enterprises. The 2023 Council recommendation on digital skills underlines the need for better strategies to support the development of digital skills at all levels and for all groups. Also, skills partnerships are an effective approach. Those established under the pact for skills have already upskilled 2 million workers. They are bringing together all relevant stakeholders in each industrial ecosystem.   We should also recognise that sometimes, skills are available, but they are not just visible. People develop useful skills at the workplace through volunteering, live experience, sport, leisure. Validating these skills will help people to find jobs and companies to create and fill jobs. Recognising skills and giving them value is as important as developing skills.   Companies that need skills should better identify the skill they need. Those skills may very well be already available among their staff. Also, when recruiting new staff, it is important to identify what applicants can do – not only look at their degrees or certificates or the job title of any previous experience. Recruitment should also be based on skills first. This helps companies find people with the skills they need, also among groups who are less represented on the labour market, such as women, the low qualified inactive monetary groups, older workers, people with disability.   Skilled migrants can contribute to address labour shortages, such as through the skills and talent mobility package, but this must be part of a holistic approach.   The message of the European year of skills is clear: skills shortages can be addressed if we recognise that skills matter and we need to develop them throughout our lives. Skills indeed matter. They are an investment, not a cost. This is the basic message of the year, and I’m grateful for the continued support by your Parliament in the common endeavour.",-,2024-01-17,20.

The weight of paid and unpaid caring responsibilities, as well as work in low-paid essential services, was disproportionately carried by women.

Irish women often act as the shock absorbers of the cost of living crisis going without food, clothes or heating to protect and provide for their families. The childcare system in Ireland is on its knees, with families paying akin to a second mortgage each month. Meanwhile, workers in the childcare industry, predominantly women, are barely earning enough to make ends meet. Many qualified and very capable women are forced to make the difficult decision to remove themselves from the workforce, as they’re not earning enough to make paying extortionate childcare fees feasible.

Maria Walsh,"Madam President, Commissioner, gender has a cost, and this cost is referred to as ‘pink tax’, a form of discriminatory pricing based on gender-targeting products and services for women. On the surface, it might seem like a trivial concern, but closer examination reveals a system that perpetrates gender-based economic inequality. Items such as razors, deodorants and dry cleaning, when marketed towards women, more often come from a higher price tag compared to the male targeted counterparts. Period products, which are essential health products, fall victim to the pink tax, resulting in inflated prices solely because of their gender association. This discriminatory pricing exacerbates period poverty and leaves many unable to afford these necessary items. Breaking the bank for essential products seems wrong, don’t you think, In today’s 2024 era? Addressing the pink tax requires a collective effort. Transparency in pricing and challenging companies to re-evaluate their practices is crucial. No one should bear a price tag for their gender, and it is time to put an end to pink tax too.

Ciarán Cuffe,"Madam President, Commissioner Schmit, in Dublin and across Europe women are struggling to keep themselves and their families warm. Nearly 30% of the households in Ireland are living in energy poverty. Calls for help to the charity Saint Vincent de Paul have soared since the crisis began. Two thirds of those seeking help in Dublin are female. The faces of this crisis are women – saving to put money in the electricity meter, more likely to experience energy poverty and social exclusion, more likely to be working at home and living in cold and damp homes, more likely to lead single-parent households, which are particularly vulnerable. My colleague Alice Kuhnke’s report shines a light on these issues. Thank you to her. We can and must do more to help. A new law, the recast Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, will help ensure that those at risk of energy poverty will receive renovation funds. However, we must also provide an EU-funded renovation loan scheme to prioritise at risk families and we have no time to lose.",Greens/EFA,2024-01-17,19.

Nicolas Schmit,"Madam President, honourable Members, first I would like to start by thanking the FEMM Committee and also the rapporteur for this report, and also what she now developed. Indeed, this report comes at a time when geopolitical tensions and persistent inflation have led to increased costs of living and amplified the challenges faced by citizens to access basic goods such as food, housing and, particularly, energy. As highlighted by your report and your presentation, women are indeed disproportionately affected by these developments. Almost half of lone mothers are at risk of poverty or social exclusion. Women represent 85% of all one-parent families in the EU. This means also that their children are affected by the same risk of poverty and exclusion. And your report calls for taking this gender aspect into account while addressing the cost-of-living crisis and especially the energy crisis. And we have to and we must agree. Indeed, women and men experience energy poverty in different ways and are unequally affected by energy poverty due to the gendered indicators such as income differences, housing conditions, care for dependent family members, and age. The gender pay gap remains an unacceptable reality, with big differences across the EU. Women’s gross hourly earnings are on average 12.7% below those of men, and for women aged over 65, their pensions are on average 29% lower than those of men. These are the main structural causes you also mentioned of women’s higher risk of energy poverty, underlining the importance of the directive on pay transparency. Energy and transport poverty are indeed a particular concern for women, and especially for groups of vulnerable women, which I have already mentioned – single mothers or elderly women. In line with the European Pillar of Social Rights, particularly its principle 20 regarding access to essential services, as well as in line with the gender equality strategy, we are strongly committed to support equal access to energy. The obligation to report on energy poverty was unfortunately only partly addressed by Member States in their updated national energy and climate plans. Let me take this opportunity to call on the Member States to set a clear definition of energy poverty, carry out an assessment of the number of vulnerable households, taking into account gender aspects, and outline structural policies to address these issues when submitting their final updated plans in June 2024. Structural policies will be key to ensure that the exceptional action taken by Member States to deal with the recent energy price spikes – such as emergency income support, tax reductions and temporary price caps – can have lasting effects. In addition, the renovation wave should improve overall living standards for Europeans next to its goals of reducing emissions and create more green jobs in the construction sector. This also links to the challenge of women being under-represented in the sectors that are at the heart of the green transition. For example, only 10% employees in the construction sector are women, and whereas their participation in the renewable energy sector is higher than in the overall energy sector, it still only reaches 32%. Another important initiative in this regard is the directive on adequate minimum wages, that Member States are currently transposing. Given the over-representation of women in low-paid jobs, improving the adequacy of minimum wages will contribute to gender equality by closing the gender pay gap and pension gap, as well as by lifting women and their families out of poverty. Many women work part time not because they like it, not because they want it, but because there are not sufficient child or elderly care institutions. Furthermore, the Council recommendation on ensuring a fair transition towards climate neutrality outlines comprehensive policy packages with the aim of not leaving – as you mentioned – anyone behind. This recommendation aims to ensure equal access to education, training and lifelong learning, notably for women, promote women’s entrepreneurship and strengthen the social economy, and also adapt social protection systems. Finally, your report highlights that the clean energy transition is key to reducing energy poverty and that women can be powerful agents of change in this transition. We can only agree the energy transition absolutely has to rely on women’s active participation, and on the recognition of their role and contribution. In this context, I would also like to highlight the energy communities: these initiatives, which are often rooted in the social economy, provide an important entry point for citizens, and notably women, to engage locally and concretely with the clean energy transition and promote a socially fair transition in communities. And we all know that developing renewables should reduce overall energy prices and therefore also decrease energy poverty. To conclude, EU funding provides strong support to address the rising cost of living and the impact of the energy crisis, starting from the NextGenerationEU to more targeted instruments like the European Social Fund Plus. Our ambition is thus not only to leave no woman behind in the energy transition, but also to ensure that women are equipped to actively participate and shape the fair transition we are working for. And I just have to mention our objective to reduce poverty by 15 million, at least 15 million, among them at least 5 million children. And this is also the best way: reducing poverty to reduce energy poverty.",-,2024-01-17,19.

Alice Kuhnke,"Madam President, we know from history that poverty feeds populism and extremism. Poverty is probably one of the greatest threats to our democracy, gender equality and the green transition. The past years, with the crazy inflation and Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, we have seen energy poverty rising. Across the continent, millions of EU citizens are struggling to make ends meet and having to choose between heating or eating. We have a responsibility to act because it is the vulnerable that pay the price for our dependence on fossil fuels and the volatile energy market. The only long-term remedy against demand shocks and price volatility is that socially just transition to a green and more efficient energy system. Energy poverty is a recognised challenge at EU level, according to the European Commission. Energy poverty is a widespread problem across Europe. Between 50 and 125 million people are unable to afford proper indoor thermal comfort. We also know that poverty has a female face. Globally and in the EU, women are far more likely to experience or fall into energy poverty. And we also know that the situation is growing worse and gendered energy poverty is increasing. This Commission promised to leave no one behind in the green transition. This Commission also said it was committed to gender equality. But unfortunately, the Commission has delivered a Green Deal and energy policies that are completely gender blind. In short, these important policies lack gender impact assessments. They lack gender-disaggregated data, and they lack gender indicators. In practice, the result is that Europe is failing to secure a socially fair energy transition. Structural problems require structural solutions. Therefore, intersecting data and a gender responsive approach must be a pillar in EU policy making. The report presents several concrete measures to combat the rise of gendered poverty, and calls on the Commission to really walk the talk on gender equality. To conclude, a green transition that is socially fair and leaves no woman behind, is an absolute prerequisite for the success of the Green Deal and for a gender equal European Union.

This is one of the energy sources where local people can also play a big role in creating energy independence for Europe. However, limitations such as restricted access to data, regulatory, technical and financial barriers are currently hindering its full utilisation. The lack of harmonised and complete data, sufficient geothermal resource mapping, dedicated rules for geothermal projects – also combined with the shortage of skilled labour – have highlighted the need for political action. Nevertheless, it is also imperative to remember that any development in this domain should adhere to the highest environmental standards, take into account legitimate public concerns, and carefully consider the specific geological conditions of each Member State. But it is also a question of good planning beforehand. Future legislation in this area will play a key role in stimulating the development of the sector and unlocking its potential. The new report, voted tomorrow in Parliament, aims to find solutions to these challenges and asks the Commission to put forward a legislative proposal that can tap the untapped potential of geothermal energy. I thank very much all the colleagues that have worked on this report and urge the Commission to continue work on the basis of it.",Greens/EFA,2024-01-17,18.

Didier Reynders,"Madam President, honourable Members, let me thank Professor Krasnodębski and welcome the own-initiative report presented today, which underlines the need to accelerate the deployment of geothermal energy across the European Union. We need various sources of renewable energy to grow fast if we want to achieve the EU's ambitious new renewable energy target of at least 42.5 % by 2030, adopted last year under the revised Renewable Energy Directive. It means more than doubling the pace of deployment of renewables compared to the past decade. It requires exploiting the full potential of all technologies in all sectors. It also implies making our energy system fit for enabling this fast transformation and ensuring that energy remains affordable. Geothermal energy so far has had a limited role in the European Union energy mix, but it has potential to grow. Over the past year, we have put in place many tools to support it. The adoption for the first time of binding targets for renewable heating and cooling under the revised directive will be a key driver for the uptake of technologies such as geothermal heat pumps and for further driving down their cost. We have also been working to address the skills bottleneck, from the launch of a large-scale partnership on renewables skills to the introduction of new measures on training, certification and awareness in the Renewable Energy Directive. A second important angle is the role of district heating and cooling systems using geothermal energy. They can provide affordable energy to whole cities, blend in new energy sources and provide flexibility services, for example in combination with heat storage. The revised Energy Efficiency Directive and Renewable Energy Directive define a pathway to the decarbonisation of existing district heating systems and the development of new renewables-based ones. This is also about good energy planning. The new Energy Efficiency Directive introduces new local planning requirements for the 1 000 largest municipalities in the European Union, a strong incentive for geothermal projects where much of the complexity is at the planning and exploration phase. In parallel, the new Renewable Energy Directive will ensure that district heating systems are taken into account when planning electricity infrastructure. A third aspect is related to competitiveness: with the introduction in the Renewable Energy Directive of renewable energy benchmarks for the industry sector, we would increase interest for applications such as the ones highlighted in the report. As for the EU geothermal industry itself, the net zero industry act proposal should help support its future growth and competitiveness, together with the inclusion of lithium in the Critical Raw Materials Act. The challenge is now about implementation, how to make sure that these tools are used efficiently. As highlighted in your report, the exchange of best practices will be essential here, in particular on applicable regulations and permitting, and on improved data, but also on financing and de-risking, as some Member States have been putting in place promising new schemes. So I will listen to your exchange during the discussion, and I thank you for your attention.",-,2024-01-17,18.

Ramona Strugariu,"President Vučić has called the 17 December 2023 poll, ‘the cleanest and most honest’ in Serbia’s history. International observers from OSCE ODIHR, however, concluded otherwise in their initial report, saying that the national vote was held under ‘unjust conditions.’ Our own EP observation mission pointed out to serious irregularities – phantom voters, vote buying, one-sided media coverage, to name but a few. It is thus not surprising that citizens took to the streets, for over a month, in order to protest what they rightly perceive as stolen elections. Opposition leaders, including Marinika Tepić, of Romanian origin, have entered hunger strike, asking for the annulment of the results of elections for the Belgrade City Assembly. Full support for their free voices! It is not the first time when we see in Serbia manipulation during the elections. But the sheer scale of this manipulation should give us pause for thought, especially as it regards a candidate country.

It’s a shame that a horny Russian hasn’t raped you yet.’ So, colleagues, these are actual comments from my social media. And I’m quite sure that all of my female colleagues, no matter if they sit on the left side or the right side of this Parliament or in the centre, you are familiar with statements like this. I am not here to complain. I have to say that I am in a privileged position. I have chosen a career in the public eye. I have the resources to seek help and a platform to speak out. But I think about all the women who do not. Those who suffer in silence, those who endure hatred, violence and harassment, often in their home without support or a voice. And when certain Member States, such as Hungary, block progress on hate crime legislation, these are the women they are failing, because there is a war on women by these leaders. These are the leaders who claim that the fight against gender-based violence is liberal hysteria. They claim that the Istanbul Convention is against their values - as if violence could ever be a value! So I demand the Belgian Presidency to take action. They have to protect the women.

Maroš Šefčovič,"Monsieur le President, Madame la Ministre, I think we are gradually concluding what was indeed a very, very passionate debate this morning. Most interventions focused on two topics: Ukraine and Hungary. First and foremost, I would like to thank you and I very much appreciate the overwhelming support for Ukraine. Despite the raging war, Ukrainians did their utmost to prepare for accession negotiations. They expanded national minority rights, improved their judicial system and ensured checks and balances on power. Lobbying bill to kerb the power of oligarchs just passed the first reading, and all this is happening under heavy missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian cities. Therefore, I very much appreciate your calls for mobilising financial support for Ukraine and Ukrainians. We will do our utmost, and I’m sure that in close cooperation with the Belgian Presidency to find appropriate solution at the next European Council meeting on 1 February. I also heard very clearly the calls from many MEPs to focus also on other very important issues, be it the Green Deal, strategic autonomy, artificial intelligence, stronger social measures or intensifying our communications with farmers and foresters, the call for mobilising more financial resources to deal with natural disasters. All these calls and interventions just confirm how urgently we need review of multiannual financial framework. We are working very hard on this. I know that the Belgian Presidency is working very hard on this, and I think that support, which I heard from many of you – be it Mr Papandreou, Mr Štefanec, Ms Marques, Mr Fernandes, Mr Belka, Ms Hayer, Mr Moreno Sánchez – just proves that this is really the issue which is coming across all aisles and that there is overwhelming support of the European Parliament for urgent, speedy review of MFF and for mobilising adequate financial resources for the European project. Another very important and passionate issue debated this morning concerned rule of law, Hungary and its access to EU funds. And you know, and I believe that all of you agree with me, that this Commission put the rule of law among our top priorities. Rule of law is diligently scrutinised and rule of law reports are debated at every single General Affairs Council and I am sure that the Minister would concur with me that we spend a lot of time and the discussions are very, very detailed in that regard and concern every single Member State. We also used all the instruments available to us to protect both our values and the EU’s financial interests. And last May, Hungary passed a new law on justice reform which addressed a number of our recommendations from the 2022 report. And this strengthens that judicial independence and limits the possibility of political interference on judiciary. This was required for Hungary to meet the conditions for cohesion funds, and on this, Hungary has delivered. My colleagues, Commissioners responsible for the various aspects of this dossier, already briefed the European Parliament and, of course, are ready to provide further information and further clarifications any time to this House. But let’s not forget that EUR 20 billion is still frozen and blocked under the conditional mechanism. So we have to respect the rules we agreed to together and this is what we are doing. But I would like to reassure everyone in this House about our utmost vigilance if it comes to this very important matter.",-,2024-01-17,4.

Tineke Strik,"Mr President, Council, Commission, the experts were crystal clear in their assessment: Hungary does not meet the standard of judicial independence, but the Commission decision to unfreeze the cohesion funds was not based on facts in Budapest, it was based on politics in Brussels. The Commission decision to bow down to Orbán's looming vetoes cost the EU so much more than EUR 10 billion. It cost us our credibility. It changed the Commission's already shaky track record upholding the rule of law.   And that means that this performance will be taken into account by the Parliament by approving the new Commission, and it will mean that we will see you in court.

Katalin Cseh,"Mr President, dear colleagues, I am honestly unsure if the European Commission fully comprehends the extent of the damage it has done by giving in to Viktor Orbán’s blackmail. Because it invited not just Orbán but every single aspiring European autocrat to follow the same old extortionist tactics: destroy democracy, weaken the EU from the inside, wave around the veto card and, when the time comes, just be ready to accept huge sums of money and accept the humiliation of being sent out of the room to go to the bathroom or have a coffee. Congratulations! Amazing achievement! But you know, there is also an even more serious problem here. You, with this decision, opened the door wide for even further abuse. Just consider what happened right before the EU decided to unblock billions of euros to the Orbán Government and praise them for this great progress in rebuilding the rule of law, on the very same day that Hungary introduced the so-called sovereignty protection bill – a piece of legislation that is shockingly oppressive, even with the Orbán regime standard. This law threatens journalists and civil society organisations with jail time for participating in international funding programmes. Its intention is crystal clear: to crush dissent, to silence independent media and threaten opposition parties or anybody who would like to stand up against this regime. And I’m seriously asking this: does the Commission view this as progress? Do you think this deserves a reward? Because this is the signal that you just sent.

Sophia in 't Veld,"Mr President, colleagues, I’ve already made my remarks about the absence of President von der Leyen, which I consider to be unacceptable. But in her speech, she defiantly claimed that Orbán had delivered on the rule of law conditions. Now she knows that’s not true. She’s not fooling anybody, not even herself. But she did set a precedent, because Prime Minister Fico of Slovakia is already rubbing his hands, like many others, who are actually quite happy that Mr Orbán is making so much noise and attracting all the attention, so that they can continue their transgressions on the rule of law behind his back. The decision of the Commission is further undermining the rule of law, but also the democratic institutions of the European Union. The problem here is not one man or one country. The problem is that the European Commission no longer acts as the guardian of the Treaties, but as the lapdog of the Member States, and this House unfortunately indulges her. Ms von der Leyen broke the law by ignoring the conditionality rules. But even more seriously, she violated the Treaties, because the timing of the decision, on the eve of the summit, proves beyond any doubt that it was meant to serve the European Council. That, colleagues, is contrary to the requirement of independence of the European Commission. Now, this House will take the European Commission to court, and that’s fine.

Poor macroeconomic management weakens the EU in every aspect, including our reaction to the exigencies of geopolitical challenges, be it war in Ukraine, be it the energy crisis. We have achieved improvement so far over the currently functioning format based on the SGP. We have a more country-specific approach, which should strengthen country ownership. We have a longer term horizon, 4 to 7 years, more realism. We have simpler rules based on longer term expenditure. This provides for fiscal discipline being much less procyclical. What we don’t have is a permanent Community fiscal instrument. With some bitterness, let me say that we need yet another crisis to agree on this.

We have witnessed a downward spiral when it comes to media freedoms, human rights, LGBTQI rights, women’s rights, the independence of the judiciary.

It is a sad story for all of us, all of us, and most of all for the Hungarian citizens, of course. And we all have a responsibility to change this, a responsibility to support civil society, democratic forces, all the ones that work tirelessly to restore democracy in Hungary.

It is a disaster for all of us to have him and his government at the reins of our common work. So you have the power, but you also have the duty to act now to suspend the Hungarian Presidency.

I’m not an investigative authority, but we are also aware of all the funds that Viktor Orbán and his oligarchs have at their disposal. We can also see that not only in Hungary, but in the whole region, they are expanding and they are building out their illiberal system in the neighbouring state very, very effectively. A good guess is that a significant amount of those monies comes from the EU itself; other sources perhaps come from elsewhere.

Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield,"Mr President, European democracy may be dying. This is not an overdramatic sentence that I’m using to get your attention: it is exactly what is happening because of the resistible rise of one man – the Prime Minister of Hungary. Not only has he created a quasi-autocracy on the soil of the European Union, not only has he eroded civil liberties and now fundamental rights for his own people and set a frightening example, not only has he put a foot in the middle of the system and become the voice of the Kremlin around the table, but over the last few years he has been playing you: blackmailing every Member State more and more, and in a systematic way. The EU has made this politician stronger. The Commission gave him the money to capture power and install his oligarchy, and the Council empowered him by accepting to give him leverage and set the rules. At the end of your presidency, Belgians, you will be giving this man the keys of the House. This will pave the way for him to set the agenda, say whatever he wants about Russia and Ukraine and represent the EU in our name. It is inconceivable. But the leaders of Europe have decided to not do anything about it. It is time to take the game out of his hands. Belgian Presidency, you need to put back the recommendations on the table. You have already started working on this. You can find the needed qualified majority. How is it possible that today we are still not having enough Member States around the table who are courageous enough to vote on a simple recommendation? You need to prepare for the future, and that means Article 7.2. It is time to seriously think about withdrawing the voting rights of Viktor Orbán. But most of all, today, you urgently need to find a way to not give the presidency of the EU to a quasi-autocrat.

Malik Azmani,"Mr President, dear Vice-President Šefčovič – because Ms von der Leyen left the room – dear Minister Lahbib, dear colleagues, needless to remind you that democracy and the rule of law are under attack in different parts of the world. But what is even more terrifying today is that they are also under attack in Europe, in our own backyard. The fact that our guardians of the Treaties, who are supposed to protect the EU’s financial interests, are now giving in to blackmail is unbelievable. We, in Renew Europe, strongly condemn the actions of the Prime Minister of Hungary, who decided to block the decision on the funding of the Ukraine aid package. This is in full disrespect and violation of EU strategic interests. How long, dear colleagues, can our Union and its taxpayers be asked to tolerate this blackmail from within? When does this end? This issue needs to be treated as a matter of urgency for the health and wellbeing of our Union. The special European Council meeting on 1 February needs to agree on the targeted MFF revision, allowing us to respond to urgent challenges and citizens’ needs, while also fulfilling our political and financial commitments to Ukraine. Ukraine’s security is Europe’s security. Ukraine’s future is Europe’s future! Furthermore, the Article 7 procedure that this House voted on many years ago must be taken forward. The removal of Orbán’s voting rights should not be off the table. Lastly, the Rule of Law Conditionality mechanism must be upheld. Mr Šefčovič, on behalf of the Commission, we can no longer give in to Mr Orbán’s demands. The confidence of this House in the Commission depends on what happens next. You may claim that the European Commission had to unblock money in December legally. But transparency is the key here. With clarity on the consideration to free funds, we would not have to ask the Committee on Legal Affairs to prepare an action before the Court of Justice. We need answers! Can you imagine that the European elections are around the corner and we are having a debate on Viktor Orbán’s latest demands? This is deeply regrettable. Let us stand with Ukraine and mean it. Let us agree on a budget worthy of our challenges. Let us start to focus on the many achievements of this mandate and the way forward.

Elisabetta Gualmini,"Mr President, Council, the revision of the EU budget that the European Council is negotiating is absolutely good news. Europe is finally increasing the budget allocation to address energy costs, the war in Ukraine and the environmental disasters. But the bad news is that, as far as we know, today’s negotiations on the budget are still blocked and the culprit is the usual suspect, Viktor Orbán, and, it is worth repeating, the friend of the far right, the friend of Vladimir Putin, the despotic leader who holds Europe hostage at every historic juncture. So he is now obsessed with funds for post-war reconstruction in Ukraine. But with his veto, he is also blocking European investments in strategic sectors, blocking resources allocated to manage migration and, above all, blocking the increase of the European Solidarity Fund, for instance, which would have been crucial for the floods hitting Italy, Emilia-Romagna. Today, Giorgia Meloni will be in Forlì, I think, with Ursula von der Leyen. I hope that she is going to Italy and I hope that Giorgia Meloni strongly emphasises that her friend Orbán is withholding additional funds for the citizens of Emilia-Romagna. So, this Chamber is really wondering why, for years, we allow Orbán to put the brakes on a strong and solidary Europe. Europe is not an ATM.

Siegfried Mureşan,"Madam President, I say to Mr Hidvéghi, your narrative on an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine we have heard from the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. The choice is not between war and peace in Ukraine. The choice is between victory and surrender, and we will not surrender and we will support Ukraine for as much as is needed. This has always been the will of the European Parliament and of the European Union.   Now, with regard to the situation where we are, we have managed together, the European Parliament, Council and Commission, to achieve a lot at the end of last year, including the December European Council. The choice to start accession negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova is justified. It’s right for those countries, but it’s right for us as well, because those accession negotiations are the best tool that we have to modernise, to reform two neighbouring countries of the European Union.   There is, however, one leftover from the last European Council, and that is the revision of the multiannual financial framework and granting immediate support of EUR 50 billion to Ukraine. This is urgent and it is important. And this is why, while the message to the people of Europe is ‘Europe was delivering in the last months of the last year’, now the message to the European Council and to the Council of the European Union is ‘agree on the revision and agree on the 50 billion for Ukraine on 1 February’. Later will be too late: 1 February is needed in order for us here in the Parliament to be able to fulfil our role, to examine this proposal, to add the opinion of Parliament and to give a clear, transparent vote with a good majority before the European elections.   The message to the people of Hungary is that of course we want the people of Hungary to benefit from Europe, from European funds, from the Recovery and Resilience Facility as the people of any other European country do. Unfortunately, the actions of the Hungarian Government have prevented Europe’s will to support the people of Hungary. And this is why the message to the people of Hungary, and to anyone who might be attracted by the model of Viktor Orbán, by the confrontation with the European Union, is the following: unfortunately, Hungary has been losing in the last years and months. Viktor Orbán has been losing. He still has more than EUR 20 billion of EU funds blocked at European level. The President of the Commission has confirmed this. The solution in Europe is dialogue, is working together, is not a confrontation with Brussels. This is what we will deliver. VORSITZ: RAINER WIELAND Vizepräsident",PPE,2024-01-17,4.

Balázs Hidvéghi,"Madam President, Minister, President von der Leyen, there can be – and there are – different opinions on how to best help Ukraine. We continue to believe that our number one priority should continue to be to find a ceasefire and a peace deal as soon as possible. We also think that Member States should create a fund outside of the EU budget to help Ukraine, and that new funds should not be based on a new loan. Countries can contribute and Hungary stands ready to contribute to such a fund.   Now, one more thought on the EU budget. Every euro cent should be paid to Hungary without any further delay. Ideological blackmail is not acceptable. And by the way, if you’re looking for a real rule of law crisis, you should turn your eyes to see what’s happening in Poland these days.   Lastly, the proposition to suspend Hungary’s voting rights just because we happen to disagree on some political issues is an absolute new low, even for this Parliament. It is as shameful as it is absurd. You disagree with someone, and then you want to take away their right to speak and vote? That is a dictatorship.

Terry Reintke,"Madam President, dear colleagues, dear representatives of the Council and the Commission. Sometimes in politics, it is worthwhile to take a step back and to look at the bigger picture, and sometimes I ask myself how the European Union looks to others from the outside. We stood together in difficult times during the COVID-19 pandemic. When Russia brutally invaded Ukraine, we stood at the side of Ukraine and we stood united. We should actually right now be considered a strong and meaningful actor in the world, but unfortunately we are not. We are considered too disunited and, by many, also too weak. That is mostly due to one person, one man who we let do whatever he pleases to get what he wants, who we let blackmail and ridicule the rest of the European Union – Viktor Orbán. He attacks minorities, he dismantles press freedom, he dismantles the independence of the judiciary, he weakens Europe, and he disables Europe’s ability to act now vis-à-vis Ukraine. But I can tell you, China is closely watching, obviously, the US and the rest of the world. All for his friend Vladimir Putin and his own pockets. What do the other Member States do? They sit by and let it happen. Big names, important people, presidents, chancellors, prime ministers, they are all too hesitant to do something about it, including the Council President, who has not delivered on something that this Parliament has been asking for for many years now, and that is to move ahead with an Article 7 procedure. What else will you let happen – Hungary becoming even more of an autocracy? Europe becoming weaker and weaker for its own citizens because we are not delivering on the tasks that the citizens demand for the support of Ukraine? Seriously, colleagues, time is up. Ukrainians are losing their lives. Ukrainians are fighting for our freedom too, and we have Putin’s best servant sitting at the table in the European Council, blocking our support and our credibility at this crucial stage. This is a joke, and this is a very bad joke, especially when the Member States actually have the tools to stop this, and not with difficult legal constructions for the financial help of Ukraine – I’m not against it if it is the only way – or to have a proposal for an even dirtier compromise with Orbán. No, the way would be very simply by moving ahead with the Article 7 procedure, not only to defend the rule of law and democracy in Europe, but to make Europe strong in this crucial battle between democracy and autocracy.

Guy Verhofstadt,"Madam President, I ask of Ms von der Leyen, can I ask you a very simple question? That is, are you going to repeat the practice that happened during the previous European Council in December? You remember that? The blackmail by Viktor Orbán to use the veto. And then just before that European Council, the freezing of I think it was 11 billion, in exchange for the fact that he left the room. That was the deal: ‘11 billion and you leave the room’. So my question to you is, are you going to do that again? Because it could happen on 1 February. That is, that he again uses his veto, now for another thing, not for the accession negotiations, but for liberating the 50 billion of funds that are desperately needed for Ukraine.   And I have to tell you very openly, before you answer, that if your answer is a yes, then you will run, I think, into big troubles here in this Parliament, not only with me, not only with my group, but I think with the vast majority of this Parliament. I have to tell you, giving in to the blackmail of Orbán like it happened in December has to stop now. And also the compromises that have been put on the table to make a yearly portion of that money or to give a mid-term review on that money, or not a compromise, because it’s simply opening the door for more blackmailing, by Orbán in the coming years.   So, the appeal that I want to launch to you, hopefully, I think, in the name of the vast majority of this parliament is stay inside the treaties, and pick up your role that you have as the guardian of the treaties, because there are sufficient solutions to give this money to Ukraine inside the provisions of the treaty of today. You don’t need to, every time, give in to the blackmail of Orbán. You could propose a face-saving emergency clause or break, like we call, it at 27. That could be a solution. Or you could go into an enhanced cooperation, with 26, under the control of the European Parliament, because enhanced cooperation is controlled by the European Parliament. Or ultimately, you can indeed propose to the Council to take away the voting rights based on Article 7(2) of the Treaty, so that we can decide with unanimity on 26. That’s another proposal.    Anyway, I know I have a very bad reputation in this House, and maybe also with you, I don’t know. And I have also, from time to time, a bad character. I’m sometimes even replaced in my positions. But can I ask you one thing – to be a little bit of all that concerning Orbán?

Pedro Marques,"Madam President, Council, dear President von der Leyen, colleagues, I want to start by saying that whoever leads the Council on its special meeting on the 1st of February needs to show enough strength and leadership to overcome the blackmail of Orbán and deliver on the EU budget and the support to Ukraine. Europe is yet again at an existential moment. Europeans are looking at us. European leaders need to show that they can actually be respected by our citizens and the whole world. Who could tell that through this mandate, our geopolitical Europe would indeed be tested so much? Yes, we delivered in the vaccines altogether, but too many of them were sold to the developed world while the rest of the world was looking at us in agony. Yes, we delivered with resolve to the Ukrainians for these two years, including by opening the negotiations for accession just a month ago. But when the US are starting to falter, we are not yet filling the gap, even if it is our security, our values and our freedom that is being fought for on those fields. We are taking too long to create our own strategic autonomy in a world that is much more confrontational now. We are giving in to the blackmail of Orbán, and all the bullies in Europe are rejoicing with that. The Europeans are suffering and the populists, they are laughing at it because they will grow from anger and frustration, turning suffering and fear into hatred. And now, at this critical moment, we are faced with a proposal to eventually start cutting our policies that can help those that are suffering to pay for the interests of Next Generation EU. We cannot do more, like helping Ukrainians or all the correct priorities you identified, Madam President, with less, at the cost of other policies like cohesion policy. Europeans want fair transitions and better housing for all. They want to reinforce our social economic model, not to see it endangered by austerity policies imposed by the Council. We will fight as a parliament for social convergence and sustainable investment in the new fiscal rules. The populists, the neo-fascists, the anti-Europeans that now you worry about, Mr Weber, those are coming now out of every corner. They are raising their arms into the open air, fuelling from people’s frustrations. The Europeans are asking us, where is Brussels when we need it? This is a defining moment.

Ursula von der Leyen,"Madam President, dear Roberta, Madam Minister, honourable Members, a global year of election has just begun. It is the hour of democracy, also here in Europe, but the world around us keeps spinning. We have two bloody wars continuing to rage just outside our borders. The human suffering is immense and the shock waves are felt well beyond Ukraine and Gaza. After the energy and food crisis set off by Russia, global trade is now being disrupted by Houthi terror in the Red Sea. Our world is in an era of confrontation and conflict, of fragmentation and fear. And this moment calls for focus and responsibility inside our Union. Only together can we address the grave challenges we face. And that is the greatest lesson we have learned over those four years: when we stand united, Europe stands strong. We have seen it again at the end of last year. After almost 10 years of divisive debates, we have an agreement on the New Pact on Migration and Asylum, and I want to thank all of you in this Parliament who have never stopped seeking common ground. And, of course, I count on you and your final green light before the end of this mandate. (Applause) And the Pact is not the only critical step that our Union has taken in recent weeks. The hearts of millions of Ukrainians were filled with joy and hope when we announced the opening of accession negotiations. The people of Ukraine have fought hard to achieve this goal, not only on the battlefield, but also through the work of their democratic institutions. It is just in a matter of a few months that they have passed new laws to expand national minority rights, to improve the judicial system, to ensure checks and balances on power. And last week, the Rada approved in first reading the lobbying bill that will curb the power of oligarchs. These are significant achievements. Ukraine’s democratic institutions are delivering – not only on our recommendation but on the aspirations of their people. A whole nation is showing us just how much Europe means to them, and I am proud that our Union has answered Ukraine’s call. Now we must follow up on the political situation and the decision that we took at the European Council. In preparation for the accession talks, we are starting the screening process and putting together now the negotiation framework. And in the meantime, we will also start working on our reforms – our own reforms – to prepare for a Union of 30+ Member States. At the last European Council, we also agreed to launch accession negotiations with Moldova and with Bosnia and Herzegovina when the necessary criteria are met. We have granted candidate status to Georgia and we have confirmed our collective commitment to the future, where all six Western Balkan partners are part of our Union. How will a Union of 30+ countries work in practice? Only we inside the European Union can answer this question. This House has already put forward bold ideas for reform of our Treaties. Next month, the Commission will set out our ideas in a communication to the European Parliament and the Council ahead of the leaders’ discussion organised by the Belgian Presidency. Honourable Members, the last European Council has shown the political will to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes, but we must back this decision with adequate funding. We have proposed to guarantee stable and substantial financing to Ukraine over the next four years, to support the daily functioning of the state, to stabilise the economy, to bring it closer to our Union. All this requires an updated EU budget and, as you all know, the mid-term review is not only about Ukraine, it is about competitiveness, it is about migration, it is about our support for the Western Balkans, it is about solidarity when natural disasters hit, like flooding or wildfires. These are priorities that we collectively share. We need this mid-term review and I am confident that we will find a solution by 2027 that this is possible. The final topic I would like to address is Hungary and its access to EU funds. This is also about the fundamental values that bring us together. When we took office, we promised to safeguard the rule of law in our Union while being fair to all Member States. I have made this a priority for my Commission. This is why this Commission has created the annual Rule of Law Report. And we have used all the instruments available to us to protect both the values and the EU’s financial institutions. Our goal has always been to push for reforms in the Member States, that they can improve the life of every European. Last May, Hungary passed a new law on justice reform that addresses a number of our recommendations from the 2022 report. It is a law that strengthens judicial independence and limits the possibility of political interference in the judiciary. This was required for Hungary to meet the conditions for cohesion funds. This is what we requested and this is what Hungary delivered. Commissioners briefed Parliament beforehand and, of course, they stand ready to provide further information any time. At the same time, around EUR 20 billion remain frozen. They are suspended for reasons that include concerns on LGBTQI rights, academic freedom and asylum rights. Some are blocked under the conditionality mechanism, and they will remain blocked until Hungary fulfils all the necessary conditions. In the meantime, Hungary has also received pre-financing under REPower, like any other Member State. This pre-financing is not subject to any condition. These are the rules. We have all agreed to them and we will follow them. This is what makes the rule of law stand out from arbitrary power. (Applause)",-,2024-01-17,4.

Manfred Weber,"Madam President, Commission Presidency, I will start with a quote from a former Belgian Prime Minister and founding father of the EPP. Wilfried Martens once said: ‘There will be only an ambitious Europe or no Europe at all’. And at the beginning of this electoral year, we proved this. Ursula von der Leyen has demonstrated together with us in the last years that we are ambitious on climate policy, the Brexit agreement, COVID vaccines, RRF, Ukraine support and the migration policy. The EPP is not building castles in the air like some of the left are doing, and we are not having a wrecking ball in our hand like the radical right is doing. The EPP’s Europe is an ambitious Europe and we deliver. I want to thank for this. The European Council in December showed leadership: yes to Ukraine, yes to Ursula von der Leyen’s proposal on enlargement to start the negotiations, especially with Ukraine. This was an historic decision and gives certainty to the Ukrainian people. Yes, you can be part of our family. Yes, it’s worth to fight against Putin. Yes, Ukraine must win the war. But the European Council also failed when it was about the money – to create certainty on our long-term financing of the European Union. And yes, there is a question now with Viktor Orbán and Hungary on the table. For us, as the European Parliament, it was a huge success in this mandate to establish a binding rule of law mechanism. It was our common effort, our common success. For us, as the EPP, it was always important to have a fact-based assessment about rule of law in individual cases. And for us now, the important thing is that we need further clarification. As the EPP, we initiated a letter to ask in the BUDG Committee and also in the CONT Committee about the reasoning behind the decision of the Commission. And we are welcoming Commissioners Schmit, Reynders and Commissioner Hahn to inform us about this. That’s the next step in front of us. Hungary has for a long time here in this Parliament been seen as a difficult case. We have initiated an Article 7 case against Hungary. And if I may say so, it’s great to hear the Council telling us that the Commission decision must be assessed. But the most important thing – what I would love to see from the Council side – is to answer our request on Article 7, because that is on the table and until now the leaders had no courage, and obviously no time even, to discuss the Hungarian case on substance on the Council side. So please answer the demand from Parliament. The question now on the table for Ukraine is how to pay teachers, how to pay nurses, doctors and all of the soldiers? How to convince our American friends and the IMF to continue supporting Ukraine? Having this in mind, the end of January Council must deliver. We must be prepared for all options at the end of this month and we, as the EPP, also insist on the other elements on the MFF: don’t forget about migration, for example. At the beginning of 2024, I want also to speak about the broader perspective. An ambitious approach is needed – I said it. What do we have to do? First of all, we have to come back to a very old idea in Europe. Belgium had already ratified the European Defence Union before it was stopped by the French National Assembly in 1953, nine years after the end of the Second World War. Another former Belgian Prime Minister and former NATO Secretary General, Paul-Henri Spaak, said rightly afterwards: ‘There are only two types of states in Europe: small states and states that have not yet realised that they are small’. Europe must stand united against Putin. Now it’s the right moment to build up a European defence pillar. We cannot have 180 different weapon systems while the US only has 30. Imagine how much we could increase our defence capabilities only with the introduction of a single market for defence systems. Let’s build up our own defence capabilities in the next years, for example, with a European missile defence shield, a cyber-brigade or even a nuclear shield. With ambitious investments in European defence, we can keep the biggest promise of Europe, and that is a promise of peace. Alongside defence, migration is a second important pillar for our family. We have to finally complete now this legislation. Le Pen, AfD and Orbán are trying to torpedo the European solution because they want to use the substance of this problem for their egoistic political benefit. They don’t want to solve the problem. They are the problem. And that’s why we must finalise this legislation. And my appeal today goes especially to the Greens. I understand that they are not yet decided whether they can support the final outcome of this migration deal. Imagine for a second the Migration Act failing in this House. Imagine for a second. That would mean that we help Le Pen, AfD and FPÖ, that we would fuel extremists all over Europe. And that’s why it’s now the moment to take over responsibility and finalise this migration deal. And the last point I want to mention is economic issues for us as the EPP. This will be the driving issue for this election campaign – to have jobs, to have good incomes, to have prosperity, to have a strong economy. Germany is already in recession and we need not another European traffic light coalition. What we need is economic strength for Europe and that is what the EPP will be asking for.",PPE,2024-01-17,4.

But they can’t start a global deep-sea mining race in the name of sustainability. Deep-sea mining would wreak havoc, with corporations dredging, digging and scraping the ocean floor, creating sediment plumes and dumping waste material, all away from the controlling eyes of the public. It would interfere with the ocean’s ability to capture carbon and would kill off species we haven’t even discovered yet. We do need certain materials for the green transition, but that does not mean we should destroy ecosystems with flimsy resource-scarcity arguments that don’t make sense and are against our international commitments. We have to stop a new environmental catastrophe before it begins, or Norway’s name will go down in history as being the country that kicked off the destruction of the deep sea.

Clare Daly,"Madam President, in the past few months, we’ve seen Palestinian solidarity decried as hate speech. We’ve seen claims of anti-Semitism being used to downplay the slaughter of innocents in Gaza and to cover up for the legitimate criticism of Zionism. And with all of this rage in the background, the EU decides to stomp onto the scene with plans to criminalise hate speech. The problem with that is: do we trust the EU to define hate speech? Do we trust them to ensure that it won’t be used to criminalise legitimate political speech and action? I have to say, I don’t. This has all the hallmarks of another clumsy and counterproductive neoliberal response to a social problem. It is cheaper to criminalise hate speech than to fund and focus on the strategies that might foster tolerance. It is a gimmick to allow politicians to pretend to care about minorities and racism and so on, while doing nothing to protect them, doing nothing to address the structural issues that lead to hate and intolerance in the first place, structural issues which include centrist politicians dog-whistling about migration.

Didier Reynders,"Madame la Présidente, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, les discours et crimes de haine représentent une menace grave, non seulement pour les victimes immédiates de tels actes, mais aussi pour l'ensemble de la société. Ils menacent les valeurs sur lesquelles l'Union européenne est fondée: les droits fondamentaux, l'égalité, la démocratie et l'État de droit. Ces dernières semaines, nous avons assisté en Europe à des scènes que nous espérions ne plus jamais voir. En particulier, nous constatons une augmentation alarmante de l'antisémitisme, mais aussi de certains discours de haine envers les musulmans. La Commission a pris des mesures. Le 6 décembre dernier, nous avons adopté, avec le Haut représentant pour les affaires étrangères et la politique de sécurité, une communication conjointe intitulée «No Place for Hate». Cette communication met en avant une série de mesures visant à renforcer la protection des personnes et des lieux de culte et à lutter contre la prolifération des discours de haine en ligne. Permettez-moi de souligner quelques unes d'entre elles qui sont particulièrement pertinentes pour le débat d'aujourd'hui. First, it is more important than ever to ensure effective application of current EU rules relating to hate speech and hate crime, namely the 2008 framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia. One of my personal commitments was to ensure that Member States correctly transpose this framework decision into national law. This is important to ensure that all EU citizens across the Union have the same rights and can fully exercise them. The Commission launched 13 infringement procedures relating to gaps in transposition and, since 20 October 2020, 10 Member States have taken action to change their legislation. Yet the criminalisation of hate speech across the European Union remains fragmented, and the framework decision only covers racist and xenophobic grounds. In December 2021, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council decision to include hate speech and hate crime in the list of EU crimes in Article 83 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. If the decision is adopted, the Commission would be able to propose a common approach to the criminalisation of hate speech and hate crime, ensuring a consistent protection of all victims of such acts across the European Union. While the Council had not yet reached the needed unanimity, the recent resurgence of hate speech and hate crime underlines the imperative for rapid adoption of this Council decision. We welcome the strong support and the commitment of the European Parliament for this initiative. We notably welcome the adoption of your report on this file. I would like to thank in particular the LIBE Committee and their rapporteur, Maite Pagazaurtundúa, for their commitment. Our recent joint communication also focuses on the need to respond to the threats of hate speech online. Since 2016, we have a code of conduct in place which aims to keep platforms accountable for curbing hate speech on their services. This code has been a success. According to the data we collect in our yearly monitoring exercise, content moderation has significantly improved, although a slight slowdown has been noted recently. But the digital landscape has evolved in the last years, in particular after the entry into force of the Digital Services Act in November 2022. The DSA requires all online platforms to have in place notice and action systems to allow for user reports on illegal content, including hate speech. Codes of conduct will continue to be an important tool under the DSA, in particular as part of the platform’s response to systemic risks. This is why we are advancing fast towards the adoption of a revised code of conduct. The main objective of the revision is to improve its preventive capability and help anticipate rising threats of hate speech before they go viral. I am confident that the negotiations will be concluded soon and that the new code will also be granted the status of a DSA code of conduct. Our December communication also recalls the importance of advancing on tackling antisemitism by intensifying the implementation of the 2021-2030 EU strategy on combating antisemitism and fostering Jewish life, the EU anti-racism action plan 2020-2025, as well as of the other equality strategies. After the attack by Hamas against Israel of 7 October and the war that ensued, antisemitic incidents have spiked both online and offline. Today, many European Jews are again living in fear, and some even feel obliged to hide their identity. At the same time, we have seen some increase in anti-Muslim hatred and indeed a general rise in hate speech, notably online. Combating racism and discrimination, countering negative stereotypes and ensuring equality in societies through positive action continues to be central. We are stepping up our efforts to fight hatred in all its forms by reinforcing action across a variety of policies, including security, digital, education, culture and sport. Finally, the joint communication provides that the Commission’s coordinators on combating antisemitism, anti-Muslim hatred and on combating racism will be upgraded to envoys, with a view to maximising the potential of EU policies to combat hatred. I thank you for your commitment to fight with us against all those forms of hate speech and hate crime, and I will be pleased to listen to your remarks and your proposal during this debate.",-,2024-01-17,14.

Mick Wallace,"Madam President, many people who have no connection to the farming community think that all farmers have a lot of money, and the truth is that some farmers do have a lot of money, but a whole lot of farmers don’t.   Now, the CAP system has certainly got a fair bit to do with it, and there’s a couple of sides to that. People resent the fact that farmers get cheques and get subsidised. Well, the reason being is that the EU insists on importing food from countries where people work for USD 5 a day, so we import cheaply, and in order to make that work, we have to subsidise the farmer at home. It probably make more sense if we actually paid the farmers properly for their produce, and maybe the people in the Global South might get a fair price elsewhere.   But a big problem as well is that, of the CAP money, 80 % of it is still going to the 20 % richest farmers, who actually don’t need any help at all. And that’s why in a country like Ireland, we are losing a family farm every day as a result of EU policies and Irish Government policies, who have protected big agri but have not protected 80 % of the farmers who are struggling. We are helping the wrong farmers. Ye are giving the money to the people who already have it, and you’re not giving it to the farmers that need it.

Seán Kelly,"A Uachtaráin, I think, first of all, I am very pleased with the support the farmers are getting from my group, the EPP. We see ourselves as the farmers’ party, but at the same time, farmers themselves feel not just not loved, but sometimes not appreciated and in some respects marginalised. And it isn’t Fit for 55 that’s the problem – it is the implementation of it and not getting recognition for the work they have done. An awful lot of good things are happening in farming to reduce emissions, but they’re not getting credit for it. Secondly, the red tape associated with it is overwhelming, so much so that Teagasc – the advisory group in Ireland for farmers – have no time now to visit any farms. Their whole time is taken up with filling in one form after another for all the various schemes. This has to change. And finally, calendar farming. There is no flexibility whatsoever. So farmers maybe, who have a tank full of slurry with cattle having to lie down in their own excrement, can’t do anything about it until a particular date is reached, which may not even be suitable to spread slurry. But that’s the way it is. A little bit of flexibility, a little bit of common sense would go a long way.",PPE,2024-01-17,"13.

Billy Kelleher,"Madam President, farmers and farming in general are critical elements of the strong, vibrant rural communities across all of Europe. In my own country, farming activities sustain villages and small towns, they provide incomes for families and support local businesses. Without farming, we would have no food security across Europe. So it annoys the hell out of me when I hear lazy commentary from some politicians dismissing the importance of farming and ignoring the valuable role farmers play in our economy and society. For the last 20 years, governments and the Commission have asked farmers to transform how they work their farms. Each and every day, the farmers have done what they have been asked to do. However, there are some politicians and bureaucrats who think that farmers should incur all the cost of this change. That’s wrong because some farmers have to be able to make a decent living so they can look after their families, service their debts, and invest in the local economy and their future. I’m glad that this debate is taking place on the issue of fair incomes for farmers, but we do need to do an awful lot more to ensure that we have vibrancy, that we have sustainability, that we have intergenerational transfer of family farms. We only have to look at the age profile to show that it is not an attractive profession at the present moment, and we have a lot of work to do to ensure sustainability in agriculture and fair prices for farmers for their work and their effort.",Renew,2024-01-17,"13.

Luke Ming Flanagan,"Mr President, this is a massively important topic. I used to get hope when I’d see the phrase ‘just transition’. But I have to say, every time I see the phrase ‘just transition’ at the moment, I feel like puking, because I’m not seeing any justice in this. I’m seeing elderly people going in, paying EUR 5 for little bags of wood, paying massive money for stuff with carbon tax on it – which is a good idea if it comes back to the poor people – but I’m not seeing it coming back to the people who need it. Farmers must be paid for public goods if there is to be a just transition. So when the Commission comes up with a plan to restore nature, but doesn’t provide money for it, or even a realistic possibility of finding money for it, how can you be surprised when farmers baulk at it? Now, some people will tell me there is money and some people have an idea of what you can live on. I met department officials last week and they tried to convince me by telling me that some people are getting EUR 4 000 a year. There are children of officials around here who get more than that in pocket money. Why would they get excited about EUR 4 000 a year? And I’ll finish by saying: they said there were 112 farmers in a certain scheme. The five people in the room were earning more out of their jobs than the 112 farmers put together. There is no justice if you don’t pay for it, and there’ll be no just transition if you don’t pay for it, and I bloody well will not support it.

Janusz Wojciechowski,"Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for organising this debate, which is timely and much needed, given the challenges that our farmers are facing today. In the face of these challenges, we are grateful to our farmers and all those working in the sector for the food security they continue to provide. This deserves our gratitude at all times, and especially in the extremely difficult times of past years. First, with the largest pandemic in over a century. Then a full-scale war in Europe for the first time in 80 years – and on top of this, the dramatic and increasing climate disasters in the form of droughts, wildfires and floods. Each of these crises have hit our farmers very hard. But in the face of these challenges, our farmers have continued to guarantee self-sufficiency in the European Union for most agricultural products, such as grain, meat, milk, as well as fruit and vegetables. For this, we are grateful. Indeed, between 2015 and 2022, added production in European agriculture increased by 28%, and income per unit of work in agriculture increased by 43%. Today, the European Union is the world’s largest food exporter. In 2022, the surplus of exports over imports amounted to EUR 58 billion. According to our data for the first nine months of 2023, from January to September, our surplus already amounts to over EUR 40 billion, with exports increasing by 5%, comparing to 2022, and imports decreasing by 2%. This is the success story of European agriculture. However, it is not the full story. There are also threats, which have raised growing concerns for our farmers, and I would like to address these concerns today. Farming protests, which have flared up in some countries recently, are largely rooted in national policies. However, we must also look at these concerns from the perspective of our EU policies. The first problem is Russia and its aggression against Ukraine. Firstly, I would also like to remind you of the aid provided to European Union farmers impacted by the war in Ukraine. We activated aid from the crisis reserve for this purpose. But above all, we included agriculture in the possibilities of extended national state aid. Thanks to this, in 2022 and 2023, farmers in 22 countries benefited from state aid, amounting to EUR 9.3 billion in total. This aid has provided crucial support to the farmers most in need. However, our full openness to agricultural imports from Ukraine has unfortunately brought significant competitive threats to many of our farmers, who face a market that has radically changed. In 2021, only 16% of Ukrainian agricultural exports went to the EU market. In 2022 and 2023 it is already more than half. In 2022, agriculture imports from Ukraine to the European Union almost doubled, from EUR 7 billion to EUR 13 billion. In 2023, agricultural imports from Ukraine will also exceed EUR 12 billion. The Commission remains committed to continue supporting Ukraine in these difficult times, while taking into account the European Union sensitivities. We are now discussing within the Commission next steps once the Autonomous Trade Measures expire by next June, and we will of course take all these elements into consideration. The second reason for farmers’ concern is related to the green transition. Firstly, let me say that during my time in office, the vast majority of farmers I have met have shared a deep concern about the environment and expressed a willingness to play their part in its conservation. However, many have also expressed concerns over their ability to comply with increasing regulations and legal obligations. Currently, this concern is not focused on the common agricultural policy, but rather on legislative initiatives outside the CAP – the Pesticides Regulation, the Industrial Emissions Directive and the Nature Restoration Law. I will not talk more about them, especially since they do not fall under my responsibility in the Commission. However, the common agricultural policy does fall under my responsibility. There is one ‘green’ element in the new CAP that has raised particular concern among farmers, and has been the subject of many initiatives, not only by farmers but also by Member States. This concerns GAEC 8 – in other words, the obligation to set aside at least 4% of arable land on farms over 10 hectares to ‘non-productive areas or features’. Last year we suspended this obligation by a delegated act of the Commission. This year, despite great pressure from farmers, we cannot repeat this derogation without amending the basic act. Taking a wider perspective, after one year of implementation, I believe that we have achieved a good compromise in the common agricultural policy strategic plans, striking a balance between the productive function of agriculture and the tasks towards the environment and climate. The common agricultural policy is working. Farmers have submitted application forms and are implementing eco-schemes. These are especially beneficial for active farmers, who receive payments for practices like carbon farming or animal welfare, for which they did not receive payments before. We were concerned that farmers would not take advantage of the eco-schemes and that some of the funds would be lost. However, I can assure you that this risk has not materialised and that all agricultural funds, over EUR 300 billion planned for 2023 to 2027, will be used. As our discussion relates to the socio-economic situation, let me mention that addressing labour and skills shortages in the agro-food sector is of paramount importance, with implications reaching beyond the sector itself to touch on broader concerns of food security. The shortage of manpower in the sector is a critical challenge that necessitates our immediate attention. It’s not just about the quantity of people; it’s about ensuring that those contributing to the sector enjoy favourable working conditions. Recognising this, it becomes imperative to persist in the implementation of social conditionality measures, and that Member States’ social and labour authorities properly enforce the social legislation for which they are responsible. Honourable Members, in recent weeks, farmers have raised their voice in protest, and over the coming months they will have the opportunity to raise their voice again: firstly, in our strategic dialogue on the future of agriculture and later in the European elections campaign. We cannot lose these opportunities. We must use them to listen, to engage and to work with our farmers. We must not let our differences be the cause of division. Too often, in our debates on food and farming, our differences present obstacles to finding solutions. But by combining our different perspectives, I believe we can create new solutions, and together we can grow a common vision for the future of European agriculture.",-,2024-01-17,"13.

Janusz Wojciechowski,"Mr President, thank you very much for a very interesting presentation in the discussion. The Commission is following the consequences of Norway’s decision very closely, and we are continuing our engagement with Norway in order to ensure the protection of the ecosystem from harmful activities for a healthy ocean in line with the Green Deal. The Commission takes note of these points raised by Parliament and shares many of the very same worries I have heard here today in the Parliament, since we are following these latest developments on deep sea mining very closely too. The European Union and Norway signed a Green Alliance in April 2023, building on existing dialogues and initiatives aiming to reinforce mutual cooperation and exchange best practices in the areas that are fundamental to the green transition. In the spirit of the Green Alliance, the Commission will keep an open line of communication with Norway and will continue discussing and sharing our concerns in order to ensure the protection of the marine environment and the fragile Arctic ecosystems.

Clare Daly,"Mr President, we sought to put this item on the agenda, because Norway is taking the world down a slippery slope to rip up the depths of the sea. And to make matters worse, they’re claiming they can do this environmentally destructive activity in a sustainable way. Now come on. What they’re actually doing is opening up an area the size of Italy to exploration for deep-sea mining, with the government inviting companies to bid for licences. This is the colonisation of the new frontier, the deep seas, where 90 % of the species present are unknown to humankind. It is some arrogance to say you can do this sustainably. We have a clear position on deep-sea mining. This House has repeatedly called for a moratorium because research tells us that too little is known about its real impacts. Extracting minerals from the deep ocean would have extremely serious consequences on our planetary systems, and do irreparable damage to marine ecosystems.

Robert Biedroń,"Madam President, dear Commissioner, dear colleagues, hate speech and hate crimes are our shared European problems. It is clear that with the internet and social media hate does not stop at any borders. It becomes widespread. It becomes our European problem. This is why we call again on the Council to take the decision to add hate speech and hate crimes to the list of EU crimes. I am disappointed that this seat today is empty. What is more, we need to ensure that sexist and gender-based hate speech will be explicitly defined in the legislation that will follow. Today, 52 % of women and girls have experienced online crime, including hate speech and sexual harassment. Women and minorities are targeted in the real world and online by individuals and as well by well-organised, far right and anti-gender movements who work to undermine our European values.

Anja Hazekamp,"Mr President, Norway’s decision to allow the seabed mining in the Arctic is very destructive for the vulnerable Arctic environment, even at the exploration state. The deep sea is the most extensive habitat on our planet and it supports high biodiversity. Scientists believe that as many as 10 million species inhabit the deep sea, an ecosystem that may be as rich as the tropical rainforest. The majority of species are yet to be discovered. The deep sea is also critical for other environmental services, such as long-term carbon sequestration. This kind of activity could quite literally start a global race to the bottom, a race to mine the ocean floor. The position of the EU is clear. The precautionary principle must be applied, and we need an international moratorium on deep seabed mining. We need to send a clear message to the Norwegian Parliament to withdraw their decision.",The Left,2024-01-17,12.

Sara Skyttedal,"Mr President, (start of speech off mic) ... on the initiative of the EPP Group – quality jobs in a competitive and future-oriented social market economy. In other words, we are essentially discussing the foundation of all other policies that this House may or may not want to pursue. I say so because sufficient funding is a prerequisite for all other political priorities, particularly the ones concerned with social policy. And I say so because, regardless of what socialists might claim, such funding can in the long term be available only as a result of increased European competitiveness, with better and more high paying, European quality jobs. What then must be done to achieve this foundational target? A lot, of course, especially considering the worrying trends of European competitiveness lagging further and further behind our global competitors. But I would emphasise three especially important areas of actions: better skills, a more competitive regulatory framework and an increased respect for the principle of subsidiarity. Firstly, the still ongoing European Year of Skills, however, is another EP priority and has been and is a success in promoting the mindset of reskilling, upskilling and innovation that must be centre stage in order to help our companies, in particular SMEs, with an urgent European skills shortage. The two Council recommendations adopted in this context are two good examples of concrete legislative actions already taken. European funding, for instance, from the Digital Europe programme to numerous research projects and public private partnerships, are in the same vein: prime examples of cases where European action creates an added value in the area of skills, in particular ICT skills. Secondly, better skills, however, will only carry us only so far if our regulatory framework is not of a similarly high qualitative standard. The good news is that while many of the skills of a competitive Europe indeed are quite advanced, the recipe for a more competitive regulatory framework is not exactly rocket science. European companies need more of a level playing field in relation to their global competitors, and this, in short, means that Europe needs to cut red tape. Several key actions have already been announced by the Commission. We must urgently get in place the reductions of the burden associated with reporting requirements for businesses by at least 25%, and we must work towards a regulatory moratorium in relevant, severely overregulated fields, while also ensuring, of course, that every new piece of legislation passes the standard of an EU competitiveness check. Lastly, we are talking about quality jobs in a social market economy. My sincere hope is that the Commission, as well as colleagues of a more federalist persuasion, will take to heart that such an economic model can only be built by respecting the principle of subsidiarity and the vastly different social models in the Member States. The important calls for European actions for a more competitive social market economy must not be confused for calls for centralised and streamlined social policies. With a more competitive Europe, with more and better higher paid jobs, we will be better off together, united in a prosperous diversity.",PPE,2024-01-17,11.

Esther de Lange,"Mr President, I think ‘you cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today’ pretty much sums up the core of the debate on the economic governance framework. We need to take responsibility to protect the credibility of the Union and the stability of the eurozone by agreeing on new rules that are realistic and can be and will be respected and enforced. This is why the Commission made a proposal that is more country-specific when it comes to achieving sustainable debt levels, which I welcome. This is why Parliament – in our negotiating position for which we asked for this House’s mandate today – introduces some additional flexibility to maintain room for much-needed investments in the key priorities of the Union, and I thank my rapporteur Margarida Marques and the shadows who made this possible. Now there will be those on the extreme right and the extreme left of the House that will vote against the mandate to deliver this better framework: no surprises there. What I find more regrettable is the position of the Greens: strong supporters of the Euro, but against the very rules needed to keep it strong and stable. Very much like having your cake and eating it. More regrettable also because the additional room for investments and the capacity to react to unforeseen circumstances needed so much for the green transition are part of the new framework and are part of Parliament’s mandate. Yes, ‘sustainability’ – or ‘stewardship’, as I call it as a Christian Democrat – means respecting our planet. But it also means not burdening next generations with unsustainable levels of debt.

Jaak Madison,"Mr President, dear few colleagues in the Chamber, dear Commissioner, first of all, I’m really wondering. I’ve seen also the news from Norway, where all the Greens and liberals are protesting against the plan. But, at the same time, the same Greens and leftists don’t have any kind of problem that we are acting as colonisers in Africa and in Congo to have those precious metals for the Green Deal. Because to drive with fancy, nice electric cars, to feel very green, to sleep in a better way, we need those metals. Today, currently, we can get it, especially from Africa and from Asia. You don’t worry about that, that you are using child labour in Congo who are earning less than 2 dollars per day, because you need those metals. At the same time, if there’s alternative for the seabed mining in Norway, then there’s a huge problem again. So what is the alternative? How can we make this, our Green Deal? How can we use those electric cars, if you don’t like the seabed mining? But you don’t worry at all about mining in Africa or in Congo, like in history, on the same way, not better at all. So, that’s the problem. Of course, the only result is that we have to end up with this kind of Green Deal ideology, which is absolutely crazy, because it doesn’t make sense.

Paolo Gentiloni,"Monsieur le Président, Madame la Ministre, honourable Members, the review of the economic governance framework has been a key commitment of this Commission, and the reform has long been due from our first public consultation in February 2020 before the COVID pandemic to the ambitious proposal we put forward in April of last year. Last month, we reached an important milestone with the general approach in the Council. Even if clearly deviating from the Commission’s proposal on some aspects, this was a significant step forward, and today we are reaching another major milestone in this House. Let me thank the rapporteurs and all the committees involved for their hard work. As we look ahead to the trilogues that will start this afternoon, it will be crucial to preserve the logic of our proposals, especially in four respects. First, moving to a risk-based, differentiated approach to ensure realistic and sustainable debt reduction. Second, building in strong incentives for investments and reform to support sustainable growth. Third, strengthening national ownership. And fourth, developing credible enforcement mechanisms. The Commission stands ready to facilitate the upcoming negotiations, aware of the importance of the role the Parliament will play in the decision process. But let me be clear, there is not much time to deliver. As the Minister representing the Presidency just said, with the European elections approaching and the recent deactivation of the general escape clause and the reintroduction of the pre-existing rules, it is both important and urgent that we finalise this dossier and provide clarity and predictability to fiscal policy. Because we all know the limits of the old rules that are the existing rules. In the current uncertain economic and geopolitical environment, let us not lose sight of the ultimate goal: a reform framework that allows for gradual debt reduction while making space for the massive public investments that Europe needs to successfully address the challenges before us.",-,2024-01-17,6.

Klemen Grošelj,"Mr President, when we speak of China as a direct or indirect owner of critical infrastructure, we need to bear in mind that its socio-political system is profoundly different from ours. The main element of the Chinese system is a full and complete military-civilian fusion that means the state leads state-directed programmes and plans to make use of all state and commercial power to strengthen the PLA. There are several security and defence risks associated with it: a risk of transfer of technology and technological know-how to companies directly or indirectly connected to China’s military; the risk of China’s monopoly in certain technology fields, such as batteries, silicon production, not to mention a monopoly on rare earths and other critical materials that constitutes a risk to EU defence and industry. Undersea cable communication is a third important security concern, due to the technology used, and services provided to EU diplomatic and military structures. As President von der Leyen said, we should not strive for decoupling from China, but rather de-risking. We need to develop a toolkit to efficiently address the EU security and defence concerns. European critical infrastructure remains vulnerable. Therefore, we need to develop a holistic model of screening foreign direct investments, as well as all actors involved in EU critical-infrastructure projects. We need a swift adoption, and full implementation, of an expanded regulatory framework to exclude entities that could have security implications for the EU, especially in the field of enabling technologies with military applications. Dual-use technologies need to be clearly defined and based on forward-looking criteria, and we need a legal framework to mitigate the security risks coming from the suppliers of undersea cable systems and services to prevent unauthorised intelligence and data gathering – and we must support and strengthen the resilience of our closest partners, especially candidate countries and strategic allies.

Billy Kelleher,"Mr President, by default, I’m an optimist. But at times we also have to be realistic. The European economy has faced many challenges over the last five years. Unfortunately, we are going to face many more over the next number of years. To reach our 2050 climate neutrality goals it is estimated that we will have to spend an additional EUR 360 billion per annum. Our populations are getting older, and many Member States are ill-prepared for the challenges and the cost that this will bring. It is estimated by 2050, most people will outlive their retirement savings by between 8 and 20 years. Meanwhile, the Commission warned this week that, whilst energy prices are stabilising, they will not return to pre-pandemic levels in the foreseeable future. This is all against the backdrop of the fact that 18 Member States currently have debt-to-GDP ratios of above 60%, or are running budget deficits of over 3%, or both – and we are going to deactivate the emergency escape clause this spring. It is clear to me, and to many experts, that we cannot return to the rigidity of the existing economic governance framework. We need a flexible, tailored framework that allows our Union to face the many challenges, while ensuring fiscal responsibility, debt consolidation, and encouraging investment and growth. This has been a difficult file to negotiate. The various political ideologies underpinning our different economic theories go to the heart of all our political groups. Therefore, I want to thank my fellow negotiators, and my colleagues in the Renew Group, for showing pragmatism and common sense. I also want to urge everybody in this House to support the mandate to go to trilogue. It would be grossly irresponsible, even reckless, if we were to delay or prevaricate this very serious issue any further. So I urge all to support the mandate. I am genuinely disappointed that the Greens will not support moving to trilogue.

Nicolas Schmit,"Mr President, dear representative of the Presidency, dear Members, let me thank you for choosing quality jobs as a subject for the topical debate of this plenary. This is timely in view of the current economic and social juncture. Fostering quality jobs in a future-oriented social market economy requires policies, investments and reforms to support innovative and competitive sectors and businesses while improving the working and living conditions of millions of people. A consistent and coordinated approach between economic, industrial and labour market policies is needed at EU and national level, building on the single market as a cornerstone of our social market economy. Over the last few years, the EU labour market has remained remarkably resilient in spite of the energy crisis, the pandemic, Russia's brutal war of aggression in Ukraine and the rising cost of living. And I think the figures have been mentioned by the representative of the President: unemployment has now stabilised at a record low of around 6%; in total, more than 216 million people are employed. However, there are still too many who are left out of the labour market, such as 8 million young people not in employment, education or training. The European economy is facing many challenges. First, the need to strengthen its competitiveness in a world that is less and less a rules-based system, governed by shared values. Second, the need to become future-proof by tackling the demographic, digital and also, most importantly, the green transition, the need to remain a social market economy, which is embedded in the DNA of the European project, which includes also social dialogue and collective bargaining. The roots of this model go back to the creation of the single market under the leadership of the late Jacques Delors, who combined competitiveness and social standards and social cohesion. Today, we see that labour shortages are a major economic challenge, notably driven by skills shortages, hurdles to labour mobility and legal migration, the need to improve activation policies and the poor working conditions of certain jobs and sectors. These challenges hinder fairness, sustainable growth, competitiveness and also innovation. Stakeholders, including social partners, tell us that this is a key concern for them. Europe can only be competitive if it is also social. To fully embrace the transitions and create quality jobs, we need to invest in our human capital, adapt our education and training systems, and reinforce our capacity to upskill and reskill our workforce, protect the health and safety of working people, particularly their mental health. This is why former prime ministers Mario Draghi and Enrico Letta have been tasked to design a path towards further strengthening our competitiveness and our single market. Social fairness and social cohesion must be at the heart of both endeavours. The pursuit of both is strongly linked to the global race for clean tech. We have key initiatives in place for this, the Green Deal industrial plan that enhances the competitiveness of Europe's net zero industry and is accelerating the transition to climate neutrality. A recent study shows that if we boost investments – private and public – in clean tech, we will not only be able to achieve our goals in reducing CO2 emissions, we also can – or will – create 2.4 million jobs. The same thing applies to the digital economy. The rapid expansion of this economy is another major aspect of our economic future. Artificial intelligence is transforming many jobs. It will allow us to restore a certain number of activities as the security of supply chains becomes more and more important. The consequences of algorithms have to be taken seriously, but the jobs of the future are very much linked to these technological developments. It will have an impact on many sectors. Given our demographic change, Europe's economic and industrial future depends on our capacity to be at the forefront of this technological revolution. This also means that we have to invest in the right skills, as well as in R&D and new companies, start-ups. Under Next Generation EU, the 27 national recovery and resilience plans, funded by the Recovery and Resilience Facility, make around EUR 250 billion available for green measures and a similar amount of money also for the digitalisation of our economy. Quality jobs are the fuel of the virtuous dynamic we aim at. Propelling a competitive economy in transition requires quality jobs and strong social protection induces also quality jobs. Quality jobs are based on safe and sound working conditions. We need fair and adequate remuneration as well as career prospects. And, as it has been said by the representative of the Presidency, equality and inclusive labour market equality means first also gender equality. Ending precariousness and ensuring quality jobs are especially important in sectors where working conditions must improve, such as the services, care and industrial sectors. These are the sectors where labour shortages are the most pressing. A firm commitment to quality jobs should also be reflected in the ongoing implementation of the national recovery and resilience plans. In the last five years, we have worked hard towards improving the quality of jobs in line also with the European pillar of social rights action plan; we are helping workers to ensure that work pays with the Minimum Wage Directive; we are supporting fair and decent working conditions with a certain number of measures or directives in the occupational safety and health and the proposed directive on platform work. And again, I refer to the conference the Swedish Presidency had organised on occupational safety and health. We are working on education, training and skills, which are key to quality jobs, with the implementation of the skills agenda of the European education area and the European year of skills you referred to.

Monica Semedo,"Mr President, today we discuss quality jobs that should boost Europe’s future economy.

Secondly, we need a legal basis for traineeships that best prepare for these jobs, especially youth. Traineeships that are of course fairly remunerated, as I requested in my report on the quality traineeships initiative.

Janusz Wojciechowski,"Mr President, as you know, on 9 January, the Norwegian Parliament decided to advance seabed mining in their continental shelf and extended continental shelf, some of which is in the Arctic. By doing so, Norway becomes the first country in the world to pave the way for commercial deep-sea mining. The Commission’s position on deep-sea mining in international seabed is very clear, and as stated in the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 and our International Ocean Governance Agenda adopted in June 22, we advocate for prohibiting deep-sea mining until scientific gaps are properly filled. Commission remains committed to this position until it is demonstrated that no harmful effects arise from mining. Furthermore, as required under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas, the necessary provisions in the exploitation regulations for the effective protection of the marine environment must be in place. This strong and long-standing position is science-based. The European Union, via its Research and Innovation framework programmes, has invested more than EUR 80 million in research projects related to the impacts of deep-sea mining to the marine environment and to environmentally friendly technologies. Studies clearly show that our current understanding of deep-sea ecosystem functioning and recoverability is still very limited, and that there is considerable uncertainty about the effects of mining on these processes. Long-term studies are needed to gauge the full range of impacts of mining on ocean biodiversity and ecosystem services, and their potential for recovery. Our concerns with deep-sea mining therefore relate to the protection and restoration of the marine environment, deep-sea biodiversity and the mitigation of climate change. As you know, nature does not respect our geographical barriers. Impacts of activities propagate beyond legal boundaries. We are very concerned by Norway’s decision and by the consequences it could have on the environment, including on fish stocks in that area. While it is Norway’s sovereign right to start exploring and/or mining the deep seabed on its continental shelf and extended continental shelf, the water column above the extended continental shelf is high seas. The high seas are now regulated by the newly agreed international legally binding instrument, which we call BBNJ, or Treaty of the High Seas, signed both by the European Union and Norway. The need to ensure sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction was what brought us this agreement. This must be considered as well as other international obligations of Norway, for instance under the Paris Treaty regarding Svalbard, together with the management of the fishing stocks in that area. Moreover, Norway is a contracting party to the so-called OSPAR Convention for the protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic, including Arctic waters, against the adverse effects of human activities. To this purpose, a roadmap to better protect the Arctic has been developed. Commission remains vigilant and fully committed to the protection of our ecosystems, whether on land or in the seas, whether here in Europe or in the global arena.

Nicolas Schmit,"Mr President, well, I thank you very much for this very lively and very rich debate on the different aspects of the European economy. We all agree that we are in an economic environment which needs us to improve and further develop our competitiveness. Competitiveness means better technology, investing in technology, investing in productivity, investing also in knowledge. This is the competitiveness of the future. Competitiveness is not a finality by its own. It has to have an objective and the objective is to make Europe stronger. But also to make Europeans better off, all Europeans. So there is the need also for the social aspect. I’m very happy that now we do not talk any more about creating jobs. We are talking about creating quality jobs. So it is not anymore what was the mantra some years ago when we talked about any job is better than no job. Now the objective is to create quality jobs, to be competitive, to be innovative, but also for social justice and social inclusion. But what does it mean – somebody asked that – quality jobs? It is not just about engineers. It is not just about professors. It is not just about intellectual work. It is also about the millions and millions of workers every day, but also they have the right to have quality in their job, to have the right to be recognised, to have the right to have fair working conditions. And as we are in Europe, in a situation where finally we are lacking people, we have to protect work; we have to protect the workers, their health, their skills, which we have to develop. So that’s a quality job. Is a platform worker who has a very low salary remuneration, who has no social protection, who has no right to have holidays, at least paid holidays – is that a quality job? I don’t think so. So I think this is where we have to improve our own commitment to create quality jobs. And what has been said about the social environment, about a fair balance between work and free time and family – that’s what makes a job a quality job.",-,2024-01-17,11.

But let me reiterate something I’ve said in this chamber many times before this debate: our policies are needed to ensure these quality jobs are more accessible and sustainable for women, and I welcome the Commissioner’s words on gender balance – because for women and mothers in the workforce, it’s simply not good enough.

Nicolas Schmit,"Madam President, I would first like to thank Madam Zovko, the rapporteur, and the other honourable Members who have actively contributed to this report, also on behalf of the High Representative, Vice-President Borrell. We know well that this House is a strong advocate of EU preventive diplomacy and actively contributes to shape the EU’s conflict prevention practice. The nature of conflict is shifting. Our time is increasingly marked by geopolitical rivalry and a resurgence of inter-state conflict. Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine is only one example of a return of violent tensions and major wars between nation states that we all hoped belonged to the past. With this geopolitical recalibration, we are also seeing a multitude of external actors weighing in on domestic and local conflicts, which increases the complexity of the conflict. The war in Gaza is a case in point, but so are the conflicts in Yemen, Syria, Libya, Sudan and in the Sahel – all stark reminders of the proxy dynamics at play. The accelerated geopolitical agenda forces us to put the focus on tackling the latest crises, but we should not forget the importance of looking ahead and trying to prevent conflict. According to the World Bank, each euro invested in prevention saves an estimated EUR 4 to the international community – up to EUR 65 billion a year. As a global actor for peace, conflict prevention is a key element of the EU’s values and a core foreign policy objective. We therefore will continue working to reinforce our action in all stages of the conflict cycle, particularly in its early steps before eruption, including through preventive diplomacy. At the same time, we need more efficient early warning systems and, more importantly, early action to avoid kinetic action down the road. Therefore, we welcome the recommendations included in your draft report, which are very relevant. Drawing from them, let me highlight some of the ongoing efforts to further develop the EU’s toolbox to better leverage its conflict prevention and peace mediation engagements. Since 2014, the EU conflict Early Warning System, based on statistics and intelligence, identifies countries at risk of conflict. We are currently adapting our data modelling to the new reality of conflicts, making it more dynamic and reflecting subnational trends. Thanks to the European Parliament, the NDICI-Global Europe Regulation included a requirement to develop conflict analysis in fragile and conflict-affected countries. Since 2020, the EU has developed more than 55 conflict analysis screenings – an unprecedented effort no other international organisation has undertaken. Our conflict analyses shape development cooperation programming and help to better plan and design EU CSDP actions. A good example is the analysis conducted ahead of the EU security and defence initiative in support of West African countries of the Gulf of Guinea, which includes a civilian pillar with a strong preventive focus. Most recently, we have reshaped our toolset to make it more efficient and better aligned with EU foreign policy needs. We included new types of conflict analysis with regional automatic focus, such as electoral violence, gender, hybrid threats or economics of conflict. Better shaped scenario analysis also feeds into strategic foresight. Let me also refer briefly to peace mediation – an essential means for preventive diplomacy. We are supporting peace mediation and dialogue in about 25 conflicts worldwide, predominantly in Africa and the MENA region, in many different forms. In some contexts, the EU acts as a facilitator. This is the case in the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue or the nuclear discussion with Iran. As you know, High Representative/Vice-President Borrell personally engages in all of this. Even though these processes are not linear and successes are not always easy to measure, mediation is without doubt a cost-effective tool. In other cases, the EU supports international, regional or local mediation and dialogue actors, be it international organisations or independent mediation organisations. Precisely because we know peace efforts need the involvement of the whole international community, the EU has developed conflict prevention and mediation partnerships. Of course, we work very closely with the UN – for instance in Yemen, Libya or Syria – but we increasingly coordinate also with the OSCE, with the African Union or ECOWAS. All this is very accurately reflected in your report, and we are glad to see that we can continue counting on the European Parliament to consolidate the EU toolset and our efforts on preventive diplomacy – from conflict analysis to conflict prevention, peace mediation and dialogue.",-,2024-01-16,14.

Janez Lenarčič,"Madam President, honourable Members, thank you for this debate, which I believe shows the importance – but also complexity – of the EU-India relationship. There is no doubt that a stronger EU-India partnership has a lot of potential on multiple levels – prosperity and security for our citizens, and society's, contribution to responding to global threats and challenges, such as regional peace and stability, the digital and green transitions, and also on reducing inequality and on improving global governance. Some of these areas already see notable progress, while in some others there is still scope to do more. And your report – and also this debate today – gives us very useful guidance in this respect, including on the sensitive issues, like the situation for human rights, the status of religious minorities, and so on. But I wish to conclude on the following note. This year is an electoral year, both in the EU and in India. And our joint strategy, the roadmap 2025, is coming to a close next year. With these circumstances in mind, together with the unfolding geopolitical and economic developments, I agree with your recommendation that there is a need to start reflecting without delay on the updated – or future – priorities for our strategic partnership with India.

Željana Zovko,"Madam President, dear Commissioner, dear colleagues, this report is calling for lessons learned where we have made some progress and is also keen to rethinking our policies in order to be better prepared, more coordinated and more focussed on preventing future crises. First of all, I would like to thank my colleagues, shadow rapporteurs from other political groups for their serious and constructive approach during the negotiations on this report. With the Russian war against Ukraine, we have a war that is threatening our countries as well. The war in the Middle East and the situation in the Red sea are a clear reminder that we have set aside all these conflicts without addressing the consequences that we have to be dealing with – from Ukraine to Venezuela, from the South Caucasus to the Western Balkans, crises are popping up and seeking immediate response, for which we need strong coordination in this current, weakened, multilateral world. Ten years after the establishment of the European External Action Service, discussions are still ongoing about the lack of a single voice related to the EU’s external policy and the European Union’s global role. Political leaders have still not found the visionary approach to start building that railroad to prevent conflicts, to fully align and act as a caretaker of the tragedies that we are facing in this volatile world. The global order is changing rapidly. Emerging powers are confronting traditional players. New technologies and further global globalisation are leading to increased international competition. In recent years, our achievements have deteriorated, our presence weakened, and our actions left without concrete results. Just think about the Western Balkans, Africa, the South Caucasus, Cyprus, Northern Ireland, Afghanistan and the Middle East that encouraged other actors to take advantage of our lack of interest, putting themselves in an active and malign role in our own backyard. Dear colleagues, we have to ask ourselves the question why has the EU failed on preventing violent outbursts throughout the years? Exactly this thought was on my mind when I initiated this parliamentary report in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, with the intention of launching a ‘lessons learned’ exercise on the European efforts in preventive diplomacy over the years. The report is based on the need to improve the visibility of the European Union in this field of analysis, with six main areas that can be upgraded and improved for the prevention of conflicts around the world. It emphasises the importance to learn from missed opportunities and draw lessons from past experiences. The text also reiterates that the key focus should be on strengthening the EU early warning system, advocating proactive risk analysis and continuous evaluation to improve effectiveness, underscoring the need for interventions tailored to specific contexts. The report highlights the importance of aid responding to countries’ unique cultural, historical and political contexts. It points out that it is crucial to take into account the local cultural and historical background when appointing EU special representatives and envoys to avoid controversies in conflict areas and their role as impartial mediators. Furthermore, the need for a thorough evaluation of their work is emphasised, including the European Parliament’s supervision of their initiatives, results and contribution to preventive diplomacy. Despite being the largest donor of development aid, the results of this investment in public diplomacy are almost insignificant and often overridden by false narratives presented by other major powers present in developing countries. The adopted text also emphasises that international coordination in conflict prevention is crucial and calls on the EU to strengthen cooperation with other organisations on this issue. My hope is that all these recommendations will bring the European Union one step closer to becoming a more visible actor in conflict prevention and resolution worldwide. The fear of conflict is easy to be put to flame again if the seed of hope does not replace the flame of hatred that is left behind, and rebuilding bridges and finding solutions for frozen conflicts and unhealed grievances is the seed for preventing future wars and tragedies. I count on your support.",PPE,2024-01-16,14. Role of preventive diplomacy in tackling frozen conflicts around the world – missed opportunity or change for the future?

Mick Wallace,"Madam President, this report claims the EU can play a positive role in preventive diplomacy in tackling frozen conflicts around the world. The past two decades are a dramatic demonstration of how the EU does precisely the opposite: Kosovo, Syria, Nagorno-Karabakh, Ukraine, Israel, Palestine. Just look at the genocide taking place at the moment in Gaza. We haven’t time to go back over all the colonial exploits of European powers and the imperialists, carving up large parts of the world with complete disregard for the ethnic and religious communities on the ground. But European colonialists did lay the ground for the Israeli settler colonial project, and then supported the apartheid state of Israel for over 75 years, while they systematically brutalised and butchered the Palestinians. When the Israeli genocide of Gaza began on 7 October, the EU ran out to their defence. Presidents von der Leyen and Metsola literally flew out there and pledged EU support, no matter what was to come. You say the EU can limit the spread of conflicts. The Council still hasn’t called for a ceasefire. Sadly, the EU is part of the problem.",The Left,2024-01-16,14.

Thomas Waitz,"Madam President, dear colleagues, preventive diplomacy means action before a conflict escalates, and it’s quite difficult, actually, to get resources and attention for conflicts that have not yet escalated. We have to be aware of that. And just to bring a concrete example, I mean, in Bosnia, we have massive tensions between ethnic groups, mainly steered by Mr Dodik’s Republika Srpska. I think we should not wait until this conflict escalates, but really put our efforts into easing the tensions as much as possible. We, the European Union, consider ourselves a power for peace, but that also comes with an obligation. It comes with the obligation to put attention and resources, to prevent civilian victims, to prevent human suffering, and to prevent destabilisation, also through an accelerating climate crisis, together with diplomatic services, together with civil society and together with the local population. There’s a lack of preventive diplomacy and that is the outcome we can see in and around the Europe in the moment. So let’s learn the lessons of this and put preventive diplomacy at the core of our diplomatic services. I think we should do the learnings and move on onto this. Thanks a lot to Željana Zovko for good leadership on this report. I think we found very good compromises, which we Greens will support.",Greens/EFA,2024-01-16,14.

Clare Daly,"Madam President, so we’re here today celebrating the EU’s great role in preventive diplomacy. What an absolute joke! When the truth is that the EU has been seriously active not in preventive diplomacy, but in preventing diplomacy. We’ve had two years where the very concept of diplomacy has been smeared as a Russian plot. You’ve pulled out all the stops to smash the slightest chance of dialogue in Ukraine. Where was the preventive diplomacy in 2020 and 2021, when at least France and Germany tried to reduce the tensions with Russia? But the EU flung itself behind the US and NATO belligerence. And it’s the poor people of Ukraine with their smashed state who are living with the consequences of that. Meanwhile, 101 days into the genocide in Gaza and the EU hasn’t even managed to call for a ceasefire, while this report has the audacity to claim that the EU always seeks to reduce the risk of escalation. No, it doesn’t. You’re fooling nobody. It’s time to abandon rampant militarism and stop hurtling down the wrong road of history.",The Left,2024-01-16,14.

Nicolas Schmit,"Madam President, this very interesting debate – although sometimes a bit surprising – illustrates the importance and complexity of preventive diplomacy in the current geopolitical context. Our time is increasingly marked not only by starker polarisation – the multi-polarity adds to this complexity, especially when we look at the different conflicts. The EU was created as a peace project between nations that opposed each other in two bitter world wars. From these painful experiences rose one of the world’s most successful political entities in history, which brought unprecedented stability and prosperity to its members. It should be, by the way, a good lesson for everybody that peace is possible and has good results. But preventive diplomacy is a collaborative effort. And to face today’s challenges, it is more important than ever that we, as the EU, speak with one voice. And to have a weight in international relations, it is the EU that has to be present and has to speak with one voice. This is crucial if we want to enhance meaningful and solid partnerships for successful conflict prevention and resolution globally. That is why your report is very timely and welcome. And I want, in the name of Vice-President Borrell, to thank you very much for it and especially also for your continued support.",-,2024-01-16,14.

Željana Zovko,"Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his kind words and to thank all the colleagues for contributing to this very, very rich debate. This is the beginning of our rethinking about what the European Union should do in order to have a more unified voice, in order to maintain its economic and diplomatic strength globally. First of all, we need to rethink our foreign policy-making and invest more in the prevention of the challenges that we are facing. The European Union must seek to prevent conflict before a crisis emerges or violence erupts. This must be a constant and high priority for all EU diplomatic engagements. it is not only when CNN cameras are around that the main people should come. But we must resolve the conflicts, and as my colleague Nacho said, it is very important to address, to understand cultural and historical background and to have people listened to and to have respect. I remember many years ago the late President Chirac told me – I was ambassador in Paris – the main thing is respect, listening and respecting people. He was one of the key people for signing the Dayton-Paris Peace Accord. So in order to prevent and to keep peace, we must understand others and we must invest in peace. Because this, as you rightly said, the whole investment in peace and prevention, pays off – but it pays off because history will ask us where we were when this investment and this human effort was made.",PPE,2024-01-16,14.

David McAllister,"Resurging conflicts in Europe have once again reminded us of the worthy investment that preventive diplomacy entails. The logic of preventive diplomacy is in the genes of the European Union – indeed at its very genesis – and elements of prevention emerge in all our major strategy and policy documents. Article 3 of the Treaty on the European Union states that ‘the Union’s aim is to promote peace, its values and the well-being of its peoples’, further specifying in Article 21(2)(c) that the EU shall work to ‘preserve peace, prevent conflicts and strengthen international security’. Yet, we encounter obstacles in ‘selling’ the need for preventative engagement, both internally and externally. Beyond geopolitical circumstances, the case for preventive engagement remains strong – not only considering the moral, but also the economic imperatives. So, let us politically renew our emphasis on early warning, gear funding programmes towards long-term investment, enhance political buy- in to the logic of prevention and reinforce the culture of preventive diplomacy among EU Member States.",PPE,2024-01-16,14.

Emily O’Reilly,"Madam President, honourable Members, Commissioner, let me begin by wishing you a happy and, hopefully, a peaceful new year, and by thanking rapporteur Jahr, the shadow rapporteurs and the Petitions Committee as a whole for its unanimous endorsement of our work in 2022. An ombudsman’s office cannot be successful without the support and confidence of the parliament that it reports to. This new year is widely viewed as one that will test the strength of our democracies, as countries representing more than half of the world’s population will hold elections. The choices made in the United States and in India, for example, will affect international cooperation, global security, the fight against climate change and much more. Europeans will also elect the MEPs they want to represent them for the next five years. As Parliament’s influence continues to grow, the choices that EU citizens make will have a profound impact on the EU’s handling of everything from the economy and the environment, to defence and the protection of our democratic institutions. A strong democracy is one in which citizens can trust those who make such profound decisions on their behalf. I acknowledge the progress that this institution has made so far in strengthening its ethics framework following the cash for influence scandal. The goal must now be to reassure citizens that the newly adopted rules will be thoroughly implemented and rigorously enforced. Without that, the new rules are just words on a page. In 2022, my office saw a slight increase in the number of complaints when compared to 2021. The number of inquiries we opened also rose accordingly. Common topics included transparency and accountability, a culture of service on the part of the institutions, and respect for fundamental rights. Access to documents was once again an important area of my work in 2022. Following an increase in complaints regarding delays, I opened an own- initiative inquiry into the time it takes the Commission to deal with access requests. I found that when people asked the Commission to review an initial access decision, because it refused or only granted partial access to the requested documents, the Commission misses the deadline set out in the EU’s Access to Documents Regulation in 85% of cases. Over 60% of these review decisions also took more than 60 working days, despite a maximum limit of 30. Long delays are not merely an inconvenience: they can prevent citizens from effectively participating in the decision-making process at key moments. They may also render the information eventually obtained no longer useful for researchers or journalists or citizens. Access delayed is effectively access denied, and further serves to weaken that necessary trust that there must be between frequently powerless citizens and very often very powerful institutions. We need to remember that democracy is not only eroded when an authoritarian leader moves to dismantle or undermine democratic institutions. It is also eroded in small ways, such as in failing to allow citizens access to documents that they have a right to access, and with the administration reasonably confident that few of those citizens will challenge them in court. I have called on the Commission to adopt a fundamental change in approach to meeting deadlines. Recent inquiries have shown that the problem, however, continues to persist, and that is why I asked this institution for its formal support via a special report. I was happy to participate in the positive discussions that have already taken place in the LIBE Committee, and I look forward to the debate and resolution in plenary on my special report. In 2022, I looked again at how the EU administration handles moves by its staff to related roles in the private sector – a phenomenon known as ‘revolving doors’. I called on the European Central Bank to apply stricter rules to these moves, especially when they concern the financial sector. In particular, I suggested that more staff be subject to stricter cooling-off requirements and that the ECB increase the ban on former senior staff lobbying their past colleagues to one year. Another area I looked at was citizen participation and how the EU administration interacts with stakeholders and lobbyists. For example, when it comes to implementation of the common agricultural policy, I called on the Commission to ensure it consults a balanced representation of stakeholders, which not only includes representatives of the agricultural industry but also of civil society. With the droughts, forest fires, floods and other natural disasters increasing across our continent, and last year being the warmest on record, the fight against climate change is of vital importance to Europeans. In 2022, I carried out a public consultation to evaluate whether citizens have the opportunities and up-to-date information they need to participate in decision-making related to the environment. Respondents identified a number of concerns, including a lack of transparency around lobbying, difficulty in accessing information concerning trilogue discussions and trouble with access to document requests. I have already opened one inquiry following the consultation, which concerns the risk management of dangerous chemicals and am looking into other possibilities. In relation to fundamental rights, I identified several areas where Frontex could improve its accountability. These include publishing summaries of its operational plans, providing further training to its fundamental rights monitors and ensuring cultural experts are present during screening interviews. I also inquired into how the Commission monitors EU Structural and Investment, or ESI, Funds, to ensure they promote the rights of persons with disabilities to independent living and inclusion in the community. I suggested that the Commission provide clearer guidance to Member States and to its own staff about the need to promote these goals through EU funding, not only through ESI but also through the newer Recovery and Resilience Facility. Another high point of 2022 was to welcome the Ombudsmen of Ukraine and Moldova to the European Network of Ombudsmen, which I have the honour to coordinate. In my 10 years as European Ombudsman, I have seen much positive change in the EU administration as a whole, but also in the work of my own office. In 2022, we closed 48% of all inquiries within three months and 86% of inquiries within one year. In 2013, when I took office, those figures stood at 22% and 59%, respectively. These marked improvements in efficiency have allowed us to provide better service to citizens, while also more effectively holding the EU institutions to account. To conclude, the year ahead may be a challenging one, but it also provides an opportunity to unite Europe with the citizens in a way that exemplifies the best of the Union – one that remains faithful to its foundational values and does not bend with contrary and dangerous winds. As Ombudsman, I will continue to do all that I can do to respond to people’s concerns and promote good administration. In doing so, I hope to do my part in furthering citizens’ trust in the EU and in its democratic institutions. Thank you for your support.",-,2024-01-16,15.

Mick Wallace,"Madam President, it would seem that the great hopes for India as Washington’s counterweight to China, have been shelved for the moment. India refused to get on board with the Russian sanctions, and the two countries are busy strengthening defence cooperation and trade relations, while it seems the US and China have made some steps towards de-escalation in their trade war.

Hadja Lahbib,"Madam President, honourable Members, dear Janez, what a passionate debate. And, I must say, this is always the case when we speak about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Indeed the violence that we see day after day coming from the region is unbearable and must stop. Too many children, women and men have died already. And these deaths, be it on the Israeli or Palestinian side, tarnish and damage our humanity. But we need rationalism. And indeed, I agree with you, Commissioner. In any future scenario, for the day after the Palestinian Authority must be reinvigorated and ultimately we turn to Gaza. We all agree that there is no place for Hamas rule, nor does anyone want a return of Israeli occupation. The Palestinian Authority should be strongly supported to regain control of Gaza. In parallel, and as and as I said in my introduction, we will step up our work on alleviating the suffering of civilians in Gaza and elsewhere. We will renew our efforts to prevent further escalation and finding a way out of the current crisis. We will prepare the ground for a lasting and sustainable regional peace, and the only way for that is a two-state solution based on international parameters. We take note of South Africa’s application to the International Court of Justice, instituting proceedings against the State of Israel concerning alleged violations by Israel of its obligations under the 1948 Genocide Convention in relation to the Palestine Palestinian people in Gaza. The ICJ is currently holding public hearings on South Africa’s request for the indication of provisional measures. The EU cannot be a party to, or intervene in, a contentious case before the ICJ. The EU is firmly committed to the rules-based international order. As a principal judicial organ of the United Nations, the ICJ is a pillar thereof and has a vital role to play in the peaceful settlement of disputes.

Tatjana Ždanoka,"Madam President, colleagues, Commissioner, as a member of the EPP delegation, which recently had a very successful mission to Delhi and Mumbai, I would like to underline the need for mutually respectful, equal dialogue with India. To my regret, the report – and especially its chapter on human rights and democracy – violates this principle. The report calls for shared action and leadership in the global arena on many issues such as climate, the environment, transport, energy, digitalisation, health.

Nikos Papandreou,"Madam President, colleagues, that India is an important trading partner, there’s no doubt, and under the good stewardship of Rapporteur Alametsä, for a change, all the political parties agreed on this report without many changes. That shows how much importance we give to, I would say, a new day. Why is it a new day? Because we have huge geopolitical shifts going on. Today, China and Russia are not looked at the same way we looked at them ten years ago. India is now seen not only as a trade and a cultural partner, but as a strategic partner that perhaps could take the place of our past partners and present partners like China and others. The country, we agree, is a stabilising force in the Indo-Pacific region. It is important that it keeps major sea routes open and provides stability and security in the region as a whole. We call for redoubling of the efforts in non-proliferation for nuclear weapons and, in a relatively energy-deficient country, we still ask it to reduce its dependence on Russian oil. But I think we need to propose alternative energy as the replacement. India is a natural partner for the greening of the globe. Its technical proficiency and technical advances in renewable energy are an obvious area for mutual cooperation. Solar panels, pumped storage, cheap hydrogen and significant digital expertise are a strong foundation for creating a more competitive Europe and a more competitive India. In keeping with the emphasis that Europe places now on human rights – something that it didn’t do 20 or 30 years ago in its trade agreements – it would be remiss if we did not take a strong stance on these issues. Our report points out significant deviations from the strict norms of a full Western-style democracy. We do not expect a country with such a great history and tradition to move suddenly into the nirvana of a democratic world. However, we do expect the largest democracy in the world to move forwards and not to move backwards with respect to human rights and rule of all. Over time, we hope it comes closer and closer to the values that we hold dear. To quote from the report itself ... (The President cut off the speaker)",S&D,2024-01-16,13.

Alviina Alametsä,"Madam President, dear listeners, dear colleagues, I am honoured to present the Parliament’s recommendation to the Council, Commission and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs on the EU-India Partnership. The relationship between the EU and India, the most populous country and fifth largest economy in the world, is increasingly important. Both India and the EU are needed in the fight against climate crisis and in advancing global security. The partnership is necessary, for example, for development and transformation to sustainable energy, for promotion of human rights and democracy and rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific region and elsewhere. The current EU-India roadmap that guides our partnership with India will conclude next year. Now is the right time to step up our ambitions for the future and discuss them in the high-level summit in New Delhi. These themes were also discussed widely during our visit to New Delhi and Mumbai in December with the European Parliament delegation. I thank everyone for this trip. India and the EU share many challenges, from the climate and ecological crisis to security, environment and rapid global technological developments. Now, more than ever, we need international cooperation. We need international diplomacy. India can also be our partner in strengthening our diplomacy with others. It is able to speak with the voice of the Global South, and able to help us break the North-South divide and work more together globally. We also need very strong parliamentary cooperation. As highlighted in our report, we should explore ways to establish a structured interparliamentary dialogue between this Parliament and our Indian counterparts. We found this very beneficial, for example, during our journey in India. Cooperation between the EU and India has to be based on shared values, promoting democracy, the rule of rule of law, human rights and international law and always, always aiming to improve the lives of our citizens. We must address the issues of human rights and democracy that are prevalent and bring them to the heart of our partnership. It might be difficult, but it is something that the EU has to work for, as well as India. I would like to thank all of my colleagues for their cooperation in developing this recommendation. I trust that together we have created a report that this Parliament can stand behind, and I am very much looking forward to listening to all of the contributions from my colleagues to this debate.",Greens/EFA,2024-01-16,13.

Janez Lenarčič,"Madam President, honourable Members, thank you for this very important debate. I would like to refer to one point that was made by several speakers: the call for the EU to play an active role in addressing the current tragic, catastrophic situation in Gaza and beyond. I wish to assure you that the EU is committed to playing this role, an active role. First, on the humanitarian front, the EU is the leading provider of humanitarian funding for Gaza and for Palestinians in general. This shall remain so. And we shall not tire of calling for respect for international humanitarian law, in particular protection of civilians, unconditional release of hostages and unfettered provision of humanitarian aid throughout Gaza to all people who need it. Second, the EU is committed to playing an active role to prevent the escalation of this conflict region-wide. I would like to recall that earlier this month, High Representative Borrell travelled to the region precisely with this ambition. Third, the EU is also committed to playing an active role in pursuit of lasting peace in the region based on a two-state solution, and we are already working on the scenarios for the day after. But let me underline one particular point. It would help us and increase our leverage if there were one voice with which the European Union would speak, including the strong voice of this House. That would increase our leverage, that would facilitate our playing an active and effective role in this region. We do hope that it would also bring closer the so-called day after. It is clear that for the day after, there shall be no place for Hamas to rule in Gaza or anywhere else. And for the day after, there should be a reinvigorated Palestinian Authority able to take over Gaza. We’ll continue to engage with our regional and international partners on all that, and we do remain committed to a lasting and sustainable peace based on a two-state solution and we are ready to reinvigorate all efforts to revive the Middle East peace process.",-,2024-01-16,"12.

There is now potential famine, hunger, disease, no access to basic medications. And we still cannot condemn Israel’s actions of massive proportions against the civilian population of Gaza. Let us be very clear: what happened on 7 October was appalling. But what has been happening to the Palestinian people for decades is appalling and is a crime against humanity.

Barry Andrews,"Madam President, Commissioner, colleagues. We should never tire of condemning Hamas and the way in which they have conducted this war with no regard whatsoever for the civilians in Gaza. However, I want to focus on the humanitarian situation. Israel has blamed variously the United Nations, the Egyptian authorities, NGOs and Gazans themselves for the failure to deliver humanitarian aid, blaming – and I quote – ‘the capability of the international organisations inside Gaza to receive this aid’. The facts on the ground do not bear this out. Israel operates a dual-use list that it has not published, and no humanitarian organisation has had sight of. Trucks previously cleared for entry can be turned back arbitrarily if a single item is rejected. For example, absurdly, a tent pole in an Irish aid consignment, the entire consignment has to go back and be unloaded and reloaded. There are those who say, ‘let’s talk positively’, ‘what are the positive proposals’? But Israel has repeatedly rejected calls to internationalise the inspection process. It is therefore impossible not to conclude that Israel is deliberately frustrating the distribution of humanitarian aid. We need a ceasefire immediately.

Baked babies, women raped to death again and again. Committed by a criminal organisation now hiding behind Palestinian children. Shooting missiles on Israeli civilian cities. We need to ask ourselves where our responsibility lies, for more humanitarian aid, more pressure on Israel to make this humanitarian aid accessible for more restraint of Israel and more humanitarian law respect. Our responsibility for being too passive in any attempts to reach a durable and just two-state solution. During the last years, our responsibility for tolerating Hamas, a leadership in Gaza with a genocidal ideology, and our responsibility today to help Palestinians, but not by pouring fuel into fire by using unverified figures, with populist TikTok diplomacy, which helps to get more likes rather than more help for Palestinians. We must engage immediately in the region for a durable two-state solution, instead of projecting our own demons on victims of our own European genocides.

Marc Angel,"Madam President, dear European Ombudsman, Emily O’Reilly, dear Executive Vice-President of the Commission, dear colleagues, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Jahr, and all our shadow rapporteurs for the work done on this file. Most importantly, I would like to thank our European Ombudsman, Ms O’Reilly, and her wonderful team, for their tireless efforts to improve the standards of EU administration over the past 11 years. Transparency, accountability, and compliance with fundamental and human rights obligations are essential elements that were investigated by the Ombudsman and her office in 2022. Those values are the core of our Union, and I am glad to see that the Ombudsman’s recommendation helped to improve the functioning of our institutions with tangible results. I particularly welcome the inquiry on the revolving door policies of the Commission and of the European Central Bank, as well as the inquiry on the handling of work-related texts and instant messages. For the Socialists and Democrats Group, it is important that our institutions must follow closely the Ombudsman’s recommendations. At the current stage, more needs to be done to reach an appropriate level of accountability in European public administration. Systemic and significant delays in how the Commission handles requests for public access to document still exist, and this is unacceptable and rightly considered as maladministration. It is unacceptable that citizens and journalists have to wait – sometimes up to 15 months – before the Commission processes their requests. The Council’s refusal to give full public access to documents related to some negotiations is also a worrying sign of widespread structural problems. The European institutions need to take concrete steps in this regard. Transparency lies at the basis of our citizens’ trust, and today, more than ever, it is essential to demonstrate our ability to keep promises and maintain high accountability. I would also like to thank our Ombudsman for the excellent coordination work she does with the enlarged European Network of Ombudsmen. As a Vice-President, I can tell you that this Bureau has been very active this last month to strengthen our transparency rules and our accountability here in the Parliament. It was good that you mentioned it too. I thank you and your team very much for your good work.",S&D,2024-01-16,15.

Along with our strongest condemnation of the events on 7 October, we reiterate our calls to Hamas to realise to release all the remaining hostages. The ongoing conflict has become regional, accompanied with even more significant global implications. These will mostly be to the detriment of the European Union. Humanitarian aid cannot be part of political games. Instead, it must be based on clear conditionality rules that are being respected. Further to the facilitation of humanitarian aid, we need a political solution and the ceasing of the series of military actions that continue causing civilian victims. Every country, including Israel, has the right to defend itself within the limits of international law. The only viable, hopefully feasible solution is for two sovereign and democratic states living side by side in peace and security. The European Union should mobilise all its efforts to achieve it.",S&D,2024-01-16,"12.

We can thank our Ombudsman and her team and her office for important work done in that year. I also would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Jahr, the coordinators of the PETI Committee and all its members involved for this annual exercise, providing the views of the European Parliament on the issues that it considers noteworthy in the area of good administration for citizens, businesses and associations. As highlighted in the report and resolution, the work of the European Ombudsman is important to improve administrative practices and to promote accountability and full transparency of the EU institutions. This is essential for EU citizens, businesses, associations, but also for the EU administration, because EU administration should always strive to achieve its highest standards in this respect, and even more now this year, where the EU citizens in the 27 Member States will be called to vote for the European elections. The European Commission remains the main addressee of the European Ombudsman’s inquiries and initiatives, with 197 inquiries and initiatives out of 348 launched in 2022, representing 57.1% of the total, a slight decrease compared to the 61.5% in 2021. These figures also reflect the fact that the European Commission is the largest EU institution, which has many interactions with the citizens. Against this backdrop, the European Commission remains fully committed to acting with due respect, due diligence and the highest responsibility towards the citizens’ expectations and demands. Although in some cases there might be disagreements, the fact that it is very rare that an inquiry ends up with the final closing decisions of maladministration is an indication that constant dialogue and mutual understanding can provide tangible and concrete results. Indeed, the European Ombudsman’s solution proposals, suggestions for improvement and recommendations are taken into account and implemented by the Commission whenever feasible. The report and resolution refers to important issues such as, among others, the interaction between the European Commission and the tobacco industry; the means for ensuring independence and no conflict of interest in advisory and expert groups; the so-called revolving doors phenomenon; the ethical and transparency rules applying to Commissioners; the transparency of the EU environmental decision-making process of negotiations of trade agreements; or the Recovery and Resilience Facility funding issues related to the Common Agricultural Policy, as well as the handling of requests for public access to documents or concerns regarding fundamental and human rights. As usual, the European Commission will duly examine the European Parliament’s resolution in the coming weeks and will reply in detail to all the issues that concerns the Commission, including relevant updates. We remain committed to implementing the highest standards in the European public administration.

It is discouraging to see the results of the specific inquiry into the time taken by the Commission to reply to requests. When it comes to asking the Commission to review its initial decision, receiving an answer above the 30 day legal limit has become the norm, not the exception.

Adina-Ioana Vălean,"Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank Mr Moreno Sánchez. The Commission welcomes the very balanced European Parliament implementation report on the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement, which reflects the overall success this agreement has been and the benefits it delivers every day. On 21 September 2023, we celebrated the sixth anniversary of CETA’s provisional application – and there was a lot to celebrate! In six years of CETA’s provisional application, the increase in trade on both sides of the Atlantic is remarkable. Trade in goods increased by 66%. Agricultural trade increased by 54%. Trade and services reached a new record high in 2022, with a 62% increase and both sides benefit, and across EU Member States – big and small ones. CETA has helped us to jointly resist pressure on supply chains in the challenging past four years through a pandemic, economic tensions and Russia’s war against Ukraine. During the pandemic, Europe showed its solidarity by exporting vaccines to Canada, and CETA has been crucial in our respective efforts to diversify away from Russia since February 2022. Imports from Canada went up by 25% during 2022, notably for raw materials and energy products. For example, our imports of fertilisers went up by 225%. At the same time, Canada has been a key market for our products affected by sanctions. EU exports to Canada of its products increased by 45%. That is also closely interlinked with new initiatives we are engaging in with Canada. Already we have a strong strategic partnership on raw materials, and recently we also sealed the digital partnership and EU-Canada Green Alliance. Canada will also formally become associated to Horizon Europe in 2024. We should also flag that the European Commission has now started the process of a detailed ex-post evaluation of CETA, including a lot of stakeholder consultations, to fully analyse what works and what does not, and draw lessons for the future. Also, count on our close exchanges with the European Parliament in this process. CETA is a real success story, but let’s not be complacent. It is working very well, but it is still only provisionally applied and CETA at this stage is not yet fully in force, but only provisionally applied. As of 1 January 2024, only 17 of the 27 Member States have fully ratified it, and we want to see it ratified by all Member States at national level to ensure full entry into force, as only this would allow to fully reap all the benefits of this agreement.",-,2024-01-16,20.

I remember the joy that was in my group, the EPP, the night CETA was passed here in the European Parliament, by the biggest vote in favour of a trade agreement ever at that time. And of course, subsequently it has had provisional application. However, I was disappointed, like my colleagues in Fine Gael in Ireland, and others as well, that the Supreme Court ruled the ratification of it was unconstitutional, according to the Irish Constitution. But thankfully, it doesn’t require a referendum. I think an amendment to the Arbitration Act of 2010 will do the business, but of course, it has provisional application. There has been 30 % growth in trade between Ireland and Canada in the last number of years, as the rapporteur pointed out, creating 75 000 jobs across Europe. In fairness to the Canadians, Ireland and the other nine countries that haven’t ratified it should ratify it as quickly as possible – because Canada is a great country and it welcomed and gave jobs to an awful lot of Europeans at the time of the recession here when they couldn’t get jobs in Europe.",PPE,2024-01-16,20.

Adina-Ioana Vălean,"Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission would like first to thank Parliament, and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Berendsen, for this important report. We fully share the view that we need to support and improve the competitiveness, resilience and twin green and digital transition of EU ports and of the whole EU transport sector. This will allow the sector to grow in a way that is sustainable, both in social and environmental terms. We highlighted from the very beginning of this mandate, these priorities, in our strategy for smart and sustainable mobility, in which we lay the ground for the future strategic development of the entire transport system, including the ports. The strategy confirms that ports, as transport and logistic hubs, are key for our internal and international connectivity, for military purposes, for our economy, for reducing the CO2 emissions and pollution from transport. In line with the requirements in the Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Regulation, ports will provide clean fuels and electricity to ships. They will also contribute to the energy transition by becoming sustainable energy hubs – for example for offshore wind, for the production and import of hydrogen, for carbon capture and storage. This is why, at the request of the European Parliament, the Commission launched a pilot project – the Port Electricity Commercial Model – to be finalised in the first half of this year. The project has already identified several clean energy business models that reduce emissions from port operations, including onshore power supply. These models, which could be replicated across the EU, are primarily reliant on increased electrification. The European economy benefits from the international trade and foreign investments that ports attract, and which help create jobs and growth. European companies are, for example, among the world leaders in maritime transport and logistics. However, we need to ensure that investments from third countries do not lead to strategic dependencies and do not pose risks to European security and public order. The existing Foreign Direct Investment Screening Regulation already equips EU with a framework and common criteria to identify and assess risks linked to the foreign acquisition or control of strategic assets, including in transport, energy and communication infrastructures. Looking back on the last three years of implementation of FDI screening, the Commission was notified of more than 1 200 such cases by Member State authorities, with some also concerning transactions linked to critical infrastructure. At the same time, it is concerning that not all Member States have a national mechanism in place. Building on these experiences, the Commission will propose a revision of the FDI Screening Regulation. We look forward to work with the legislators to ensure that the EU rules for FDI screening remain fit for purpose and allow for a better and more consistent identification and mitigation of risks to security or public order for certain foreign investments. The Economic Security Strategy also reiterates the Commission’s call to all Member States which have not yet implemented national FDI screening mechanisms, to do so without further delay. The main objective of the revision will be to ensure that all Member States screen foreign acquisition of EU companies active in sensitive sectors, and improve the functioning of the current screening mechanism between Member States and the Commission. The revision of the Ten-T Regulation, agreed by the co-legislators in December last year, gives increased importance to maritime transport and ports by creating a European maritime space, the maritime dimension of the Ten-T. Ports’ more prominent role in the energy transition is also reflected in the addition of a number of ports to the Ten-T network. However, let us also acknowledge that attaining our ambitious objectives of the 24 ports will require significant investment in the coming years. The revision also includes a provision on the control of foreign investment in transport infrastructure, and notably on the construction of transport infrastructure by third country companies. The political agreement requires Member States to make all possible efforts to ensure that Ten-T infrastructure is protected against those threats. They must assess the potential risks arising from third-country participation or contributions to a project of common interest, and take appropriate countermeasures. Their assessment should in particular focus on the supply for the building, operation and maintenance of infrastructure, as well as access to sensitive information, including personal data. Assessments must also address third-country capabilities to control such information in conjunction with the building, operation and maintenance of the infrastructure. Together with other instruments, the examples that I have mentioned today show how we have taken action to strengthen the control of foreign influence on the European economy, including imports, and to bolster our resilience. The Commission has recognised the need to ensure the resilience of ports to the threat posed also by organised crime and drug trafficking, through October’s EU roadmap to fight drug trafficking and organised crime within the EU Port Alliance. The priorities of the roadmap include closer cooperation between customs authorities, law enforcement, public and private actors in ports, which will increase the resilience of ports against criminal infiltration. I am pleased to announce that a launch event of the public-private partnership with ports will be held on the 24 January in Antwerp. This will be the occasion to kick off the work of this important initiative, with the aim of building a level playing field against criminal infiltration in ports. The Commission remains open to considering options for further action if they are balanced, respect international obligations and agreements and can bring clear added value to our existing strategies and tools. However, any such initiatives would be for the next Commission to decide and would require thorough preparation, including stakeholder consultation and possible impact assessment.",-,2024-01-16,19.

Seán Kelly,"Mr President, firstly, thanks to my colleague Tom for doing great work in this area. Ports are absolutely vital for our economy, in terms of trade but, as he pointed out, especially for a decarbonised economy where we’re going to have a huge amount of offshore wind, and we need to develop our ports. But he is absolutely right: we need to ensure that we control and own our ports, and this is not the case in many places at the moment. That’s certainly something that has to be tackled and done, as he said, collectively in Europe, rather than individual ports trying to deal with it. I’m not aware of any ownership of ports in Ireland, but ports like Foynes, Bantry, Cork, Waterford, Rosslare have huge potential to both help the local communities, but especially to ensure that we can avail of the massive wind potential both in the Celtic Sea and in the Atlantic Ocean. So developing the infrastructure ports has to happen as quickly as possible. (End of catch-the-eye-procedure)",PPE,2024-01-16,19.

Adina-Ioana Vălean,"Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, today I do not want to just express our deep concern about the situation in Ecuador, but, above all, to express our solidarity with the people of Ecuador and our firm condemnation of the violence and criminal attacks carried out by armed groups in Ecuador. On 10 January 2024, gangs rioted in prisons, attacked security forces and invaded a live TV news broadcast. Violence was concentrated in Guayaquil, one of the major Latin American ports in the Pacific and an important export hub for drugs, where at least eight people were killed, as gunmen looted businesses and entered public buildings, including five hospitals. Coordinated uprisings took place in several penitentiaries, resulting in 141 members of prison staff being held hostage and in a mass outbreak of prisoners. As the country plunged into violence, President Daniel Noboa, declared a state of internal armed conflict. This allows him to widely mobilise the armed forces in the fight against organised crime. He designated 22 criminal groups as terrorist organisations, and instructed the armed forces and police to fight them. The National Assembly approved the decree by unanimity in a display of unity and support to the government. On 8 January 2024, President Noboa had already declared a state of emergency after one of Ecuador’s most wanted criminals escaped from prison. José Adolfo Macías Villamar, also known by the alias ‘Fito’, the founder and convicted leader of the ‘Los Choneros’ gang, vanished from his cell in Guayaquil on 7 January 2024 just before being transferred to a maximum security facility. Since then, 329 people have been arrested. Ecuador has witnessed states of emergency before due to the growing influence of gangs involved in drug trafficking, prison control, institutional corruption and the expansion into new criminal enterprises. However, President Noboa’s declaration of armed conflict with gangs is unprecedented in the country’s history. The EU supports Ecuador and its Government and democratic institutions in their efforts to restore public order, defend the rule of law, protect human rights and guarantee citizens’ security. Organised crime poses a direct threat to the resilience of public institutions and to democracy, prosperity and social cohesion of Ecuador. It must not be allowed to prevail. The EU categorically condemns this wave of violence. We reiterate our solidarity with Ecuador, its Government and its people, and express solidarity with the victims. We will work with Ecuador to strengthen our cooperation, financial assistance and collaboration with European law enforcement and investigation agencies to reinforce Ecuador’s ability to fight against transnational organised crime. The fight is not just a national issue, it is an international challenge that impacts directly on the EU and our societies and requires coordinated efforts on a global scale, from the countries of origin to those of transit and final destination of drugs and illegal benefits, including tax havens. The transnational nature of these crimes and these criminal networks demands that we all, including us in Europe, pool resources, intelligence and expertise to fight and eradicate them. Drug trafficking and organised crime linked to it are a threat to all societies, their prosperity, security and democracy. Europe needs to reinforce its cooperation with partners in the fight against drug trafficking in Ecuador and elsewhere. Ecuador may seem very far away from Europe, but in today’s interconnected world, we need to pool efforts and resources to defend our societies and democracies against organised crime. Honourable Members, the EU started to strengthen its cooperation with Ecuador in security matters, including the fight against transnational organised crime, years ago. This includes both policy dialogue and concrete cooperation assistance. In 2023, the EU signed a memorandum of understanding with Ecuador that will allow us to deepen cooperation on various policy areas, including on security. Last autumn, Europol signed a working agreement with the Ministry of the Interior of Ecuador, which will strengthen real—time cooperation. In February 2023, Commissioner Johansson visited Ecuador with the Belgian Minister of the Interior, Annelies Verlinden. They met with the President and several ministers, Foreign Affairs, Interior and Defence, and they visited the Port of Contecon in Guayaquil. The visit reaffirmed the EU’s commitment to support the security sector in Ecuador through our regional programmes EL PAcCTO, COPOLAD EUROFRONT and SEACOP. Specific cooperation activities, including emergency support for prison security and assistance for port security in Guayaquil, were initiated in 2023. These are just recent examples. In addition, the negotiations of the EU agreement with Ecuador on the exchange of data with Europol, which will bring operational cooperation to the next level, are ongoing. However, we must do more, and that is why we plan to mobilise new funds for 2024 to build up state and community resilience in some of the most affected areas of the country. I will stop here. I am looking forward to your remarks.",-,2024-01-16,18.

Ylva Johansson,"Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for the opportunity to open this debate on fighting the resurgence of neo-fascism. Let us remember Europe is still the beacon on democratic standards globally. But the world is ever more volatile. There are multiple conflicts, and there are many foreign actors who have an interest in eroding our democratic standards. There are also actors in the Member States who are attracted to the idea of a strong man approach to power, rejecting not just the international order, but rejecting also the domestic rule of law, rejecting the principles of liberal democracy. These actors are thankfully still the exception. But even on the margins, the activities from neo-fascist groups can bring great risk. So I come with a clear message: when it comes to fighting neo-fascism, it is essential that we act quickly and decisively, and it is essential that we act together because democracies die when democrats fail to act. Let us remember what neo-fascism is. It is not a challenge in a democratic system, it is a challenge to the democratic system – and that challenge comes with a corrosive effect on acceptable discourse, on media freedom, on rule of law. It is a rust that sets in. It goes slowly until it goes quick, and then it is too late. The remedy is quick and regular action until the threat recedes. So I was heartened to see the protest in Berlin and Potsdam last weekend, and heartened to see Chancellor Schulz and Foreign Minister Baerbock among their number. Thousands took to the streets in defence of democracy, against fascism and racism, and specifically against the revelation that an extreme right meeting had taken place in Potsdam last November. But this is not the only recent instance, of overt neo-fascism. Again, only last week, a crowd gave a well-drilled fascist salute at a rally in Rome. Italy’s foreign minister has rightly condemned this episode. These incidents are individually troubling in their scale, but they are also troubling in their connections. There is evidence that through online communication, invitations and attendance, there is growing participation of neo-fascist groups across Member State lines – a European nation, a Europeanisation of anti-democratic forces. This makes the rise in neo-fascist incidents a European problem. The Commission has put the fight against hate crime at the top of the agenda. Article Two of the Treaty and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights is clear: hate speech and hate crime are incompatible with the values of the European Union and fundamental rights. On 6 December last year, the Commission, under the guidance of Vice-Presidents Jourova and Schinas and Commissioner Reynders and Dalli, published the communication on ‘No Place for Hate’. This proposed the following actions: more money towards protecting people and the places in which they worship; a new code of conduct on countering illegal hate speech online; upgrading our anti-racist EU anti-racism, anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim hatred coordinators as designated envoys. In addition, our Radicalisation Awareness Network saw very early the need to invest in work against the risk of right-wing extremism. It is a daily fight that requires the mobilisation of all resources. We need to do more to protect democracy. In June this year, millions of Europeans will vote in the European Parliament elections. There is no greater celebration of our liberal, democratic and European system – and no greater compliment to that system than the prediction of another increase in turnout, a sign that a healthy democratic pulse beats in the EU. But we have to make sure that those who vote do so on the basis of information and not disinformation, because this information is becoming the fast lane to fascism. To fight the threat of disinformation in November 2021, the Commission presented its proposal on the transparency and targeting of political advertising. This was a part of its Democracy and Integrity of Elections package. The proposed regulation will introduce a high standard of transparency for political advertising services in the Union. It strengthens accountability by empowering citizens and interested entities in the democratic process, and supports national authorities in performing their oversight tasks. It deters the misuse of political advertising, including foreign interference. I am again heartened by the actions of the Parliament and Council who reached political agreement on this proposal. As you know, honourable Members, this mandate has not been an easy one. The challenge of the pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the cost of living crisis across the European Union – all these have tested people across Europe. It has led to understandable frustration and even alienation. Our job is to address those frustrations with well-thought-out policies and to make sure that the frustration is not exploited, it is not cultivated and amplified and eventually distorted and weaponised expressly to create divisions in our societies. This is where the risk of neo-fascism and the reality of foreign interference intersect. We need to act fast when we see a familiar threat, even if it wears a new mask. We know it as we see it and we will oppose it.",-,2024-01-16,"17.

Maroš Šefčovič,"Mr President, honourable Members, first and foremost, I would like to thank you for the good debate on these two very important reports, which confirm how high on the priority list this is of this House and how the honourable Members are looking at the important involvement of national parliaments in EU decision making and ensuring citizenship rights. The Commission, as I stated in my introductory remarks – and I think after this debate it was clearly reconfirmed, as this is very important for you, honourable Members – we clearly stand ready to strengthen the dialogue with the national parliaments through the established channels of communication, and also to improve the cooperation to facilitate the input of the national parliaments and to get feedback from them on the Commission’s political and legislative initiatives. I realise that many of you intervened on the perceived short timeframe of eight weeks for subsidiarity scrutiny which, as you know, is clearly stated in the Annex to the Treaties. But I would like to reassure you that when it comes to this eight-week subsidiarity scrutiny deadline, we have been showing our flexibility, especially when it comes to excluding both winter and summer breaks. We have also been showing flexibility during the difficult COVID times and we have always been in close contact with the national parliaments to make sure that we would provide them with additional information when we are coming with the concrete initiatives, and we have been inviting them to comment on our proposals early on, including on the Commission’s work programme. I can assure you that if you look at the statistics and the detailed answers we are providing to the national parliaments, which I am signing every single day, that this dialogue between the national parliaments and the Commission is indeed very, very lively. I also would like to thank all the honourable Members for their interventions on the important topic of EU citizenship, and I really would like to reiterate that it is crucial for us that we ensure that all EU citizens are fully aware of their citizenship rights and can fully benefit from them. The citizenship package that was presented is already an important step in that regard, but we are, of course, committed in the Commission to ensuring that it would continue to build on the further development of EU citizenship, and to work closely with you. I really would like also to thank the honourable Mr López Aguilar for his ideas, because, of course, citizenship has wider meaning that just the legal status – all the references to education, culture, transferability of rights are very important if you are living in a united European Union, and it is our common duty to make sure that we will make it as smooth and as efficient as possible for our citizens.",-,2024-01-16,16.

Jacek Saryusz-Wolski,"Mr President, both reports on the implementation of the Treaty provisions, respectively, on national parliaments and on EU citizenship being discussed today, are a perfect example of how the European centralist mainstream is trying to take over the Member States’ competences and transfer them to the European level. The report on national parliaments puts forward excessive and detrimental proposals and is written from this centralist perspective, emphasising creating a European political sphere revolving around European political families, interfering in the affairs of the Member States. It does not adequately treat national parliaments as fully-fledged European political actors. It portrays them as secondary political actors subordinate to the European Parliament. It flatly rejects the red card procedure to repeal EU laws, as proposed during the works on the Treaty change by the European Conservatives and Reformers Group. This report advocates direct engagement of European political parties in campaigns, in campaigns for European elections and in referenda in Member States, thus neglecting the diversity and autonomy of the national political scenes. The ECR will vote against this report. The second report concerning EU citizenship is even more controversial, as it proposes to strip the Member States of their most fundamental and exclusive prerogatives. Let me remind you that EU citizenship is, according to the EU Treaties, closely linked and dependent on the nationality of Member States, and granting citizenship is an exclusive competence of Member States. There is – and should never be – no other way to obtain EU citizenship than by obtaining the nationality of a Member State and citizenship of a Member State, according to rules which are specific to each Member State and take into account their traditions and constitutional order. Granting EU citizenship to third country nationals without them obtaining citizenship of a Member State would go against the Treaty order.

Maroš Šefčovič,"Mr President, honourable Members, first and foremost, I would like to thank you for this opportunity to discuss this important report with you here today. And I would like to thank our two rapporteurs, Madame Pagazaurtundúa and Mr Rangel, and the members of the AFCO Committee for the high quality of these reports. The Commission believes in and fosters strong relations with national parliaments, who are important allies to deliver on citizens expectations and constructively shape the Union’s future. National parliaments and their members can foster engagement and a feeling among citizens of being represented in EU matters. This is crucial these days, when disinformation, propaganda and other threats to our democracies are on the rise. The Commission acknowledges the important contribution that national parliaments can make to creating a European public sphere, as highlighted in the European Parliament’s report. The exchange with national parliaments, in building coalitions for the positive change is extremely important, as President von der Leyen underlined in her contribution the COSAC plenary meeting in Prague in 2022. Therefore, the Commission very much appreciates the active engagement of national parliaments beyond the subsidiarity control. We value the suggestions we receive on our initiatives in the framework of our lively political dialogue. The hundreds of such opinions each year show that national parliaments see these also as an important channel to make their voices heard on substance. The Commission encourages national parliaments to engage earlier in the process by providing forward-looking political input, such as on the annual Commission work programme and using own-initiative opinions to tell us about future initiatives that they deem necessary. I am sure that our political dialogue with the national parliaments, through the established channels and generally interparliamentary cooperation, still bears great potential for addressing current and future challenges. When it comes to EU citizenship, I would like to underline that the Commission is committed to continuing to improve the exercise of EU citizenship rights. Indeed, 30 years ago, the introduction of EU citizenship fundamentally changed the relationship between the EU and its citizens. Rights and opportunities that come with this status have become part of our lives. When we travel across the EU or outside the EU, or when we take part in the democratic process. In a Eurobarometer of December, 87 % of respondents agreed that they feel they are citizens of the European Union. At the same time, only half of the respondents indicated that they feel well informed about their rights. It is therefore crucial that all EU citizens, including those with special needs, like citizens with a disability, can exercise their rights effectively. We need to make EU citizenship rights more tangible for our citizens. It is in this light that we presented a citizenship package in December that builds on the European democracy action plan, and which was complemented by the defence of democracy package. The citizenship package includes the 2023 EU citizenship report, which extensively covers the progress made in enhancing and promoting citizenship rights and democratic participation. It also includes a proposal to amend the rules under the Consular Protection Directive to better protect EU citizens abroad, new guidance on the rights to free movement, reflecting evolutions in the case law of the European Court of Justice, a guide of a good electoral practices for citizens with a disability, so that these can exercise the electoral rights effectively, and the compendium of e-voting and other ICT practices to further support Member States in promoting the easy exercise of electoral rights. Finally, as a follow up to the Conference on the Future of Europe, the Commission also presented a guide to EU citizenship intended to make European citizenship more tangible for citizens, in particular for young people and people who recently acquired EU citizenship. This is particularly important in light of the next European Parliament elections, where we want to stimulate active citizenship and make sure that all EU citizens can make use of their rights, in particular their electoral rights. It will now be crucial to make best use of all these new tools. And we also look forward to continuing to work in partnership with you, to lay the groundwork for a reflection on further work on EU citizenship during the next Commission term of office, also on the basis of this report.",-,2024-01-16,16.

Emily O’Reilly,"Madam President, thank you very much, Members, for the attention you’ve paid to this report, and thank you again to Rapporteur Jahr for the great work he’s done in uniting the Parliament, which I gather from a couple of contributions, is a rare event, so thank you very much indeed. I’d like to thank Executive Vice-President Šefčovič for his comments on the special report. Statistics can go so far. We acknowledge fully that the Commission is very good at the initial stage in terms of sticking to deadlines and so on. We’re talking about the appeal stage and very often cases that may be complex, but sometimes they’re not so complex, they’re simply a little bit sensitive for whatever reason. I acknowledge that sometimes cases are complex. You may have to liaise with other Member States or with other institutions or individuals in relation to it. They can be legally complex and all of that. But the deadlines are the deadlines, and if the deadlines are insufficient, then perhaps Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 should be changed in order to extend the deadlines, because, as I pointed out, citizens have to respect deadlines. So we get complaints from people who may have applied for a job through EPSO, who may have applied for a grant. They might be a day late, but it doesn’t matter: they’re not getting that job and they’re not getting that opportunity to apply for that job, and they’re not going to get the opportunity to have that grant. So I think that has to be that has to be recognised. But I’m very glad that the Executive Vice-President of the Commission has said that they will look carefully at the report, and I hope that you do, because, as you pointed out, it’s very rare that we do make a report to Parliament. We don’t do it on a whim. We do it when we’ve tried everything else and nothing has worked, and that’s why we seek your support. And so thank you again for the comments that you have made. MEP Angel, again, I was pleased with what you had to say in relation to the European Parliament Bureau and the efforts you’re making in relation to increasing transparency. Transparency is not an end in itself; transparency is a gateway to accountability, so we very much look forward to seeing the results of that. Ms Toomb, emphasising the relevance of the special report which I have just alluded to. Ms Auken, Council transparency, we’ve spoken about that, and a lot of the work that we have done has been to make the work of that institution which makes decisions so critically important to every European citizen, especially now when the pace of events can be overwhelming for people – to make that work and more transparent without damaging interests that need to be protected. The issue of the vaccines came up, MEP Złotowski and MEP Joron, specifically in relation to the case that we did – text messages. I understand that the ECJ is dealing with that issue perhaps this year, so that should illuminate that particular matter further and give answers to questions that people still have. Ms Ždanoka, you noted indeed the fact that it’s rare that the Parliament comes together in relation to any particular issue. MEP Polčák, the EIB environmental information – thank you for alluding to those particular cases. Ms Maestre, the need to avoid citizen scepticism and that is really critical because we see how citizen scepticism can be weaponised by bad actors to bad ends, and that is really, really important. The Anti-Corruption Directive, Ms Strugariu, I know you’re working very hard on that, and you mentioned two areas, what you and I call soft corruption, conflicts of interest, revolving doors, very very important in relation to inappropriate influencing of the Parliament and the administration more generally. Ms Metz, yes, the animal cages issue in relation to the ECI. We are dealing with that as a complaint that you gave to us, and we will keep you and everybody updated on that. Vaccine procurement, MEP Fragkos, I’ve already alluded to that. Thank you, MEP Saliba, for the positive comments on our work. The Recovery and Resilience Fund was also mentioned. MEP Kelly, go raibh míle maith agat for your lovely comments on behalf of your colleagues. I really, really appreciate it. You mentioned that we have limited resources, but I refer to our office as a small office with a big mandate, and I put great emphasis on being resilient and using the resources that we have to the best of our ability. I want to thank all of my colleagues who do that so well and make me look good. MEP López Aguilar, thank you very much indeed for for your comments. You mentioned the complementary role of the ECJ and ombudsprudence. And I think those, those points were, were very well made. Thank you very much indeed. Have a lovely evening and a very happy new year to you all.",-,2024-01-16,15.

Maroš Šefčovič,"Madam President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, Madam O’Reilly, our Ombudsman. First and foremost, I would like to thank all of you for your interventions, but also for what was clearly your overwhelming support for the work of the Ombudsman and her team. I would like to underline that for the Commission, good administration is not only a concept; we see it as a right enshrined in the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The demands and the needs of EU citizens, businesses and associations for transparent, accessible and efficient EU institutions based on the principles of non-discrimination, impartiality, objectivity and fairness are therefore legitimate, reasonable and valid. In this particular case, we have total agreement with most of the interventions here this evening. That is why the cooperation between the European Ombudsman and the EU institution is of key importance. I would also like to thank once again Madam O’Reilly, her team, our rapporteur and the rapporteurs from the different groups for their work and good cooperation with the Commission. I congratulate the Ombudsman for the great support of this House. Most of the interventions have been focused on the issue of the special report on delays in dealing with access to documents requests. If you would allow me to add just a few pieces of information in this regard: this is the first time since 2012 that the Ombudsman issues a special report concerning the Commission. We have, of course, taken note of the special report which was submitted to the European Parliament in September of last year, and we stand ready to engage in the discussion with the European Parliament before the relevant committee on this matter and explain what it does to enhance the handling of the request for public access to documents. The matter, I would like to assure you, is of great importance for the Commission and the EU institutions committed to transparency. At this point, the Commission wishes to reiterate that the vast majority of the requests for access to documents submitted to the Commission are handled in a timely manner. The issue of delays mainly concerned requests from applicants to review the initial replies of the institution, the so-called confirmatory applications. This only represents approximately 4.4% of all requests received by the Commission. The Commission is already implementing most of the suggestions of the European Ombudsman, so I believe that this figure will be further improved. In particular, we have recently decided to allocate more resources to dealing with confirmatory applications. To conclude, I would just like to highlight one more very important factor that, if you are talking about handling of the requests for public access to documents, it’s important to highlight that the Commission is able, in general, to process requests for access to documents within the time limits prescribed. In 2021, the average duration in working days for the Commission to take the decision on an initial request for public access was 20 days – not 30, but 20 days. Of course, if you are talking about the confirmatory requests, here very often what happens is that this is a subsequent request coming from the applicants who are not fully satisfied with the first response. This is an issue where we are talking about 355 requests out of 8420 in 2021, or 418 out of 7410 in 2022. Therefore, the conclusion that this is a systemic problem that affects the handling of requests for public access in general is something which we would like to discuss with Madam Ombudsman, but also in the discussions we will have in the relevant committee. The reason why it takes longer, and this will be my last point, is that the processing of this request is affected by the fact that they are very often particularly complex due to their legal and technical nature. We not only have to look at the legality of the request, but we also have to do thorough research and make sure that we respect the legal requirements resulting from other EU acts, as well as the integration of the fast-evolving case-law of the EU Court of Justice on this matter. To conclude, I just would like to reiterate that we are ready to work constructively with Madam O’Reilly and her team, as well as with the honourable Members of this Parliament, to further improve the process and to make sure that our citizens will get all the necessary information in a transparent and speedy manner.",-,2024-01-16,15.

Seán Kelly,"A Uachtaráin, firstly, as an Irish person, I am very pleased and proud of the work of Ombudsman O’Reilly. For a number of years now, she’s been doing her job in a very impartial, professional manner with – as has been admitted – limited resources and, of course, as has been pointed out, she has worked very closely with the European Parliament, especially the Petitions Committee. Both the Petitions Committee and the Ombudsman are probably one of the only ways we can get recourse for difficulties and highlight malpractices, especially in relation to European institutions, where the Ombudsman is concerned. And I think she did that fearlessly. The fact that she annoyed some people during her time in office over the last number of years, that was probably a compliment because it showed that she was objective, she was fearless and she did a very good job. On behalf, I think, of Irish MEPs and the Irish public in general, we’re very proud of her and wish her well. Go raibh maith agat, Emily.",PPE,2024-01-16,15.

Ramona Strugariu,"Madam President, I would like to congratulate Ms O’Reilly and her office for the crucial work they’re doing in addressing our citizens’ concerns – a European administration that is responsive to their needs is key to protecting their rights. It was a real pleasure and an honour to work together. The European Ombudsman was and is our constant ally in defending the citizens. The report that we are about to adopt offers many examples of the way in which we often join forces. There is one aspect I would like to highlight, also in my capacity as rapporteur of the European Parliament for the Anti-corruption Directive, the fight against corruption. Corruption is, as you so aptly put it, Ms O’Reilly, during the launch event of the EU Anti-Corruption network that we attended together, a kind of poison in the body politic. It is vital also to address those insidious forms of poison which are conflicts of interest, revolving doors and lobbying. We appreciate your work in this respect. We appreciate your criticism, as it pushes us every time to do more, to fight this poison and defend our citizens’ rights.",Renew,2024-01-16,15.

Remember us.’ Those words of the late Doctor Mahmoud Abu Nugaila were repeated by Irish lawyer, Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh, before the International Court of Justice last week. In Northern Ireland, 3 500 people died over the 30 years of our conflict. In Gaza, that number have died in a little over the last two weeks. So many innocent civilians; most are women and children. Netanyahu must go. He, and his government, must pay the price for breaching international law. The relentless bombing is preventing precious aid and medical supplies from getting into Gaza. Children are being operated on without anaesthesia. It is time for concrete EU actions, including economic sanctions and banning the sale of Israeli settlement goods.

Janez Lenarčič,"Madam President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, on behalf of High Representative Borrell, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Ms Alametsä, and all those Members who have actively contributed to the report on EU-India relations. The European Union wants to continue deepening its strategic partnership with India. India is now the most populated country in the world and has significant economic potential. India’s geopolitical positioning and domestic policy choices, particularly on climate and environmental issues, have implications for the Indo-Pacific region, and indeed for the rest of the world. It is in the context of India’s steady rise and regional and global power dynamics that we should assess the strategic partnership between the EU and India. Broadly speaking, EU relations with India are expanding and enjoying positive momentum. As the rapporteur points out, our strategic partnership with India is guided by a bilateral political framework – the Roadmap to 2025 – which guides joint action in many policy areas to further strengthen our relationship. The implementation of the Roadmap is continuously monitored and well advanced. The EU and India have a common interest in each other’s security, prosperity and sustainable development, and together can contribute to a safer, cleaner and more stable world. Last year, we witnessed the magnitude and success of India’s G20 presidency, and we recognise India’s efforts to put the priorities and concerns of developing countries high on the agenda. Let me continue by highlighting some recent achievements of our deepening partnership. The relaunch of negotiations for an EU free trade agreement with India was a momentous development, back in 2022. There have now been six rounds of talks, with both sides prioritising a comprehensive and ambitious trade agreement as the outcome. The EU and India also established a ministerial-level Trade and Technology Council, TTC, in May 2023, in order to give high-level political steering to our cooperation in strategic issues at the nexus of trade, trusted technology and security. We expect to hold the next meeting soon. In 2021, the EU and India adopted a connectivity partnership and together with the EU’s Global Gateway Strategy and the European Investment Bank, we are making progress in key sectors such as energy, urbanisation, digitalisation and transport. In addition, the EU is strengthening its cooperation with India on security and defence with regular thematic dialogues, joint naval exercises and closer cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. Honourable Members, while our relations with India are experiencing an overall positive trajectory, we are conscious of the reports about the deteriorating human rights situation and shrinking civil society space, which are addressed at length in your report. I would like to reassure you that human rights are indispensable elements in EU foreign policy towards all our partners, India being no exception. In this context, let me highlight that the EU is the only external partner with whom India has a dedicated human rights dialogue. We attach great importance to this dialogue and the ability to have genuine discussions with India as strategic partners, even on sensitive issues like this one. In conclusion, with the world facing major geopolitical challenges, India remains a crucial strategic partner for the EU. Our ability to strategically navigate the 21st century and work together on key priorities will bring great benefits to both Europe and India, and to the rest of the world.",-,2024-01-16,13.

Seán Kelly,"A Uachtaráin, the atrocities committed on 7 October by Hamas against innocent civilians were entirely repugnant. But what we are seeing now has entered another stratosphere in terms of ordinary people – men, women and children – being killed, starved or left homeless. There have been many comments in this debate revolving around geopolitics and strategic interests. Such details and explanations are of little value when the reality is that a whole population is being punished for the actions of terrorists. The military campaign in Gaza is among the deadliest and most destructive in recent history. Not much has been said about what kind of bombs and artillery are being used in Gaza. But the indiscriminate bombing, the devastation to the infrastructure and to the whole population is immense. I support the Irish Government’s efforts to intensify the pressure for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, and I call on everyone here present to do the same. I am against Hamas. I am against anti-Semitism, but I will always stand up for the innocent. Israel has the right to exist and defend itself. It has the right to get its hostages home safe. But innocent Palestinians have the right to life – not just to live, but to life. We need a ceasefire, and we need it now.

Jaak Madison,"Mr President, dear colleagues, it is not a very nice debate, and of course the situation is not even nicer either. First of all, Europe, of course, has supported Ukraine, but as already mentioned, it hasn’t been sufficient, and it has been too little and too late. What was also mentioned before already – and it was absolutely correct – our industries, defence industries, are very slowly increasing, and that’s the huge problem. The European economies are just working and continuing as under normal times. On the Russian economy, they are working 24/7 in their war time zone. The second problem is that we’ve been afraid of the escalation. Of course, all of us have to be afraid of escalation. Nobody wants to see war in the Baltic states or in Poland or in Moldova. But the problem is that the real escalation will be if Ukraine will fall. That will be the real escalation for the future – to have a new war in three, four or five years. The second thing: last week we had the honour to welcome Mr Zelenskyy in Tallinn, and he said very clearly they need men. They need more men, because thousands of men have died, also from the Ukrainian side. But in Europe, we have almost 800 000 Ukrainian men who have illegally broken the Ukrainian laws, escaped from Ukraine, as cowards. We need to help Ukraine with those men, and also with the military aid, that they will not die in Ukraine; that they will fight for Ukraine and they will win this war.",ID,2024-01-16,4.

Il a permis de montrer une nouvelle fois aussi à quel point l’Ukraine fait partie de la famille européenne. La guerre d’agression menée par la Russie est également une menace pour nos valeurs, pour notre souveraineté, pour notre sécurité. Il est donc de notre devoir de poursuivre et d’accroître notre soutien, y compris évidemment le soutien militaire aussi longtemps, oui, aussi longtemps qu’il le faudra. Dire le contraire relève de l’inconscience. C’est ignorer les folles ambitions expansionnistes de Vladimir Poutine qui, par la voix de son ministre des affaires étrangères, a déjà fait savoir qu’il ne s’arrêterait pas à l’Ukraine. D’autres pays sont en danger. Nous sommes en danger. Il faut nous rappeler que Kiev n’est qu’à 1 600 kilomètres de Strasbourg. Comme je l’ai dit dans mon introduction, et je suis heureuse d’entendre ce point de vue aussi partagé par la majorité de cette assemblée, nous devons donc continuer à soutenir les efforts en faveur d’une paix juste et durable. Personne ne souhaite plus la paix aujourd’hui que les Ukrainiens. Nous soutenons évidemment pleinement le plan en dix points, le plan de paix présenté par le président Zelensky, qui est la seule proposition valable pour l’instant. And I would like, also, to seize this opportunity to remind you of what our wartime approach is towards Russia. It is a clear approach, based on unity and one we will sustain. We need to continue to isolate Russia internationally. We need to limit its ability to finance its war through sanctions. We need to ensure accountability for the violations of international law and war crimes committed in Ukraine. We need to enhance our resilience, in particular our energy security and critical infrastructure, and we need to support our neighbours and partners globally also to address the global consequences of war. And finally, we need to support the civil society, human rights defenders and independent media inside and outside Russia. As far as deliveries of ammunition to Ukraine are concerned, I hear some Members voicing concerns, saying that we need to do more and faster, and indeed, you are totally right: we need to do better. It is a work in progress. We take it very seriously. We are making a lot of efforts according to our capacities that, indeed, need to be urgently improved. I want to conclude by saying that you can count on the presidency to do its utmost to push this wartime approach further in the Council and to work with the Member States to ramp up production and deliveries. As Minister of Foreign Affairs, I will, of course, push for this within the Foreign Affairs Council as well, and we will do our utmost to reach these goals.",-,2024-01-16,4.

We have to ensure that the battlefield goods are not exported from the European Union to Russia, despite sanctions. Circumventions of sanctions must stop. Customs statistics show that EU countries’ exports to central Asian countries grew by 80% in a year. Shocking headlines in the media talk about the goods which look like they are destined for central Asia, but they end up in Russia.

Guy Verhofstadt,"Mr President, first of all I have to tell you that I have had enough of these debates here where the Commission and the Council comes here and says ‘as long as it takes, we are going to support Ukraine’, but we don’t really support Ukraine on military. The reality, to give only one example, is artillery shells. The Russians have 3 million a year – 2 million that they produced themselves and 1 million that they received from North Korea. And we are not capable – you say ‘soon’, but when is soon? – even to produce 1 million of these shells in a year. That’s the reality on the ground. The F-16s are not ready, it will take six months! Long range missiles – there is a refusal by the German Chancellor to give them for the moment. On air defence, Patriots – there are not enough delivered. And the reason why? There is one simple reason, and that is there is no European Defence Community, no government procurement. That’s the real disaster of Europe. That is what I hope now – and, President, you’re going to decide on 1 February – now, instead of giving in to Orban, make a serious military package for Ukraine.

The best example is the possible MFF revisions that are still pending. Therefore, it’s high time to start implementing the conclusions from the Conference on the Future of Europe, to improve our structure and make it more efficient. Ukrainians are fighting daily to defend their country. Their success is of exceptional importance for the European Union, too, as the defence of Ukraine essentially defines the security and perspective of the entire European project.

While it is clear that the EU has already supported Ukraine beyond anyone’s expectations, today, every day of our delay costs Ukrainian blood. A Ukrainian defeat would cost infinitely more than the money needed for a Ukrainian victory. Orbán is blocking EUR 50 billion for Ukraine. The EU as a whole has spent for Ukraine only 0.075% of GDP per year so far. This war is about whether democracies are even capable of taking the necessary decisions and defending themselves. The fate of future generations is at stake. We are much stronger than the morally rotten Putin regime. To win the long lasting, sustainable peace, we need political will and military support for Ukraine.

Mick Wallace,"Mr President, this is a war that could have been prevented, a war that could have been stopped as early as April 2022. But we didn’t want peace. We wanted war. We wanted to promote a US-NATO proxy war in the effort to damage Russia. We spent billions of EU taxpayers’ money fuelling a war that wasn’t in our interest, and has helped to destroy Ukraine for no good reason. Ukraine wants to recruit a half a million more soldiers for the war. Over 17 000 have been caught and detained by security services while attempting to avoid the draft. Many more have escaped. Zelenskyy wants to lower the draft days from 27 to 25, as the average age of soldiers breaches 40. There are interviews in the US media where seasoned soldiers say that due to age, alcoholism or illness, less than half the new recruits have any ability or the will to fight. Yuriy Lutsenko, a former prosecutor general and the ex-head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, recently called for the government to tell the truth about the casualty numbers. He said Ukraine was currently losing 30 000 soldiers a month, and that half a million have been killed or seriously wounded since the beginning of the invasion. The Spiegel reported last week that Germany doesn’t even know where its arms are going once they’ve reached Ukraine. You want to keep military assistance commitments to Ukraine when you know it’s an unmitigated disaster and a bloodbath that you are fuelling.

Sven Mikser,"Mr President, dear colleagues, just to pick up from where my colleague ended: ensuring Ukraine will emerge victorious requires continuous, sustained flow of aid from the international coalition of democratic nations, including weapons and ammunition. Unfortunately, this is not the case today. In order to make sure that we will not lose focus and that our collective support for Ukraine’s war effort will not fall victim to our internal political gridlocks, we should make a firm, measurable commitment similar to NATO’s famous 2% threshold for defence spending. If the Euro-Atlantic community and all other like-minded nations committed to Ukraine’s ultimate victory over the aggressor would allocate, until the war has been won, just a modest 0.25% of their GDP for supporting Ukraine, it would yield approximately EUR 120 billion annually, more than enough to ensure that there are no unwanted disruptions in the ability of Ukrainian military to fight back the aggressor. Moreover, it would effectively thwart any Russian hopes of military victory over Ukraine and deliver a clear message to the Kremlin that we will stand by Ukraine until the aggressor has been decisively defeated.",S&D,2024-01-16,4.

Last year, Russia spent 6 % of its GDP for the war, Ukraine 25 %. EU military assistance for Ukraine was only 0.075 % of EU GDP. The US did a little bit better at 0.1 %. Assistance to Ukraine is very different by different countries. Lithuania and Estonia gave 1.4 % of GDP. Germany increased up to 0.5 %, but France’s assistance is only 0.02 %.

Petras Auštrevičius,"Mr President, Madam Minister, Commissioner, the fate of Ukraine as a state and of Ukrainians as a nation is being decided on the battlefield. Our ally Ukraine can only contain and defeat the aggressor if, among other things, it is given the necessary military support. It goes without saying that in order to defeat the terrorist state Russia, the amount of the Western military support must far exceed the increase in Russian military spending. Let us frankly admit that this has not yet happened. Our European commitment to Ukraine in terms of military aid must not only be met, but well exceeded. Only in this way will we be able to provide the necessary assistance to Ukraine and protect our countries from any possible Russian military provocation. I call on the EU Member States to honour the commitments they have made to Ukraine and its people. Ukraine has no choice but to fight for its survival, paying a high price in the lives of its people and other devastating losses. Peace in Ukraine can only be restored and secured with the support of its Western allies. Dear colleagues, insufficient military deliveries could lead to the defeat of Ukraine and, consequently, to the destruction of the Western security system.

Yet we are again at a defining moment. The fact is that Ukraine is at a critical point in the war, with lack of weapons and ammunition, as they refer to constantly. And I would like to say even to Michael Gahler, it is under the leadership of Chancellor Scholz that Germany is continuing to support Ukraine, but a number of Member States must deliver on their promises at this stage. The inability of the Council to agree on the financing to Ukraine is deeply concerning and disappointing, Minister, and this is a message I’d like to convey directly to you, and the possibility of the US withdrawing their support is at least disturbing. Ukrainians are fighting for their bare existence. Their victory prevents us from fighting ourselves against a rogue imperialist state of Putin that has no regard for the international law.

Maroš Šefčovič,"Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, the European Council decision to grant EU candidate status to Ukraine created a powerful reform dynamic despite the ongoing devastating war, with strong support from the people of Ukraine. The Ukrainian Government and Parliament demonstrated impressive resolve and resilience over the last year. In a short period of time, the country has confirmed its capacity to make progress in reforms aligning with the EU acquis, even during the war time. In addition, the decision in December by the European Council to open the negotiations provided the Ukrainian people with a morale boost and the hope for a brighter European future. In turn, it is our role and duty to not only continue but increase our support to Ukraine on all fronts, but especially on military assistance, as we witness the relentless attacks Ukraine faces by the Russian aggressor. The work the European Union and its Member States are currently undertaking on Europe’s defence, competitiveness and capacity will eventually provide Ukraine with necessary support among the other security commitments. In March 2023, EU Member States agreed on a three-track approach to deliver ammunition to Ukraine. Since then, the EU has progressed on this strategy to deliver one million rounds to Ukraine. The Commission has been contributing to this effort, focusing in particular on the ramping up of the industrial production capacity. Soon, the European industry will have a capacity to produce one million artillery shells a year. For other types of ground-to-ground ammunition, such as mortar shells, it has already a production capacity well in excess of one million. In support of ramping up ammunition and missile production, EU Member States agreed on a work programme to implement regulation on supporting ammunition production, which we know under the abbreviation ASAP, which will allocate EUR 500 million to support the investment project worth up to EUR 1.4 billion, thereby incentivising the ramp up of ammunition and missile production in the European Union. It will also help address bottlenecks throughout the supply chains of ammunition and missiles in the EU and Norway by supporting industry to rapidly adjust to new market trends and reduce dependencies. In addition, the EU is also intensifying its efforts to incentivise Member States to commonly procure the most critical and urgent defence products from the European defence industry. The instrument for the reinforcement of the European defence industry through common procurement (EDIRPA), which was adopted last October, will play an important role in this context.

Alexander De Croo,"Madam President, dear colleagues, thank you for for a rich debate and it shows that this is how democracy works – is that people have ideas and people have different ideas. Some of you did contribute with ideas; some of you did not. Let me answer a few of the questions that that have been asked. Je commencerai par Monsieur Lutgen. En effet, vous avez raison de mettre en avant le secteur de l’agriculture. Je ne l’ai pas mentionné dans mon discours, mais cela ne veut pas dire que ce n’est pas important. Et le côté agriculture, avec le rôle économique qu’elle joue – rallier l’industrie et l’agriculture, je pense que c’est le point fondamental. Je pense que trop souvent on a essayé d’opposer l’un à l’autre et je pense que c’est une faute de les opposer. Vous avez tout à fait raison: c’est un sujet important, et important aussi pour la présidence belge. Madam Pérez, you asked a question on social protection and the platform economy. And I think we have to find the right the right balance. The platform economy has positive points where it creates opportunities for people to enter into the labour market in a flexible way. Opportunities to learn certain skills from another perspective. Of course, social protection is crucial. Finding that balance, I think, we share that objective with you. Dear Hilde, Ms Vautmans, as we grow, we have to get better, and I think that is the right way of seeing it. It needs to be in parallel. As we know we have an ambitious agenda on that, we will be contributing with the permanent President of the European Council, of course, and working on that, we will play a role of being a facilitator, of bringing people together. But indeed, it is crucial, as the European Union that will respond to those expectations. Poll after poll, we see that our population expects more from the European Union, and that might not be something that some people in this audience like to hear. But the European population across the board expects more from us, and we need to respond to that expectation. Monsieur Lamberts, quand j’ai parlé de la pause pour bien regarder, je n’ai jamais dit une pause sur le Pacte vert. Jamais. Le Pacte vert est la priorité et on ne peut pas toucher à cette priorité. Mais je pense que, dans l’exécution de tous les différents paquets qu’on met en avant, il faut bien mettre la priorité sur les choses. Bien regarder quelle est la séquence à utiliser, je pense, aidera à réaliser le Pacte vert et aidera aussi à avoir le soutien de notre population européenne. Mijnheer Bourgeois, mijnheer Annemans, ik hoor u beiden hetzelfde vertellen. Ik moet zeggen, ik ben naar Straatsburg gekomen en ik dacht dat ik in Brussel gebleven was. (Geklap) Van beiden heb ik níéts gehoord over waar deze Europese Unie naartoe moet gaan. Blijkbaar hebben uw beide partijen geen mening over wat Europese politiek zou moeten betekenen. Nochtans lijkt het mij een zeer belangrijk beleidsdomein te zijn. Maar u heeft hier beiden de gelegenheid gehad en heeft niets verteld over welke richting het Europees debat uit zou moeten gaan. Dat is ontstellend, maar het geeft misschien een stuk transparantie aan de Belgen over waar uw prioriteit ligt. En uw prioriteit ligt duidelijk niet hier. Dat is jammer, maar het is een realiteit. As I said, there is a broad range of things that we will do in our presidency. Many of you have mentioned the fact that competitiveness is high on the agenda and the functioning of the internal market is a crucial one. The European reform agenda is one in which the priorities are ‘how do we finance, how do we make our decisions?’ The debate on fundamental rights and on the rule of law touches at the core of what we are as a European Union. I think, listening to some of you, it is more important than ever to defend that democracy where we are allowed to have different opinions and where we respect the fact that different opinions are at the core of democracy. I think that, in the world of today, it is good not to be alone. Are we happy to be a club of 27 that defend one another in a world that is more turbulent than ever? That is, for me, the conclusion: democracy, also in Europe, is working together. Working together is not always a beauty contest. Sometimes it is hard work. It is hard work, but that is what people expect from us. That is what people expect from democracies. It is hard work, but let us deliver on the expectations from our population. Let us make Europe a better place for future generations. That is our duty. That is what our presidency will work on.

Siegfried Mureşan,"Madam President, Prime Minister De Croo welcome back to the European Parliament. Obviously, Belgium takes over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union at a very important moment in time, specifically, also due to the European elections. Obviously, Belgium will have three main responsibilities, duties, opportunities during this presidency: firstly, to defend and promote whatever we have managed to do good in Europe over the course of the last five years, so that the citizens of Europe can make an informed decision when they go to the polls in June; secondly, to respond to crisis; and thirdly, to further develop the European Union. When I speak about responding to crises, we are seeing many farmers being concerned, being out in the streets in many Member States of the European Union. Prime Minister De Croo, we expect the Belgian Council Presidency to react to this, to put the concerns of the farmers on the agenda of the Council as a matter of priority. When it comes to further developing the Union, I think the Belgian Presidency has identified some correct priorities for the European Union, and I would like to encourage you to work a lot on further strengthening the competitiveness of the European economy. We started to do some good work with the Swedish Presidency on this topic. Improving the competitiveness of our economy means the economy can grow. We can create more jobs. We can secure the payments of salaries, of pensions, of social benefits. This is the core of what Europe is. So please work on competitiveness. Please be fast on revising the Multiannual Financial Framework at all levels in the Council. This needs to be done. Please count on the European Parliament.

Maroš Šefčovič,"Madam President, I promise I will be very brief. But, first and foremost, dear Prime Minister De Croo, dear Alexander; dear Minister, dear Hadja – we were together in several Councils; and of course, honourable Members of the European Parliament; it’s first time, glad to be back in this Chamber for the first plenary of 2024. I want to start by wishing all of you a Happy New Year, because, indeed, this will be a very demanding period for all of us, because the new year brings with it, of course, a new Presidency of the Council, and first, as the Prime Minister has just done, I also would like to thank everyone who worked so hard to make the outgoing Spanish Presidency a success. But now it’s the turn of Belgium to take this important responsibility at this very important moment in time. The Belgian Presidency will see the upcoming European elections in June, and this will help shape the future of our Union, and take place amidst extensive and numerous challenges, and the Prime Minister described all of them in a very eloquent manner. Before then, however, it is crucial that we maintain our efforts to deliver on all outstanding files which remain on the table, and the Commission stands ready to support the Belgian Presidency and all of you in making this happen, and showing Europeans that we live up to our promises and deliver the real-world results for their benefit. So, I’m very happy that the Belgian Presidency’s priorities closely align with ours, and I want to touch on a few of them this morning. We need to continue taking action to boost the competitiveness of our economy, including by finding an agreement on the Net Zero Industry Act, but also to explore all the possibilities which would make our Green Deal, our real growth strategy, and to look for every possible angle how to boost the competitiveness of Europe and the European economy. We also need to swiftly conclude work on the reform of the EU’s economic governance, so that the new rules enter into force before the European elections, and allow the Member States to use the new rules in their fiscal planning for 2025. In addition, the Commission trusts that the Belgian Presidency will ensure appropriate follow-up to the upcoming annual Single Market and Competitiveness Report and Scoreboard. I’m sure the reports by both distinguished gentlemen, Mr Letta and Mr Draghi, will contribute to this reflection. Our pursuit of a just green transition must stay on track. In the coming months, this will include finding agreement on the key pending climate and environmental files, such as CO2 emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles, carbon-removal certification, and ambient air quality, among others. We also look forward to discussions on the assessment of the 2040 climate target, which we will table in February, as well as a strategy in March on how to better protect Europe against the impact of climate change, such as droughts and floods. When it comes to reinforcing our social and health agenda, I am very pleased, and I would like to thank the Prime Minister and the Presidency for putting it so high on this agenda, and we are already looking forward to our discussions in La Hulpe on interinstitutional declaration on Social Europe, but also on the discussion, which will take place a few weeks later, and it will be the Social Partner Summit in Val Duchesse, which I am sure will help ensure that social partners will remain at the heart of our future. In addition, the Presidency’s leadership will be key in pushing forward measures to prevent medicine shortages, an issue that is so close to the hearts of our citizens. This includes establishing a critical-medicine alliance and advancing the reforms of EU pharmaceutical legislation. With political agreement being reached in December on the New Pact on Migration and Asylum, we look to the Belgian Presidency to finalise the remaining legislative work in this area swiftly, and focus on implementation. It is important that we conclude the trilogues on the Schengen Borders Code and the Long-Term Residents Directive, advancing on the anti-smuggling package, which would further strengthen our legislative framework. The Commission also welcomes the Belgian Presidency’s commitment to further work on rule-of-law initiatives, and look forward to the discussions on the Defence of Democracy package. To better protect the victims of violence – as it was again underscored by the Prime Minister a few minutes ago – we will look to reach an agreement on the proposed directive on combating violence against women and domestic violence. Finally, we will work with our partners around the world, not least in continuing our enduring and unprecedented support for Ukraine, and seek a long-term solution to the conflict in the Middle East. Honourable Members, dear Prime Minister, dear Minister, these remaining months of your current mandate will be extremely busy, but I am sure that together we can produce the results expected of us by our citizens.

Alexander De Croo,"Madam President, dear Roberta, ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues, first of all, I would like to express my gratitude to the European Parliament for all the work that has been done over the past years, but also express my expectation to do quite some work in the last months. We still have work to do and we can work together with you in the most fruitful way possible. Ladies and gentlemen, 2024 will be a crucial year. A lot is at stake for Europe. A lot is at stake for the West. A year where our democracies and our liberties will be put to the test, not only with the election for this House, but equally so for the US Congress, equally so with an election for the American presidency. If 2024 brings us ‘America first’ again, it will be, more than ever, ‘Europe on its own’. We should, as Europeans, not fear that prospect. We should embrace it. We should embrace it by putting Europe on a more solid footing: stronger, more sovereign, more self-reliant. A Europe that delivers and makes a difference in people’s lives, protecting them, strengthening the economy, preparing a common European future. The Belgian Presidency wants to contribute to this effort, and we are grateful that we can build on the efforts and the many successes of the Spanish Presidency that just finished. Ladies and gentleman, in spite of all the challenges we face, Europe is a good place to live, if not probably the best in the world. The euro, the internal market and social cohesion: these are the cornerstones of our prosperity. We managed to turn the page on COVID faster than many others in the world. We achieved unity and solidarity in the face of the Russian war of aggression against an innocent Ukraine, a solidarity we absolutely need to keep up with the Ukraine facility and continued military support. For America and for other allies, the support for Ukraine is a strategic question. It is a geopolitical consideration. For us Europeans, the support to Ukraine is existential. It goes to the heart of our security and our prosperity. Ladies and gentlemen, one of the biggest challenges ahead is keeping our European economy strong and vibrant. Europe cannot become an economic museum. If we want to remain that innovative, creative, capital-rich and productive continent, we will have to switch to a higher gear. The United States of America gave its industry a giant fiscal boost: a USD 1.2 trillion subsidy bazooka that is making even the biggest EU Member States flinch. On the other side, we see China strengthening its grip over world markets. The only way we Europeans would not get squeezed is to revive the spirit of the great Jacques Delors, opening up the markets of the future for European competition: energy, digital, artificial intelligence, defence and capital markets. The problem is Europe is strong on innovation but weak in scaling up those innovations. Our young entrepreneurs struggle today to bring their ideas to the market; they struggle finding risk capital and venture capital to grow their businesses and to conquer new markets. We need to go from ‘invented in Europe’ to ‘developed in Europe’, all the way to ‘made in Europe’. To do that, we need more than just a few pockets of capital in a handful of European cities. We need the whole of Europe – every corner of our continent – to turn into one big capital market accessible to all young entrepreneurs from Stockholm to Naples, from Dublin to Sofia. That is why the Belgian Presidency has asked former Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta to come with a report to give the European single market a new momentum. We need to make a similar shift when it comes to our industry to keep industrial investment strong, to keep industrial production here among us in Europe. For that, we need an Industrial Deal alongside the Green Deal. It is not only vital for our prosperity, but also crucial to win the fight against climate change. The climate policies of China and the United States contain an abundance of carrots for their industry, while we here in Europe all too often grab for the stick. By not merely fixing the climate goals, but also nailing down the way in which these goals need to be achieved, we are leaving too little room for our companies, too little room for innovation and for creativity. In order to prevail in the fight against climate change, we need a Europe with focus: to focus on bringing down greenhouse gas emissions; to support companies who develop and use these clean technologies; to become more technologically neutral in our policies. And let us not forget: to create the necessary social support for these climate policies by making green investments accessible to all, not just to the happy few. That is why our presidency wants to give a new impetus to our social agenda. On the initiative of the President of the European Commission, we bring together the social partners to discuss the future of social dialogue to confront the challenges that we face. To discuss how disruptive changes in our social and economic models, such as artificial intelligence, can be best addressed. This initiative goes hand in hand with the Belgian Presidency’s ambition to ensure a strong implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights as we prepare for the next institutional cycle. Mesdames et Messieurs, une Europe qui tient sa place dans le monde de demain signifie aussi une Europe qui prend ses responsabilités par rapport à ses voisins: les Balkans occidentaux, l’Ukraine, la Moldavie et la Géorgie. En attendant d’accueillir de nouveaux membres, ne restons pas inactifs. Pendant que les pays candidats se préparent à l’adhésion, nous ne pouvons pas rester les bras croisés. La Présidence belge s’efforcera de soutenir les pays candidats dans leur aspiration à rejoindre la famille européenne. Plus encore, nous devons assumer notre part de l’effort pour garantir la capacité d’action de l’Europe lorsque nous passerons d’une famille de 27 à une famille de plus de 30 membres. La tâche est colossale. C’est pourquoi la Présidence belge souhaite établir une feuille de route. Voici les quelques domaines dans lesquels nous comptons imprimer notre marque: le financement de l’Union, les futures priorités politiques à l’échelle européenne, le renforcement de notre démocratie européenne, une meilleure intégration de l’État de droit dans l’Union pour faire en sorte que les critères de Copenhague ne soient pas seulement des conditions à l’adhésion de l’Union, mais une obligation permanente car le respect de l’État de droit et de la démocratie ne peut pas être un élément secondaire de notre Union. Il doit être au cœur même de sa conception. C’est pourquoi nous continuerons à appliquer la procédure de l’article sept sous notre présidence car il s’agit des règles les plus fondamentales du contrat social européen. Ainsi, nous souhaitons également que les pays candidats à l’adhésion soient impliqués dans nos dialogues sur l’État de droit, et le plus tôt sera le mieux. Nous devons soutenir tous les pays qui ont l’ambition de construire un État de droit fort, une démocratie solide et, à partir de là, nous devons mener une lutte toujours plus acharnée contre la désinformation et les ingérences étrangères dans nos élections libres. En Belgique, comme dans de nombreux États membres, des puissances étrangères tentent d’affaiblir et de mettre à mal nos processus démocratiques. Nous le constatons, la lutte pour une union démocratique va de pair avec une capacité de décision accrue, car c’est ce que nos citoyens et citoyennes attendent de nous: que l’Europe agisse concrètement, qu’elle protège au quotidien et qu’elle assure leur prospérité. Si notre Union s’est construite sous l’impulsion de dirigeants visionnaires, elle est portée aujourd’hui par les attentes de ses citoyens. Agir concrètement pour nos citoyens, c’est ce qu’on a fait sous la Présidence espagnole, avec le Parlement européen, que je félicite d’ailleurs pour les progrès notoires accomplis, notamment en matière de migration. Dames en heren, migratie is een uitdaging die alle Europeanen bezighoudt. We moeten eerlijk zijn met hen. Dit is een complexe kwestie die niet van de ene op de andere dag zal opgelost worden. Migratie is zo oud als de mensheid zelf. Ze maakt deel uit van onze geschiedenis en ze zal ook deel uitmaken van onze toekomst. Of we dat nu willen of niet. Maar wat Europa wel kan doen, is migratie beheersbaar, controleerbaar en menselijk maken voor iedereen die betrokken partij is. Een meer gecoördineerd en geïntegreerd Europees buitenlands beleid is duidelijk een deel van de oplossing. We moeten brede partnerschappen aangaan met derde landen, samenwerken met hen op het vlak van energie, van handel, van onderwijs en van talentontwikkeling. Europa kan en moet de landen in ons nabuurschap stabieler maken. Enkel zo kunnen we op een structurele manier de verwachtingen van onze burgers inzake migratie inlossen. Daarom moeten we ook alles in het werk stellen om het leed van onschuldige burgers in Israël en Palestina een halt toe te roepen. We moeten aandringen op meer humanitaire corridors naar de Gazastrook, op veilige corridors die permanent openstaan. Het internationaal recht moet gerespecteerd worden. (Applaus). Europa moet Israël ook bijstaan in zijn gerechtvaardigde strijd om de gijzelaars weer vrij te krijgen en zijn legitieme strijd tegen de terroristische organisatie Hamas. Europese inspanningen om het lijden te stoppen van zowel Israëli’s als Palestijnen zijn niet onverenigbaar. Integendeel: het is het juiste om te doen. Enkel een politieke oplossing kan zorgen voor blijvende vrede en veiligheid in het Midden-Oosten. (Applaus) Ladies and gentlemen, our European project was born out of a devastating war. The darkest hours of our European history, marked by the Shoah, that led to moral insight and repentance. It provided Europe with a clear sense of direction. A duty also – a duty to support a democratic and free Ukraine against a war of aggression from Russia, a duty to help build a path to lasting peace between Israel and Palestine, but above all, a duty to ourselves, to future generations, to pass on a Europe that is more free than the one that we live in today. And let us be clear, that is not self-evident. We see glimpses from those darkest hours in our societies today. We see today women’s rights under pressure. We see the rights of minorities and of LGBTQI people curtailed. We see the return of fascist symbols in our streets and a rise of anti-Semitic violence. The fight against our demons never ends. It remains our most important task – the most important task for all of us. Yet you see a lot of young Europeans from all corners of our continent who are more than ever committed to a free Europe – a Europe where you can live where you want, a Europe where you can love who you want, a Europe where you can be who you want. These values is what is at stake at the European ballot boxes in June. Ladies and gentlemen, it is a cause worth fighting for.",-,2024-01-16,2.

President,"The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the presentation of the programme of activities of the Belgian Presidency (2023/2959(RSP)). On 1 January, we welcomed Belgium to the helm of the Council of the European Union, and today it is a pleasure to have with us Prime Minister Alexander De Croo. Prime Minister, welcome to the European Parliament. The Belgian Presidency will be the one that closes off this legislature, and as we head into the final busy months, the European Parliament is ready to deliver on what our citizens expect from our European Union. Since the last European Parliament elections we have adopted ground-breaking laws to make Europe fairer, more competitive and fit for the digital age. We have overcome pandemics, we have addressed our climate obligations and we have come together in the face of Russian aggression in Ukraine. We have given a real European perspective to Ukraine and to the Western Balkans, we have passed legislation that makes our people safer, more equal, more prosperous, and our children better able to fulfil their potential. So we are really living up to the promise of Europe. But there is still much work to do. The next months under the Belgian Presidency will be critical, particularly on migration. We are on the cusp of a historic agreement, and I know Belgium’s commitment to getting this over the line. Just a few weeks ago, our Conference of Presidents met you, dear Alexander, together with members of the Belgian Government. We held a forward-looking pro-European exchange. It is in that same pragmatic spirit that the European Parliament will continue to work with the Belgian Presidency. Dear Prime Minister, your country’s presidency comes at a crucial time in European history. We will rely on the famous Belgian ability to find compromise on difficult topics and we are confident that we will find a way forward that citizens will recognise before the elections in June. Prime Minister De Croo, the floor is yours. (Applause)",-,2024-01-16,2.

Maroš Šefčovič,"Madam President, Prime Minister, Madam Minister, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I think also this morning’s debate clearly demonstrated that Belgium takes the presidency at a very crucial time. As it was stated very well by honourable Members Lutgen, García Pérez, Vautmans and Lamberts, it’s clear that we are facing generational challenges. We have to promote democracy within and outside Europe. We need to strengthen Europe to thrive in this new, tough, geopolitically tense world which brought military conflicts so close to the European Union’s borders that it’s affecting our people and our economy. Therefore, Mr Prime Minister, we welcome your focus on competitiveness and also on the rollout of a socially fair Green Deal. In this regard, on top of the work on the remaining legislative files, we will continue our clean transition dialogues with the industrial sectors crucial for European future competitiveness and those sectors which are undergoing the most profound green and climate transition, including the discussions and dialogues with farmers as was proposed by Madam Niebler and Mr Mureşan. And I would like to reassure everyone that we approach these dialogues with a logic of inclusiveness, with the logic of the whole value chain collaboration and common endeavour to look at every aspect of our economy to perform better. We also increased our efforts to offset unnecessary administrative burden stemming from our legislation as much as possible. And also, we are working very hard to reduce the reporting obligations by 25 %. I am convinced that the Belgian focus on this very important competitiveness aspect of the EU economy, together with the important incoming reports of Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi, will bring us concrete suggestions to strengthen the strategic autonomy of Europe. To honourable Member Dan Nica, I would like to reassure you that the Commission supports Romania and Bulgaria to strengthen external borders with the support of Frontex, and also by having the pilot projects on more structural basis. We will also continue to support the political discussions to ensure that the decision on lifting the internal border checks at land borders can still be taken by the Council this year. To conclude, Madam President, I would like to make the reference to the points raised by Madam García Pérez, Madam Vautmans, but also several other colleagues from this House who have been underscoring the importance of Ukraine – and we will have a chance to discuss this aspect further with Madam Minister in our subsequent debate – because the issue of support of Ukraine, but also a further progress in our enlargement process, are historical tasks of this Parliament, this Commission and the Council. And to achieve the progress we need in this historic task, we urgently need the revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework. I know how high this is on the priority list of the Belgian Presidency, and we will be working hand-in-hand with you, Mr Prime Minister, to have a positive outcome, hopefully already at the next extraordinary European Council at the beginning of February. So, dear Prime Minister, Madam Minister, honourable Members, I would like to wish all the best to the Belgian Presidency. Good luck with all the very difficult, challenging files and we are looking forward to the closest possible cooperation. I am sure that in six months will be celebrating a positive, successful outcome of your presidency.",-,2024-01-16,2.

Didier Reynders,"Monsieur le Président, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, je suis très heureux d’être parmi vous aujourd’hui pour ce débat sur la nouvelle directive que nous avons proposée pour donner aux consommateurs davantage de moyens d’agir en faveur de la transition verte. De nombreuses pratiques commerciales trompeuses telles que l’obsolescence précoce, l’écoblanchiment, le manque de transparence et de crédibilité de certains labels de développement durable, ont été identifiés au sein de l’Union européenne au cours des dernières années. Ces pratiques ne sont pas adaptées aux objectifs de transition écologique établis dans le cadre du Pacte vert. Dans ce contexte, la Commission se réjouit de l’accord conclu par les colégislateurs en septembre de l’année dernière sur cette nouvelle directive, et je tiens à féliciter les colégislateurs parce que le texte est maintenant prêt pour son adoption finale par le Parlement. La Commission est convaincue que les nouvelles règles amélioreront la protection des consommateurs et permettront à ceux-ci de faire des choix plus durables, contribuant ainsi à la transition verte. Ces règles garantiront également une égalité des conditions de concurrence pour les entreprises et amélioreront le fonctionnement du marché intérieur. I would like to thank you for the work done, and in particular by the rapporteur, Ms Biljana Borzan, and the IMCO Committee, on this important proposal for consumer protection. I particularly welcome that the co-legislators found an ambitious but balanced agreement to ensure that consumers can more easily contribute to the green transition. Let me highlight a few elements. For example, the new directive will strengthen the credibility and transparency of voluntary sustainability labels, by ensuring that they are based on certification schemes, or established by public authorities. Furthermore, an important novelty is also that companies will no longer be able to claim that their products are ‘climate-neutral’, ‘positive for the climate’, or ‘have a reduced impact on climate’ based on carbon-offsetting projects outside the products’ value chain. Today, we see too often that such claims give the misleading impression to consumers that the consumption of such products has no impact on the environment. I am also pleased that consumers will be better protected against several harmful practices associated to the early obsolescence of goods. For instance, any commercial communication on goods with features introduced to limit their durability will be banned. Lastly, the Commission also welcomes the new rules that will provide better information to consumers at the point of sale, via a new harmonised label on the durability of goods, and a harmonised notice reminding consumers of their legal guarantee rights, thanks to the Parliament’s efforts. This will ensure that consumers will more easily identify which goods are truly durable, and for how long, and will make them more aware of their rights. In conclusion, the Commission strongly believes that the new directive is a major step forward to empower consumers to buy more sustainably, to facilitate enforcement by public authorities, and to create a level playing field for businesses. We believe that – together with other related legislative initiatives, such as the Green Claims proposal, the eco-design regulation, and the proposed directive on the right to repair that we will again discuss in the trilogue at the beginning of February – it will support the necessary changes to implement the EU Green Deal. So, I thank you for your attention, but I thank you first of all for your support.",-,2024-01-16,8.

Antonio López-Istúriz White,"Mr President, we all want the conflict – in this room also – the conflict in the Middle East to end. But, Minister, apart from five minutes talking about Israel, it would be good, and it would be a European solution, if you would dedicate maybe one second to talk about Hamas, Hezbollah, and about future perspectives. That would be a European solution. But your people forgot about it. As nobody can turn a blind eye to the losses of human life in Gaza and the humanitarian challenges faced by the Palestinian people. True. As we cannot forget either the pain of the Israeli families waiting in despair for the return of their loved ones. We all want it to end, and there is a solution for that: the release of Israeli hostages and the demilitarisation of Gaza. On 19 October, this Parliament agreed by a compelling majority that Hamas can no longer be part of the future of Palestine. As we have always done, we keep supporting a two-state solution. But sustainable peace cannot exist as long as Hamas and other terrorist groups hijack the Palestinian cause and threaten the existence of Israel, the only democracy of the region. Remember, we are talking about two parts, okay? Not only one. We cannot ignore either the elephant in the room, the puppet master: Iran. It is now clearer than ever who is behind and benefiting from this crisis. Do we want to be puppets of the regime? By failing to keep our unity, we are just taking us further away from peace. Dear colleagues, at some point this Parliament will have to make a clear choice to say no to those who murder women, homosexuals, Christians, Jews; to say no to those who reject our democratic principles and deny Israel’s right to exist; or face a future where Iran and their proxies will succeed in denying any hope for democracy and peace in the Middle East. Make no mistake: Europe is the next target. From the beginning, our position was clear. October resolution that we made. We set the conditions for peace.

Adam Bielan,"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, today we discuss a proposal pivotal to empowering consumers in the European Union and the fight against unfair commercial practices. This initiative significantly enhances transparency around product sustainability, guiding consumers toward choices with detailed information on durability and reparability. It balances regulatory measures with market dynamism, fostering innovation for our European companies. Importantly, the proposal embraces a voluntary guarantee mechanism promoting legal frameworks that strengthen market operations without imposing obligations. We are not enforcing the Green Deal – instead, we are making it attractive and beneficial for companies and consumers. Lastly, the inclusion of a review clause, proposed by my political group, reflects our foresight. It’s crucial to assess digital service and software regulations, ensuring they are neither overly burdensome nor unnecessary.

Željana Zovko,"Mr President, on 7 October, I was in Cyprus visiting and seeing the situation which Cyprus, a member country, is living – and 7 October was a day that will always stay in my memory. It’s something unimaginable that could have happened: the atrocities, the kidnapping of poor young people, and still their families don’t know their whereabouts. It’s a reminder of how cruel we are. Not many of you mentioned the hostages. Hamas is not only keeping the hostages in Gaza, they are also keeping hostage whole peoples, trying to get sympathy to divide Europe and to divide the world. Whoever is praying for voters based on a campaign, and dividing the people of Europe on this issue, has not lived through the war. We have a saying that whoever advocates for war and divide and conflict, let this war be in his or her house. The sad story about hostages and their families that are still waiting for the loved ones to return home should be the theme of this debate. To all of those that are using harsh words, I would just like to remind them: one day, history will call upon them and ask them, ‘Where were you, where the war was on the verge of our homes?’ One the last point: I just want to say that in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Komšić is using this for his campaign. He was not fighting and he was not a true man. He is sitting in a chair that was provided by peace and reconciliation. So let him shut up and let’s start reconciliating people in Europe and abroad.

Together with the majority of the world, they concluded that we are witnessing one of the greatest atrocities of this century, and they are right. This war has tormented generations, children’s futures, families and a whole people. This war brings out the worst forms of sexual and gender-based violence, including the Hamas attack on 7 October. These war crimes cannot go uninvestigated and unpunished. This war forces women in Gaza to give birth under the most inhumane conditions, and has caused the most civilian casualties in such a brief period. The world is looking at us. How many more debates are still needed until we realise that we must demand a ceasefire now? Bring an end to this nightmare. Think of the children in Gaza, as nothing justifies the 10 000 killed children. I ask the Commission to maintain the credibility of the European Union as human rights champion.

Anna-Michelle Asimakopoulou,"Mr President, 100 days have passed since 7 October, when unspeakable atrocities were committed by the terrorist organisation Hamas against innocent Israeli civilians. But as our attention moves today to the risks of regional escalation and broader conflict in the region, we risk forgetting the plight of the victims, forgetting the need for accountability and justice. We must not let this happen. We must continue to press for answers that the victims and their families deserve. The full extent, ladies and gentlemen, of the horrors of 7 October are not yet known. At a recent hearing, though, of the UN Human Rights Council, independent experts were very clear about the scale and severity of the attacks, particularly those of a sexual nature. In their statement, they noted that ‘the growing body of evidence about reported sexual violence is particularly harrowing, with female bodies found with their clothing pulled up to their waist, with torn or stained underwear with blood.’ We must investigate. We must find answers. We must understand the full extent of these crimes, because it appears that sexual violence was not the act of rogue soldiers, but a deliberate tactic of war.

Hopes for lasting peace in the region are shattered again. Palestinians are dying on an unprecedented scale – survivors facing hunger, disease and cold. Israel has the right to self-defence and to bring its hostages home. At the same time, civilians in Gaza have the right to protection and humanitarian aid. The crucial question is: how can both be achieved? This is the debate we need to have with Israelis, with Palestinians, with our Arab partners – but before all, it seems, among us.

Evin Incir,"Mr President, colleagues, where is our credibility to be able to demand respect for international law if this Parliament and our governments cannot stand up for it at every time and everywhere? Let me remind everyone in here about the following facts: Israel has killed over 24 000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women, children, elderly and UN staff, since 7 October, as a response to Hamas’s despicable terrorist attacks. Yes, Hamas should be combated, not innocent civilians. Over 57 000 Palestinians have been injured; more than 85% – that is, 1.9 million – of the population in Gaza are internally displaced. If these atrocities are not sufficient for us to demand: a permanent ceasefire; full support for the ongoing investigation by the International Court of Justice; sanctions against Israeli settlements in Palestine; utilisation of the tools provided in the EU-Israel Association Agreement that require respect for international law, including human rights; and to ensure sufficient support for the important work of UNWRA – then, my colleagues, I question what it will take for the EU to consistently stand up for international law. Furthermore, I wonder about the credibility of our Union. History is being written today and my question is which side do you stand on – international law or not?",S&D,2024-01-16,"12.

Charlie Weimers,"Mr President, the war between Israel and Hamas is between a liberal democracy defending itself against an EU-listed terror organisation supported by authoritarian states such as Iran, China, Russia and North Korea. To establish a ceasefire, the answer is simple: Hamas must release all hostages, including the remains of those murdered, and ensure their safe and dignified return to Israel. For peace, Palestinians must end their support for terrorism. Their support for Hamas is at an all-time high.

Jordi Solé,"Mr President, 100 days of war in Gaza, 100 days of death, destruction and human failure. After the massacre of hundreds of innocent Israeli citizens on 7 October, the massacre of thousands of innocent Palestinian citizens in the 100 days that have followed. Violence breeds violence and international humanitarian law today lies under the rubble of Gaza. I do not question the need to respond to address atrocities such as the ones on 7 October. What I do question is that there was no way to respond other than the one that has claimed the lives of nearly 20 000 people so far. The one that has wiped out 1% of the population of Gaza: 10 000 children, entire families, journalists, doctors, teachers and workers from international agencies. You won’t convince me that there was no other way to retaliate against Hamas. This carnage must stop now. Both sides must cease hostilities and reach a permanent ceasefire. All hostages have to be released, and the EU should be using now fully our leverage to help stop this war. Let international justice take its course. Let the courts, including the ICJ, do their work so that war crimes and crimes against humanity that may have been committed don’t go unpunished.

Pedro Marques,"Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, colleagues, as we speak, bombs keep falling in Gaza. Civilians are getting killed by the thousands. Children are dying in this dreadful war. 24 000 deaths, 70% of them women and children, and the war keeps going. To have an idea of the proportion of this death toll, it is the equivalent to 5 million deaths if it were the EU population. Yes, 5 million. Half of my country’s population. Much more than many of the European Member States. How can this happen and still be considered a proportional response to the atrocities of Hamas? As is well known, we condemned in the strongest possible terms the terrorist attacks of Hamas. We did it back then, we will always condemn it, and call for the release of all hostages. Hamas is a terrorist group that should be eliminated. No doubt about that. But the elimination of Hamas cannot be done at any cost. Civilians are not fighters. Children are not terrorists. Collective punishment, including famine and thirst, is not admissible. Those responsible for terrorist acts and violations of international law and war crimes, all of them must be held to account. As always, we reiterate our strong support and trust on the International Criminal Court and the Court of Justice. No exceptions. The total destruction of Gaza, the flattening of every inch to the ground will not bring peace or justice to the region, will not keep Israel safer. The bloodshed must stop now. Humanitarian aid must be allowed to access the entire Gaza urgently. And an immediate and permanent ceasefire must be settled, which is the only thing that can pave the way for any viable solution. The occupation of the Palestinian territories, including Gaza, must end, and an independent Palestinian state must be established following the spirit of the Oslo Accords.

Abir Al-Sahlani,"Mr President, in an average school in Sweden, there are around 200 children. If Sweden were Gaza one school, full of children would be killed every other day. One school full of children would be bombed by the Israeli occupation forces to death every day. Since the Israeli war against Gaza, over 10 000 children have died. Many more are still missing, buried under collapsed buildings. Thousands have been seriously injured. More than 1000 children have lost their legs. If this is not a reason to lay down every damn weapon in this conflict, then this world has gone completely mad! In December, I visited the Rafah Crossing between Gaza and Egypt, and there I saw humanitarian help desperately needed in Gaza, but not reaching the people who are suffering and starving. Suffering primarily because of Israeli bombs. Starving mainly because of the Israeli blockade. Without a ceasefire, this catastrophe will just go on and on and more children will be killed. I call upon the EU to demand an immediate ceasefire, so our humanitarian aid can actually reach, to respect any decision made by the International Court of Justice regarding the ongoing violence in Gaza, to raise our voices and open our eyes, to be the defendant to the end of every child’s right to life.",Renew,2024-01-16,"12.

Janez Lenarčič,"Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, Minister Lahbib, more than three months after the beginning of the Israeli military operation against Hamas, triggered by the horrific terrorist attacks of 7 October, the humanitarian situation in Gaza is tragic. The number of civilian casualties in Gaza, including a very high proportion of children, is unacceptable. The protection of civilians is of utmost importance, and Israel must do more to exercise maximum restraint. Respect for international humanitarian law is imperative and non-negotiable. This is a message that we consistently pass to Israel, and Hamas must release all hostages without preconditions. While Israel maintains its military objectives to destroy Hamas, with 60% of housing stock and infrastructure destroyed, humanitarian actors already describe Gaza as an unliveable place. A new humanitarian pause is needed now. The situation is worsening by the day, with 85% of the population now being displaced, often living in the open and facing the risk of famine and disease. The EU is doing its part to contribute to alleviate the humanitarian crisis, with more than EUR 100 million in humanitarian aid in 2023. There have been some positive steps like the opening of the Kerem Shalom crossing, but clearly more is needed. Humanitarian aid and access need to be considerably scaled up. Humanitarian actors, including the United Nations, whose role is central to the relief effort, need to be given unfettered access across Gaza, including the north. The war has regional consequences at the border between Israel and Lebanon, but also in the Red Sea and in Iraq and Syria. Efforts must continue to prevent further escalation, and the EU and its partners will continue to be actively engaged in this end. The fragile situation in the West Bank only adds to the risk of spillover. In 2023, and since the beginning of this year, we have seen unprecedented levels of extremist settler attacks, forced displacement of Palestinian communities and extensive movement restrictions. The Palestinian economy is also hampered by Israel withholding Palestinian tax revenues. In any future scenario for the day after, the Palestinian Authority must be reinvigorated and ultimately return to Gaza. They are ready for this, but a lot of help is needed. The EU will continue to play its part. In December 2023, the Commission adopted a EUR 118.4 million assistance package to support the Palestinian Authority. A larger midterm package will be put forward in 2024. This will aim to convey support to the Palestinian Authority and lay the ground for longer-term economic and political stability in Gaza and in the West Bank. Amid the humanitarian tragedy unfolding in Gaza, UNRWA and other UN agencies are playing a crucial role in facing enormous challenges. I wish to pay tribute to their staff, who do irreplaceable, lifesaving work at great risk to their own lives. We frontloaded the 2023 EU contribution to UNRWA in February last year. We hope to do the same in 2024, and we have encouraged Arab and Gulf partners to increase their contributions. Altogether, we provided almost EUR 110 million in funding to UNRWA in 2023, including a top up of EUR 10 million last November to help UNRWA face the enormous challenges in Gaza. And a substantial increase in our humanitarian support: quadrupled to over EUR 100 million in total last year. As already mentioned, even higher levels of humanitarian aid are being mobilised for this year. To conclude, the EU is firmly committed to work on multiple parallel tracks, stepping up humanitarian assistance, preventing regional spillover of the conflict and working towards a peaceful two-state solution. I am looking forward to our discussion.",-,2024-01-16,"12.

As the effects of climate change become more real and deadly, consumers are demanding to make empowered choices. Green products, sustainable practices and ethical sourcing are what a new generation of consumers want, and yet we actually make it more difficult for consumers to make these types of informed choices. Greenwashing and its consequences are a scourge. For too long, manufacturers have been able to claim that their product is sustainable or ethically sourced without requiring proof. This new legislation is a clear sign of action that the EU is prepared to give consumers proper information. Now consumers can rely on clear labelling. Generic environmental labels such as ‘biodegradable’, ‘eco-friendly’ and ‘climate neutral’ will be prohibited. Consumers will now have to be informed which products are more durable and reparable, and real consequences for traders and companies which do not abide by these laws.

Didier Reynders,"Mr President, honourable Members, we are in fact balancing two vital objectives of our democratic society, supporting the work of NGOs and the protection of all financial interests. That is why I highlighted the vigorous and evolving legal framework in place showing the protection of EU financial interests, including as regards NGOs. Concerning the question from Ms Hohlmeier, may I repeat the answer given by my colleague Johannes in May last year, to a parliamentary question – Ms Hohlmeier will maybe read the answer. I quote: ‘The Commission has awarded grants to a total of nine projects involving the NGO ‘No Peace without Justice’ under funds directly managed by the Commission. These projects have spread over a period of over 15 years, starting from 2006. EU funding for the seven projects that were completed amounted to EUR 5 million. Out of these seven projects, three of them had multiple beneficiaries. The amount received by the NGO from the seven projects is no more than EUR 4.62 million. EU funding for the two ongoing projects amounts to approximately EUR 2.7 million. Of this, EUR 1.37 million has not yet been paid by the Commission and is now suspended as a precautionary measure, pending an internal evaluation’. Of course, mindful of limiting the administrative burden for all beneficiaries, I would like to close by emphasising the Commission’s continued work with Parliament to ensure adequate protection of EU financial interests and EU values. So we need to continue to work for the protection of our financial interests and to promote a specific role for the NGOs in many different actions that we are organising, and certainly also in the fight against corruption.",-,2024-01-16,9.

Marc Angel,"Mr President, dear Commissioner and colleagues, consumers and their choices: they play a central role in the green transition and also in boosting the circular economy. Indeed, many want to consume more sustainably. However, in many ways, the odds have been against them. A bewildering jungle of labels and dubious environmental claims, products designed to have a limited lifespan, or a lack of information about the repairability of products have meant that consumers have found it difficult to make greener choices and contribute meaningfully to the green transition. We, as the Socialists & Democrats, have long advocated measures to counter such unfair commercial practices, and this directive is a game changer. It will, for example, strengthen the credibility, transparency and monitoring of labels to avoid green- and social washing. It equally proposes strong measures to tackle early obsolescence and provides more information to consumers about their rights under the legal guarantee of products. With this directive, we empower Europeans to choose products that are more durable, repairable and sustainable. It is emblematic of how our European Union can benefit Europeans in their everyday life. Thank you to the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for the good work.",S&D,2024-01-16,8.

Mick Wallace,"Mr President, climate neutrality claims based on offsetting are a massive contributor to climate mitigation deterrence. Climate claims for products based on carbon offsetting will now, based on Parliament’s work, be added to the list of unfair commercial practices. This ban is limited to products, it doesn’t cover company-wide claims, but it is still significant. These changes are also currently impacting the ongoing negotiations for the Green Claims Directive and the carbon removal certification framework. The Empowering Consumers Directive is now an important backstop for future anti-greenwashing policy. There claims to be a newfound appetite to tackle offsetting – if not in the Commission, then certainly in Parliament and arguably also in the Council.

Didier Reynders,"Mr President, honourable Members, I want to thank you and in particular Mr Pieper for the opportunity to discuss this report. The Commission would firstly like to highlight the open cooperation with the European Parliament in the process of preparing the report. The Commission acknowledges and supports the crucial role of non-governmental organisations in fighting corruption and in protecting and promoting fundamental rights, rule of law and democracy. The Commission is led by the objective of protecting the EU’s financial interests, a goal we share with the European Parliament. The Commission is both politically committed and legally bound to ensuring that organisations involved in criminal unethical practices, or those incompatible with EU values, do not receive EU financial support. This, of course, includes upholding the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. In this context, we feel that the report we are discussing today does not fully reflect the robustness of the existing legal framework, which helps us ensure a strong protection of Union financial interests for all beneficiaries, including NGOs. I would like to recall the main safeguards already in place today. The Commission’s early detection and exclusion system (EDES) is essentially a blacklist, which allows us to exclude problematic operators from receiving EU funding. We apply a rigorous selection process, carried out prior to the award of funding. Indeed, in all our discussions, we are occasionally accused of requiring too many checks for awarding funds. The close monitoring during the implementation of agreements and contracts; the various mechanisms in the contractual arrangements safeguarding the proper use of EU funds, including for the violation of EU values. If an entity is engaged in any criminal or unethical practices or acts against EU values, we have the legal framework in place to prevent such entities from receiving EU funds and EU funding. The Commission would also like to highlight the steps it has already taken to strengthen the transparency of funding to NGOs and provide more explicit safeguards for the protection of EU values. Upon proposal of the Commission, the Financial Regulation – recast politically agreed in trilogue already in December last year – provides the following: a definition of a non-governmental organisation and an obligation for all grant applicants to systematically declare whether they fall under this definition; ambitious transparency provisions that will ensure that the financial transparency system can act as a real, centralised platform for the publication of information in all management modes; an explicit new grant for excluding entities from EU funding under the early detection and exclusion system for incitement to discrimination, hatred or violence; and an explicit reference to the obligation for the Commission and Member States to respect EU values and the Charter of Fundamental Rights when implementing the budget. The Commission also adopted a proposal for a directive establishing a new form of non-profit associations. This will be a new vehicle fostering the EU democratic space while facilitating cross-border operations of associations. Last December, we presented the ‘defence of democracy’ package, which includes a draft directive aiming to establish mandatory national transparency requirements for all entities – including, where relevant, NGOs – undertaking interest representation activities on behalf of third countries. Those entities would be obliged to declare the annual amount of funding received from third countries. In light of all this, we would like to advocate for a balanced approach to EU funding to NGOs that ensures protection of EU financial interests, while imposing proportionate requirements to beneficiaries of EU funds. Stricter controls require more reporting and therefore more paperwork for beneficiaries. As a consequence, they inherently complicate access to EU funding for small organisations with limited capacities. The Commission will examine thoroughly the recommendations in the report and will work together with Parliament to continue ensuring that EU values and the principle of transparency are upheld in EU funding to all beneficiaries. Of course, we will try to take into account the remarks that will be possible to listen to today in your interventions. Thank you all very much for your attention and for your work.",-,2024-01-16,9.

Clare Daly,"Mr President, you can’t really go into a shop nowadays without everything you see being marketed as ‘climate neutral’. Whether it’s a pair of runners or a bunch of bananas, people are constantly bombarded by these generic claims, which actually don’t mean anything. We even have airlines selling ‘carbon-neutral’ flights. This has made a joke of the whole idea of conscious consumption and has lead shoppers into believing that they’re being codded, and they are, because generic environmental claims are inherently misleading, because they aren’t based on any standardised environmental performance. They’re often even specifically designed with a view to cod and intentionally fool the shoppers. So with this new legislation – and really thanks to the efforts of the Parliament – companies can no longer claim that their products are ‘climate neutral’, ‘eco-friendly’ or ‘green’. Carbon offsetting and calling them ‘carbon-neutral’ flights will also be outlawed. This is a really important step forward and fair play to the Parliament team for driving it forward.

Luke Ming Flanagan,"Mr President, the original report was simply a constant attack on all NGOs, blamed for everything, including Qatargate, and asked to provide more info than any other private company applying for EU funds. The original report also requested a certification body only for NGOs – an NGO regulation – but none for other beneficiaries, and even proposed to establish a blacklist against NGOs, and – guess what? – only NGOs. The good news, I suppose, is these most problematic points mentioned are no longer part of the final report, but I still consider it a soft attack on the NGOs. There are positives: the report now includes a differentiation between public transparency and information to discharge authorities, and avoids most of the witch-hunt approach present in the report against NGOs. The vital role played by NGOs and the need to fully respect civil society organisation, regardless of their field of actions and their structure, is now part of the report. You can’t pick and choose. Just because you mightn’t like someone, where they’re coming from, you can’t say, ‘take away their money’. Protection and support is an underlying element of the report. Concerns are expressed for the threats and attacks on NGOs in some Member States, including several explicit references to the Hungarian foreign interference and relevant ECJ court ruling against it. I have to say, I’m glad you’re waking up to Orbán in this Chamber, because I remember during the last mandate, there was an attempt to suspend me for calling him out and apparently using a bad word in here. Well, I’ll tell you, he does a lot worse. There’s also a paragraph under ‘General remarks’ chapter, and it is calling for a transparency requirement never to put NGOs and beneficiaries at risk. This general idea is also presented along the report. Also, the transparency requirements are focused only on the budgetary control aspects and are to be applied to all beneficiaries. On the negative elements in the report – and this has to be said – the report has a quite controversial position on Qatargate, still better than the original. It mentions Qatargate as an example of the alleged corruption cases which generated public discontent, and on a second paragraph, the report mentions the possibility for EU funds beneficiaries, including NGOs, to promote false narratives, as allegedly happened in Qatargate. Nevertheless, the paragraph continues by underlining that such concerns should not lead to a stigmatisation of all the NGOs. Overall, the report is better than the draft. Nevertheless, I still think it is a soft attack on NGOs and I’ll be voting against it.",The Left,2024-01-16,9.

Siegfried Mureşan,"Mr President, dear colleagues, NGOs are an essential part of our society. They give voice to those in need. They influence public opinions. They help raise awareness. They fight for democracy, for rule of law. They fight for human rights. They do this inside the European Union and they also do this outside the European Union. They are an essential part of our society. We talk to them; we listen to them. They manage budgets. They influence decisions and they influence public opinions. This is why it is normal that – like for any other entity, like for any other governmental organisation, like for us as civil servants – there are rules. It is normal that there are rules also for NGOs. We are also witnessing that, in the essential role which NGOs play in a society, most of them play this role, fulfil their mission in good faith. But we have also seen illegitimate actions from NGOs. These are not the rule, they are the exception, but they exist and we cannot deny this and we should not deny this. This is why the report put forward by Markus Pieper helps us to create rules which should identify any wrongdoings on the side of NGOs, and this helps us as decision makers, but it also helps keep the credibility high of those NGOs – many of them – which respect the rules. This is why the main call of the report for transparency, particularly for NGOs who receive money from the EU budget; we should know who is behind them, who finances them, who influences their decisions. The people of Europe have the duty to know this, and it helps also restore the credibility of NGOs. This is why my group will support this report.

Barry Andrews,"Mr President, Commissioner and colleagues, I had the honour to run two NGOs in Ireland over the course of my career. I just wanted to introduce a note of reality to this debate. The amount of compliance, governance and regulatory scrutiny that NGOs have to undergo throughout any EU funding project is well beyond anything that I’ve heard referenced in this debate. In addition, the work of monitoring and evaluation to ensure that funds are applied to the correct beneficiaries is also extraordinary. There is also extensive work on impact assessment in order to show a critical component of all logic frameworks that NGOs in receipt of EU funding operate. So yes, we have to really, properly scrutinise the question of sham NGOs that have been subject to influence operations. But we could end up undermining, not restoring, public trust in NGOs.

Mick Wallace,"Mr President, not all NGOs are perfect. Far from it. Some so-called human rights NGOs are, in fact, often guilty of instrumentalising human rights in the service of Western interests and imperialism. There are also lots of great NGOs who do amazing work, like Irish Wildlife Trust, Birdwatch Ireland, Carbon Market Watch. They have integrity and expertise and are constructive. We should be looking at institutional and structural failings within the European Parliament, not tarring all NGOs with the same brush. Many in this Parliament, especially the EPP, would be more than happy with the eradication of NGOs and civil society groups in order to clear an unimpeded path for big business. The corporate sector has a far greater lobby footprint in the EU than NGOs and civil society. It looks to me that some MEPs want to protect and promote the interests of big business, rather than those of the ordinary people.

Danuta Maria Hübner,"Madam President, I would like to thank all the colleagues for their remarks, and I would also like to thank all the shadows for their work, which was not easy, if you remember, and for their cooperation throughout the negotiations on this important file, and also for building a compromise which I believe is good for Europe.  Let me say again that the MiFID review comes at a critical time for the Union, and the consolidated tape will be a key element of our efforts to ensure that private investment is channelled into the economy efficiently. We also hope we will have an attractive ecosystem for new listings and a more efficient trading landscape. I expect it will boost investment activity, making the Union's markets easier to navigate and more attractive, including for small investors. Tomorrow's vote marks the beginning of the work for the implementation of the regulation. ESMA has already announced that by the end of this year, it will launch the public tender for the first consolidated tape for bonds, which will become operational as of 2025, and the Commission – as Commissioner Nicolas Schmit said – has begun already its work to make the reference data for derivatives more transparent and meaningful. So the work at level two will then continue for the next couple of years. The CMU for quite some time has been a key political project aimed at reducing dependence on bank funding and overcoming national differences, but it was a project that too often lacked the political will and momentum to drive the vision of a robust and integrated capital market union forward. But it was not the case in this review where, thanks to the strong support of all political groups in Parliament and of the Commission, we were able to secure an agreement that is a great success for the Parliament. This House has shown once more that we continue to show the ambition to push towards the creation of a truly single capital market union for the benefit of all European citizens. Given the positive outcome and the strong endorsement at the ECON Committee level, there were only two abstentions. There was no negative vote and nobody was against.

Mick Wallace,"Madam President, the Houthis have made a humanitarian intervention in the Red Sea in an effort to bring the genocide in Gaza to an end. The Houthis have killed nobody while disrupting shipping in the Red Sea, ships which were facilitating the Israeli genocide.   The Israeli regime has killed over 23 000 civilians. Over 10 000 of them are children. So who do the US and the UK attack? No, they didn’t attack the Israeli regime – because they're supporting the genocide. They attacked the Houthis instead, killing at least six people. So Western powers are prepared to kill people to protect the movement of goods, but the same Western powers kill thousands with sanctions in Iran, in Syria, in Venezuela, preventing the movement of some goods.   The Houthis are showing solidarity with the Palestinian people, just like South Africa did in The Hague.

Marc Botenga,"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, so following the Israeli attack on Gaza, Yemen has indeed been attacking ships, the Houthi groups, and denying freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. This has an impact on world trade. It also has an impact on factories in Belgium. It is, of course, remarkable, first of all, that those that are now calling for action against Yemen are the same ones that never called for action against Israel, protecting trade routes for some in this Chamber is clearly more important than protecting the lives of Palestinians. Now, we need to be clear, because those colleagues that say we need action seem to forget that there’s already been action. Last week, the United States, with a number of European countries, bombed Yemen, bombed cities in Yemen. This was not the first time. Barack Obama bombed Yemen. Donald Trump bombed Yemen. Joe Biden now bombed Yemen. Saudi Arabia bombed Yemen for years. And none of these interventions brought peace or security to the region. Rather, on the contrary, as these attacks were not covered by the Security Council resolution, which spoke about protecting vessels, not about bombing Yemen, this might actually deteriorate the image of Europe and the West in the world further. What we need is now a critical assessment of this policy and clearly look at the consequences and alternatives. And, of course, we need a ceasefire in Palestine as soon as possible.

Nicolas Schmit,"Madam President, dear Members, the debate today illustrates the importance and the complexity of the situation in the Red Sea and the Gulf region as a whole, and the challenges that the EU faces, indeed, in relation to this conflict, but also to other conflicts. The EU is actively working on solutions to restore maritime security in the Red Sea. This is an international problem that requires an international solution, and coordination. As you asked me about what the EU is preparing in relation to the EU NAVFOR Operation Atalanta, further options concerning the EU maritime response will be discussed at Council level, based on a proposal presented by the High Representative. The EU is engaging with partners in different diplomatic fora, and to protect navigational freedoms and maritime security, the EU considers ways to enhance its presence, assets and capacity of actions in the Red Sea and beyond. It is too early to evaluate the impact of the Houthi’s attack and US/UK retaliation on the discussions concerning an internal ceasefire in Yemen. The EU will continue to support UN Special Envoy Grundberg’s work and the UN-steered peace process leading to a final, comprehensive and inclusive peace deal, including a permanent nationwide ceasefire. Just one personal remark. I’m a bit surprised that those who are bombing every night civilians, killing civilians, destroying infrastructures, houses, apartments, that they are in the forefront to condemn what, finally, is a military operation against terrorist attacks against peaceful vessels.",-,2024-01-15,16.

Hannah Neumann,"Madam President, dear colleagues, it is crucial that we have a joint European response to the Houthi attacks in the Red sea, but at the same time, it is our duty to safeguard the progress that peace efforts have made in Yemen recently. The European Union indeed needs to play its part to secure a safe passage for commercial ships, to prevent a further increase in commodity prices in the region, and to ensure that the merchant vessel Galaxy Leader is freed, including its crew, among them EU citizens. To be honest, I'm a little surprised that it took the Council so long to come up with the proposal for an EU mission and hopefully a positive decision will be taken soon. But Commissioner, I was also surprised that you were not sharing any information on this with us here today. So do we really need to rely on political leaks to get the information? What is planned, what the process is, when the mission will be happening. So, maybe in your concluding remarks you could share some more information. At the same time, we have to make sure that the Yemeni people, who have been suffering from war, massive violence, escalation and a humanitarian crisis for 10 years will also be seen and will also be important in our response. I was in Yemen in December as the head of a delegation of this Parliament, and I can tell you, Yemenis want nothing more than this catastrophe to end. And we need to make sure that their voices are also heard in the ongoing debate, that their needs are taken into account when setting up our joint EU response, because otherwise the long-term effects of our policy in the region would be detrimental. Colleagues, allow me to make one more additional remark. All the drones and missiles that are being fired at merchant ships, or in the direction of Saudi Arabia, or even trying to target Israel, they were manufactured in Iran, they were transferred to the Houthis by the Revolutionary Guards, and no one will be able to bring peace to this region unless we finally dare to revise our Iran policy, to take a stance, to revise our relations with this brutal regime and to take a clear stance against the Revolutionary Guards.

Pedro Marques,"Madam President, Commissioner, colleagues, let me be crystal clear. We totally condemn the ongoing attacks on maritime activities in the Red Sea from these Houthi-controlled territories in Yemen with the support of Iran. The Houthi attacks threaten the international navigation and the maritime security in grave disrespect from international law, and they endanger the lives of the civilian crews, some of them already abducted, and create serious environmental and obvious economic risks. Contrary to what the Houthi leaders say, the attacks are of no help in addressing the war in Gaza. In fact, they further destabilise the region and create increased risks for the populations. They also destabilise the world commerce, with effects that are already being felt in many regions in the world. We don’t need another factor to fuel a possible economic crisis. We therefore urge the Houthis to immediately stop the attacks, and call on all parties to avoid further escalation in the region. We particularly want to tell directly to the Iran regime: be on the right side for once, on the side of stability in your own region. We call on the Member States to be meaningful and take immediate and concerted efforts to address these attacks if the Houthis, of course, do not stop immediately. We need an effective operation in the Red Sea, with an executive mandate to ensure the naval security in the region. This should be built from close cooperation with the regional actors, but also with our international parties, many of them which are already acting on the ground. There is no more time for ambiguities. Europe is a commercial stronghold in the world, but that also means we must protect our trade capacities. Europe and the world are already suffering from the consequences of successive wars, and the spike on energy prices and inflation that came with it. People are dying by the thousands because of these wars. We cannot add the death or the abduction of the crews in the Red Sea, the destruction of our vessels, and the health of a good part of the world commerce to all the tragedies already taking place in front of us. The EU is a world player and should act as such, including, as the High Representative referred recently, by enforcing the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2722, which reiterates that the states have the right to defend their vessels against these attacks in accordance to international law. Let us show that we can act. We will act when threats to the international law arise, no matter where or by whom these threats come to reality.",S&D,2024-01-15,16.

Nicolas Schmit,"Madam President, honourable Members, we are now here to discuss the repeated and unacceptable Houthi attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea, which violate international law, threaten maritime security and peace in the region, and disrupt global trade. Until today, 28 attacks were carried out by the Houthis since mid-November. The Houthis are presenting their repeated attacks as a support to the Palestinian people, and they have launched some missiles toward Israel. The Houthis, together with Hezbollah and some Iraqi and Syrian militias, are aligned with Hamas. The EU has continuously condemned those acts and underlined that they must stop, notably through the EU spokesperson’s statements of 5 and 13 December, and through our latest EU 27 statement of 12 January. The EU also called for the immediate release of the Galaxy Leader vessel and its 25-member crew, illegally seized on 19 November. EU services are also following closely the joint military response of the UK and US, members of the Prosperity Guardian Operation, to repeated Houthi attacks against maritime vessels. The US and UK have carried out joint strikes on 11 and 12 January on over 60 targets at 16 sites in Yemen, with the support of Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands, as a response to repeated and escalating Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, notably the complex attack of 9 January, following repeated messages from the international community. The EU continues actively engaging and coordinating with partners in all diplomatic fora to counter the Houthi threats to commercial vessels and find effective solutions. The High Representative, on behalf of the EU and its Member States issued a joint statement, published last Friday, welcoming the 10 January UN Security Council Resolution 2722. The UN Security Resolution recognises that states are entitled to defend themselves against the attack against their vessels in perfect contradiction, by the way, of international law. The EU NAVFOR Operation Atalanta shares maritime awareness with the multi-nation Operation Prosperity Guardian from its operations in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. Further options will be discussed at the level of the European Council concerning the EU maritime response. However, it is unlikely that the Houthis will be deterred immediately, given the international visibility they have enjoyed with these actions. Houthi leaders have already indicated they will continue their attacks as long as the situation in Gaza remains. They have already resumed attacks, with a missile fired towards US forces on 14 January. The last point of concern is the impact these developments in the Red Sea can have on peace efforts in Yemen, which had reached a new positive phase on 23 December with the UN’s takeover of the peace process following a year of Saudi-Houthi backchannel talks.",-,2024-01-15,16.

Eero Heinäluoma,"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Professor Hübner, and her team for leading the work on this important piece of legislation. This MiFID review is a key reform for two main reasons. Firstly, thanks to the newly created consolidated tape, investors will get clarity around where to find the best deal in the European Union. This is how a European market should work. Secondly, thanks to the push of also my group, we get rid of the harmful practice of payment for order flows. This is absolutely necessary as this regime generates the worst outcomes for their clients. Of course, this MiFID review is only the first step towards a capital markets union which serves investors. The next big test lies in the retail investment strategy, which is being negotiated right now. If we really want to create a well-functioning capital markets union which can finance all the challenges ahead of us, let’s follow the logic of the MiFID review with the ban on payments for order flows, which is one type of inducement. Indeed let’s put the interest of retail investors in the centre and let’s go for a full ban on inducements. All independent studies demonstrate that a full ban on inducements leads to better deals for retail investors. Overall costs for products that carry inducements are nowadays around 25% higher than those products which do not carry inducements. Colleagues, EU citizens want to get a fair deal, and rightly so. Let’s stop financing unsustainable business models. Tomorrow I hope we get rid of payments for order flows. Next I hope we can get rid of all inducements.

Mick Wallace,"Madam President, in the last 20 years, beginning in the year 2000, there’s been a gradual deregulation of the financial markets worldwide, beginning with the United States, with the rest of the world, including the EU, following suit. This deregulation has continued at pace, notwithstanding the global financial crisis of 2008. The gradual encroachment of financial speculators into new domains, such as food, water and housing, and the financialisation of these areas has had a serious negative impact on society and needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency, with regulation now required. We are in this position because we have let hedge funds invest and speculate on the human rights of our citizens. Grain, for example, can be sold 60 times on the market, and more sometimes, before it’s eventually used by people. In Ireland, US vulture funds have garnered huge control of the housing supply at a terrible cost to the Irish people, because the neoliberal Irish Government let them do so.

Clare Daly,"Madam President, I think in some ways this regulation is a little bit like trying to close the stable door after the horse has bolted. In 2007, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive introduced competition in the market of equity trading in line with the objectives of the European Union, which made free movement of capital a fundamental freedom protected by the Treaties. Now this is neoliberalism unleashed. What did you actually expect would happen? It was inevitable that speculators were going to gamble on the markets in food and commodities, enabling them to make massive profits while pauperising and starving people in the process. We see the global food price crisis that we’ve witnessed, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, really exposing the real nature of our society, which puts financial interests before the economic well-being of citizens. And while we may try to curb that power here and introduce transparency, the truth is that casino capitalism is uncontrollable. You can’t keep a tiger as a pet.

Nicolas Schmit,"Mr President, honourable Members, this debate on the reform of MiFIR and MiFID is of the highest importance, as just now outlined by the rapporteur. I thank you very much for your presentation. Reforming our market structure is essential to keep European capital markets both competitive and attractive. Creating consolidated tapes of prices for shares, bonds and certain derivatives is an essential tool for the capital markets union we absolutely need in order to shoulder the enormous investments Europe has to make. They will collate pricing data that European and international investors need to make informed investment decisions. This is especially important for smaller investors, who currently don’t have the same sort of access to this data as large institutional investors do. We are very grateful for the efforts of Parliament, and we look forward to your vote tomorrow. You have contributed towards an ambitious outcome. After nearly two years of intense discussions, the result strikes a good balance. In no small part this is thanks to the efforts of Parliament’s negotiating team, and in particular your merit, Ms Hübner, who steered these talks. To mention some of the specific topics included in this review: first, on the consolidated tapes, the result is more ambitious than the original proposal. Some pre-trade information will be added straightaway to the consolidated tape for equity. This is thanks to the efforts of Parliament. This will undoubtedly reinforce the competitiveness of our capital markets. I also want to mention payment for order flow. This has been a contentious topic and a very important one for Parliament. Negotiations resulted in a full ban on this practice. On commodity derivative markets, Parliament introduced review clauses in MiFID that will allow us to assess their functioning also in light of the recent energy crisis. But it is important to keep in mind that a lot of work is still to come. The next step is implementing the new rules. Various technical measures will be developed in the coming months, so that the framework works in practice. The Commission, together with ESMA, is already working hard in this regard. Next year, ESMA will launch the first selection procedure for the consolidated tape for bonds. This will be followed by selection procedures for shares and exchange-traded funds, and later for over-the-counter derivatives. The Commission services have already started work on selecting the right identifier for over-the-counter derivatives.",-,2024-01-15,15.

Danuta Maria Hübner,"Mr President, I was running the last kilometre but I hope I will be able to do it, so thank you very much for this opportunity to remind us about the MiFIR and MiFID. Tomorrow we will vote to endorse the interinstitutional agreement on the review of the Regulation and Directive on the Markets in Financial Infrastructure. The changes to both MiFIR and MiFID modify the rulebook governing participation in European capital markets, which play a fundamental role in channelling capital to the real economy. We need to ensure that our economy grows strong and remains competitive as there are long term challenges around. Europe requires more than EUR 500 billion of additional investment funding annually to ensure its sustainable competitiveness and resilience. This is not a mere financial challenge. It is a strategic imperative. Yet we remain dependent on bank-based financing while our capital markets are lagging behind. They are fragmented, which contributes to the inefficient allocation of capital. The once vibrant landscape of initial public offerings – IPOs – now stands at less than half the size of the US new listings. The US stock market's value relative to GDP is nearly twice that of the EU. Many in this House will remember that we embarked on building the Capital Markets Union back in 2015, but the project was tailored to the EU of 28 Member States with a major financial centre across the channel, and the focus was on national capital markets rather than on the removal of cross-border barriers. We need urgently to move away from fragmented capital markets and towards the idea of a capital market union. Advancing towards a truly single and vibrant capital market union is of fundamental importance for European open strategic autonomy. This context to the MiFIR and MiFID review, which had four key objectives: to reduce market fragmentation and market data costs; to harmonise and simplify the transparency rules; to enhance the levels of investor protection; and to increase the attractiveness and competitiveness of EU markets. I can proudly say that the text that we will vote on tomorrow achieves all these objectives. Thanks to the assertiveness of our House, for the first time, Europe will have a consolidated tape, a database designed to democratise access to market data and improve data quality by providing a continuous electronic live data stream on prices and trading volumes, consolidating the information obtained from multiple trading venues across the EU. It will reduce the fragmentation and cost of market data, will empower financial institutions and retail investors to observe in a single place the price and volumes for shares, ETFs, bonds or derivatives in the Union. The discussions on the consolidated tape were the most difficult part of the package, due to divergent views on the exact features that this new market infrastructure should have. In the review, we have also taken a careful look at the functioning of the market transparency rules in the Union, as well as in other jurisdictions. We put forward changes that seek to increase the competitiveness of EU firms, supported by the simplification and harmonisation of the transparency rules applicable across Europe. We have introduced greater flexibility in the framework by empowering the European Securities and Market Authority to set the thresholds and limits applicable to market transparency, and to oversee market developments, intervening when required. The harmonisation and simplification of transparency rules should strengthen the level playing field between all market participants and increase the overall transparency of European market structure. The report also mandates the Commission to carry out a holistic assessment of the financial markets legislation with respect to commodity derivatives, in light of the learnings from the energy crisis. To conclude, thanks to the efforts of the negotiating team, to whom I am really grateful for the openness, the final text contains many of the elements that the Parliament was calling for throughout the negotiations, and I believe that the final compromise represents a great victory not only for the Parliament, but for all those who care about the importance of the European Capital Markets Union.",PPE,2024-01-15,15.

Bas Eickhout,"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank everyone for contributing to the debate. It seems we have a solid majority for the vote tomorrow, and I'm really very thankful to the shadows and all the colleagues who contributed. So thanks very much for that. I just have to say that some colleagues expressed some criticism, but I had the feeling that this was more for their own YouTube channel than it was based on the facts of the legislation. Maybe I just want to explain that, and maybe they can add this element then to their YouTube channel – which they probably will not do, but nevertheless you always have to try. First of all, to Mr Nissinen from the ECR and Sweden. He was very much concerned about what is going to happen with all the people that have already bought heat pumps – uh, nothing, because this is about new equipment. So later on when you buy a heat pump, it will not contain those damaging gases. The ones you bought, you can use and you will use – you know that very well, but of course it didn't fit your story. Some of the ID colleagues were very much concerned that we are not looking at the market. Well I would say, Mr Lancini, that it is you who are not looking at the market. First of all, at this moment, the new monoblocs of heat pumps coming on the market already are without F-Gases. So the market is already there. The deadline we have is 2032, although they can deliver already now. So if we add them eight more years and they can deliver already and you are concerned they count, maybe you should catch up with the developments in the market. The same goes for split systems. The innovation is ongoing. They are delivering already now, they are available not so much yet, and that's why therefore the date is 2035. We even give them ten years. I think that is looking at the market. It is also looking at where the innovation is happening and that is European industry.

Nicolas Schmit,"Mr President, thank you very much for this very constructive debate.

These rules will be the most ambitious in the world. This will allow others that start to reduce their consumption of F-gases to put in place ambitious policy. Important is the signal we put in place aimed at phasing out the use of these gases. With such legislation in place, we will be in an excellent position to advocate more ambitious measures on F-gases, on ODS under the Montreal Protocol. With your vote tomorrow, you can ensure that we can continue this success story of European environmental policy, a prime example of ambitious climate measures combined with the promotion of green technologies made in Europe.",-,2024-01-15,14.

Mick Wallace,"Mr President, fluorinated gases are supercharged greenhouse gases. Their impact on the climate is often thousands of times more powerful than that of CO2. F-Gas emissions have increased by 60% since 1990, and it's well past time that we seriously tackle their use. The heat pump industry has expressed a lot of concern about this regulation. Heat pumps are essential for Europe's energy transition. In Ireland, more than 80% of new homes built in the last number of years have heat pumps. The industry there is doing really well and should be commended, and we should of course listen to the concerns about availability of alternatives to F-Gases. But there is an emergency brake in the regulation and, also, additional quota can be provided to heat pump manufacturers if shortages arise that might endanger the EU's heat pump installation targets. The EU now needs to give clear financial and political support to the heat pump sector, and since heat pumps are obviously the cleanest heating option, they should also be the most economically attractive to stimulate consumer demand.

Clare Daly,"Mr President, I think the title of this debate in some ways really sounds somewhat like a bit of a deluded fantasy when we all know that across Europe, social rights and workers’ conditions are under assault like never before, and public procurement, far from being the great leveller, is actually a contributing factor to this inequality. It’s legitimised theft on a phenomenal scale. It’s not only that jobs are priced on the basis of bleeding workers dry, but also the projects themselves end up costing phenomenally more than they should do. Contracts under EU rules mean driving out the small suppliers; the big boys move in, price the job too cheaply, and then add in clauses where they can ratchet up the costs later on. And as a result, as my colleague has said, we’ve a children’s hospital in Ireland which is about to become the most expensive in Europe, well over EUR 2 billion, a MetroLink project, 300 million without a track being laid. Is it any wonder that the results came out today, that 1 % of the population own a third of the wealth, while the working poor continue to slave on?

Nicolas Schmit,"Madam President, dear Members, I would like to thank the European Parliament for adding this very timely debate on the revision of the ELA mandate, and for the suggestions put forward with its resolution. The European Labour Authority is still a young agency, with high expectations attached to it. Living up to these expectations takes time and might require adjustments. ELA has already come a long way and its actions are making a real difference to ensure EU labour mobility. ELA is here to support, directly and indirectly, the millions of Europeans who live or work in another Member State, as well as businesses operating across EU borders. It offers practical support in cross-border employment via its network, helping jobseekers and employers find each other. It analyses labour mobility, providing us with intelligence, so we understand the latest trends and get the data we need. It tackles undeclared work, which deprives workers of social protection, distorts competition between businesses and leads to huge gaps in public finances. One of the European Labour Authority's main tasks is to improve access to information for mobile workers and their employers. It is not enough to have rules and regulations for social protection; workers need to understand them and employers need to assume responsibility for them. Europe should be the beacon, the gold standard when it comes to labour market conditions, regardless of where the worker comes from. ELA plays a central role in this endeavour.   Since it was created five years ago, ELA has supported more than 100 cross-border, joint and concerted inspections and has provided substantial support for the Member States, working to develop cooperation programmes, including on posting of workers. The Commission is currently in the process of evaluating the first five years of ELA's operation. Your resolution is extremely important in this context, together with the contribution from the Belgian Presidency via a conference organised at the end of January, which will contribute to the evaluation. When considering a possible revision of the mandate of ELA, we should take two points into account. First, we have to analyse carefully which parts of ELA's functioning could be improved eventually without such a revision. Second, it is important to see the final results of the evaluation and to draw the adequate conclusions. The mission of ELA is to improve enforcement of the fair mobility EU legislation. This needs to remain at the core while we address remaining challenges. For example, one of these challenges relates to the entry, employment and working conditions of third-country nationals. We recently had particularly worrisome situations with third-country nationals in the transport sector. ELA has been active and here is a need to evaluate if its means are sufficient and appropriate. The set-up of ELA allows a close involvement of social partners, but there is still scope for additional engagement. The suggestion that ELA should be able to bring detected breaches in front of a court of the concerned Member States will require a sound legal analysis. With regard to social security coordination and its digitalisation, a pilot project of the European Social Security Pass is ongoing. The support of ELA in this field will remain crucial, for instance, by facilitating the regular exchange of experiences between national authorities. There should be synergies between the work of different agencies for achieving efficiency gains and avoiding overlaps. This is particularly important when it comes to tackling skills mismatches, since other agencies, such as Cedefop, are also working on this matter. I am confident the European Parliament will continue to be our close partner to tackle these important challenges in the field of fair mobility. I thank the Members for their valuable input into the future of ELA. We share a common goal establishing a well-functioning and efficient labour authority that continues to strengthen fairness and trust in the internal market.",-,2024-01-15,18.

Mick Wallace,"Mr President, the EU public procurement directives allow contracting authorities to promote social inclusion, the protection of the environment, and look to ensure the compliance of tender awards with social, labour and environmental legislation. However, even with these directives incorporated into law in the various Member States, a public procurement process can result in disaster. In 2019, in the Irish Parliament, I highlighted several problems with the procurement process for the National Children’s Hospital. I showed how the costs were going to escalate off the Richter scale. The hospital wouldn’t be built for 2.2 billion when it should have cost about half that, and that’s what’s happening. The government could have revisited the contract, but it refused for political reasons, at great cost to the Irish people, I might say. The big contractor has robbed the people blind and it is just down to the incompetence of the politicians involved.",The Left,2024-01-15,"19.

I only heard two critical Groups here, so we are together here making decisions that we also don't need F-Gases that are 2.5% of our greenhouse gas emissions, and that number has doubled since 1990 unlike greenhouse gases in general. So I don't know if you should put a few in the museum and a few fridges or heat pumps for those who are not willing to change for the future. I’m very happy with the majority here, and then that balanced outcome that we can work for the people, for the climate and for our industries.

Nicolas Schmit,"Mr President, dear Members, I must say it was a very rich and very constructive and important debate because, indeed, it’s about billions and billions which are at stake. There are issues of corruption, and this is another issue we obviously have to fight and to find the right rules to prevent and to fight and to condemn those who are responsible for corruption. That’s clear. But does this mean that the price is the only indicator? Can our economies just function on the basis of price? You know, I was a labour minister and I was confronted several times with major labour work accidents. Probably these companies always were the best offering, lowest price. But then about working conditions. Well, they did not really respect them. Sometimes it went well and sometimes some workers just died or were hurt. And that’s why we cannot just base the spending of public money on one single criteria, which is price, because price is not a guarantee, as it was said for competition, at least not when we say fair competition. Because if you’re cheating, if you are not respecting labour rights, if you are not respecting protection of your workers, well, you will have the lowest price. But at what price? For whom? That’s why we have really to think how we create this balance, how we defend better the issue of social criteria. Environmental criteria is another one. If you spend money precisely to recycle your stuff, if you spend money to respect the environmental criteria, yes, this has a cost. And then if you have decided to do that, you may be excluded from any tender from any market. And that’s why, in this much more complex world, you just cannot base the spending of billions on one single indicator, which is price, because precisely, you never know who is paying at the end this price.  I think that this is a debate which should have some follow up, some consequence where we have to reflect how we integrate these criteria better in our public procurement in a way where, finally, those who decide get more security, more legal security, because sometimes there is the issue, well, if I integrate some other criteria that might be legal cases coming up and so on. So we have to reflect how better to integrate this in order to make sure that social considerations or environmental considerations have or can be fully taken into account. I agree that the issue of people with a disability is an important one. If you employ many people with a disability or some people with a disability, you may be less competitive and your price may be higher. But what you are giving back to society is also a value. And this is a value which has to be recognised absolutely, especially when it is about public money. Therefore I think that the Commission is committed to looking at whether further specific actions are needed, even of a legislative nature, which means that we have to look at the present texts, we need to combine the objectives of simplification of the public procurement procedures with measures to align public procurement with the strategic objectives and also among the strategic objectives. This includes, absolutely, the social considerations which have an impact on our society, on the prosperity of our society as well as the environmental dimension as we talk about the green transition.",-,2024-01-15,"19.

Radan Kanev,"Mr President, dear Commissioner, a lot has been said during this debate about the benefits of social criteria in public procurements and reasonable arguments we've heard, and a lot has been already done to grant such award criteria. So I will focus on the risks they raise because there is no perfect solution in the economy, neither are social award criteria a perfect solution. First, it is the risk of discrimination against companies from less wealthy Member States or Member States with lower levels of trade union coverage of social bargaining. Second, I must reiterate, any non-price criteria has a higher, often much, much higher corruption potential. And here, once again, we put at risk countries with less stable rule of law in our Union, and we know from all our debates that such countries exist in in the European Union and maybe more now than a few years ago. And by far the most and important risk that I would like to point out: often, not always, but often, social award criteria in public procurement have quite a high inflation potential. So they might end up providing better income for few and higher prices for many, at the expense of fair competition on the market. And here I must reiterate, finally, that one thing we as a union and our economy, now and in the years to come, at least in the couple of years to come, what we cannot afford is pro-inflation measures, because we have taken many such measures during this and previous terms, and we are facing a huge crisis of the purchasing power of our population, with all its political impact.",PPE,2024-01-15,"19.

Agnes Jongerius,"Madam President, Commissioner, dear Dennis, when the doorbell rings, do you open the door if you know your house is a little bit of a mess? I must say, I would be hesitant. I think most people would try to stall having guests over or at least try quickly to cover the biggest mess in some kind of cupboard. I think the same is true for Member States: if they know there are cases of labour exploitation, they might not be keen to invite the newest European agency over, the ELA. At the moment, the ELA is only allowed to have inspections when they are invited, thereby limiting their powers, and I think it's essential that the Commission be giving the ELA a bigger mandate after evaluation later this year. But workers need more than that. Because if only all European employers would be holier than the Pope, then we didn't need this agency, but sadly they are not. Some have not only exploitation of European workers on their hands, they also didn't seem to have a problem with exploiting non-European workers. And then, as already mentioned, the example of Grafenhausen, where lorry drivers went on strike at a rest stop for weeks in a row because they have not been paid for months in a row and the ELA was not able to intervene. When an EU-based employer is not paying its workers or is treating them badly, this should be investigated and prosecuted by the ELA, no matter if the workers are Europeans or non-Europeans. The Belgians are keen to get to work with the evaluation, and I understand from the contribution of the Commission that the Commission will join their efforts to finally ensure fair mobility in our Union, and that would be great.",S&D,2024-01-15,18.

Kim Van Sparrentak,"Madam President, go for the cheapest option. Ask any public authority what the European rules for buying goods and services dictate, and they think that’s what they have to do. And we are talking about 250 000 public authorities in the EU who spend around EUR 2 trillion per year through public procurement. That’s a two and then 12 zeros. It’s EUR 2000 billion. And we could use this money, which is 14 % of the EU GDP in a strategic way. We could try to achieve our social and environmental ambitions through public procurement. But in more than one third of Member States, up to 95 % of tenders are awarded solely on the basis of the lowest price. And this is because social award criteria are voluntary, and using them is considered a legal risk by many, many authorities. But we cannot accept that public money is being spent on cheap tenders and just let workers pay the price. Cleaners, call center workers, nursing home workers, security guards and other essential workers are employed with precarious working conditions with our public money. And because these are huge contracts, they’re impacting entire sectors. Our national and local governments are fueling a race to the bottom on wages and working conditions. But we can set strong social objectives in Europe. But then if social dumping is government sponsored, a true social Europe is very far from being realised. If the Commission is serious about promoting a social market economy, it should value social progress as much as the functioning of the internal market. So let us use all the tools we have in our toolbox to end precarious work and not stick to the voluntary approach for social conditionalities in procurement, which is doing the opposite. I call on the Commission to start preparing a revision of the Public Procurement Directive now, and present it early in the next mandate. We need to ensure that there will be no more public contracts granted to companies that have no collective agreements with their workers. And meanwhile, while we change the Public Procurement Directive, maybe we can also stop government sponsoring of the climate catastrophe.",Greens/EFA,2024-01-15,"19.

Agnes Jongerius,"Madam President, dear Commissioner, I think the holes in the EU's public procurement rules are too well known, because study after study shows that the voluntary nature of social public procurement is not really making enough of a difference. We still see this race to the bottom. Public contracts are most often awarded socially based on the cheapest offer, and too often to companies that violate labour rights. Secondly, the companies prioritise cost over quality of service and fair labour practices. And third, and in the end, it's the workers that suffer from the system because it leads to exploitation, underpayment and violations of their basic rights. The message of this debate today is we can no longer allow companies to lower their standards while maximising their profits at the expense of workers. Public spending must be conditional on social requirements, respect for collective agreements, for working conditions and for ILO Conventions. Finally, the Commissioner also mentioned the Minimum Wage Directive. We, in this directive, put the threshold of the minimum amount of people covered by collective agreements at 80%. How can we strengthen social, collective bargaining while, on the other hand, maintaining the existing public procurement rules, which limit the push for a higher coverage rate of collective bargaining? I think it's clear it's time for change.",S&D,2024-01-15,"19.

Nicolas Schmit,"Madam President, honourable Members, I would like to thank the Employment Committee for formulating these questions because, as you said now, the importance and the size of EU public procurement market is significant – 14 % of the EU GDP is spent every year by over 250 000 public authorities and entities to purchase goods and services, and to construct.  This economic significance also means that public procurement is a powerful leveraging tool for spurring innovation and developing social and environmentally friendly solutions. Public procurement is also increasingly recognised as an important strategic economic policy tool to pursue policies, including in the sphere of social responsibility, and to shape our internal market and make it more efficient but also fair. The EU Public Procurement Directive, adopted in 2014, aimed at transforming public procurement from a process driven legalistic exercise to a genuinely relevant physical for delivering change in Europe. Our procurement rules do provide public buyers with greater flexibility to use public procurement as a strategic tool. Yet it is a reality that more contracts could be awarded based on quality criteria, supporting the green and social transition, and not only based on the lowest price. And recently, by the way, the Commission has recommended that in the field of green technologies, in the face of foreign competition that does not always respect all the rules, this is precisely the approach that has to be applied. This underlines not only the social aspect, but also the industrial and strategic aspect that has to be fully taken into account. Now, on your first question, the current EU public procurement directives do allow public authorities to ensure decent working conditions for the staff executing the contract in line with EU labour law. They also require economic operators to comply with all applicable EU or national labour obligations, including on collective agreements and bargaining during the performance of the contracts. The Commission has also developed several actions to provide guidance to the public authorities, in particular the Commission’s Buying Social Guide, published in May 2021, provides public buyers with clear and concrete guidance on how to make their procurement more socially responsible and to ensure compliance with labour law. And this also applies, by the way, to social enterprises, to give social enterprises also the possibility to be part of public procurement. The Commission has also launched the Big Buyers Working Together project to support collaboration between public buyers and to promote the wider use of strategic public procurement. This new project includes, inter alia, activities specifically relating to social procurement. It aims to build better understanding of the social, labour and ethical impact of public contracts, and how to use public procurement to achieve a positive impact in these areas. As to your second question, the ILO Convention No 94 is indeed not yet added to the list of ILO conventions in Annex X of Directive 2014/24 on public procurement. The reason for this is that the ILO conventions listed in this annex are part of the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and they have already been ratified by all EU Member States. The fundamental principles and rights at work have to be realised, respected and promoted by all members of the ILO. Grounds for amending the list in the annex are set out in Article 56 of the directive to add new international agreements that have been ratified by all Member States. However, as mentioned, Convention No 94 is not yet, hopefully, currently ratified by all Member States. In relation to measures to ensure compliance with the fundamental ILO conventions, the Directive on Public Procurement sets out that Member States shall take appropriate measures to ensure that in the performance of public contracts economic operators comply with applicable obligations in the fields of environmental, social and labour law established by Union law, national law, collective agreements or by the international environmental, social and labour law provisions listed in Annex X. I also want to refer that finally, it’s due to the European Parliament that there is a social clause in the Procurement Directive, and that also when we discussed about the Adequate Minimum Wage Directive, Parliament insisted on an as strong as possible Article 9 on the linkage between collective bargaining and especially adequate minimum wages and public procurement as a leverage finally to respect these provisions, but also to create a fair and level playing field because if some respect minimum wages or collective bargaining and others not, this is also finally falsifying competition when we are talking about public procurement. As to your third question on joint and several liability in subcontracting chains, the public procurement directives are not the sole legal framework relevant to the issue of strengthening social rights, good working conditions and inclusive labour markets. The proposal for a directive on corporate sustainability, due diligence, on which co-legislators recently achieved a political agreement, is relevant here. It will set obligations for large companies to address the actual and potentially adverse impacts on human rights and the environment, also with respect to the operations of their subsidiaries and those carried out by their business partners. The directive will also lay down conditions for triggering on penalties and civil liability for infringing those obligations. With regard to your fourth question on funding, the Commission has taken steps to ensure that Union funding promotes socially responsible procurement procedures. The financial regulation provides for a number of measures that secure the promotion of socially responsible public procurement by EU institutions. On this basis, social aspects, for example, related to social and professional inclusion and equality and gender-related considerations are taken into account in procurement procedures. As far as question five is concerned, public authorities have several means to support the upskilling and reskilling of workers. They can ask in the clauses related to contract execution to require upskilling and reskilling of workers when it is related to the subject matter of the contract. They can also include upskilling and reskilling of workers as a key performance indicator as part of the award criteria. The bid of the economic operator offering higher upskilling or reskilling would get a higher score and better position to win the tender.  Finally, it is important to mention the ability of the Commission to monitor the procurement with social impact and to disseminate best practices to establish peer-to-peer learning. The Commission has launched important projects in this context. The new standard forms for uploading public procurement notices in the tender daily database will allow for better collection of procurement data on social procurement. With the public procurement data space, which will be operational this year, national governments will share information on procurement of lower value that are currently registered at a national level only. This will no doubt improve the quality of the data available. To conclude, public procurement in general is a powerful tool that can foster a more inclusive and equitable society and safeguard the rights of workers in public contracts. By using public procurement in a strategic way, public authorities can incentivise economic operators to adopt practices that preserve fundamental rights, enhance working conditions, promote upskilling, and foster inclusivity in the labour market. The European Commission has therefore supported and promoted this strategic approach to socially responsible public procurement through several initiatives that emphasise the integration of social considerations within public procurement practices across Member States.",-,2024-01-15,"19.

Dragoş Pîslaru,"Madam President, dear Commissioner Nicolas Schmit, the Public Procurement Directive has the potential to promote fair competition and inclusive labour markets, and it should do that. It could also be an essential instrument for increasing collective bargaining coverage in accordance with the Minimum Wage Directive. However, evidence shows that public authorities face legal challenges and uncertainty when trying to apply mandatory social award criteria and sustainable award criteria. The European Parliament Committee of Employment and Social Affairs has analysed rigorously this matter. In 2023, the Employment and Social Affairs Committee commissioned a study – DG IPOL has delivered the study – with the key findings of where we are. What is the status quo? On 25 October last year, we held a public hearing on the social impact of public procurement. Both activities pointed out the same issue: legal challenges and uncertainty. If we are to look at the dimension of public procurement in Europe, the source of wealth, the source that we can actually put together there for improving our markets is enormous – we are talking more than EUR 500 billion. Experts, representatives of local municipal authorities and of the social partners, stressed, in the hearing that we had, that the role of public procurement should be key in strengthening collective bargaining and social progress in the EU, and they pointed out the legal uncertainties of the current EU legislative framework on public procurement. Solutions that have been discussed in the Employment and Social Affairs Committee with our colleagues involved, first of all, revising the Public Procurement Directive so that there is an explicit push by public authorities to have no public contract without a collective agreement, clarifying that the promotion of collective bargaining with binding labour clauses does not violate EU law – and we had a big debate on that – revising the Public Procurement Directive to include mandatory social criteria, such as collective agreements, among others. It is therefore clear that the potential of socially responsible public procurement remains largely unexploited, and that the current voluntary approach is not sufficient, and that further work at EU level is necessary. Therefore, dear Commissioner Schmit, the questions to start this debate are the following. First of all, will the Commission consider revising the Directive to ensure legal certainty; in particular, to ensure that collective agreements and social criteria are not considered a discriminatory measure in public contracts? Second, will the Commission consider revising the Annex 10 of the Public Procurement Directive in order to update the ILO Conventions listed, especially with regard to ILO Convention 94? Furthermore, will the Commission take the necessary measure to ensure that the non-respect for fundamental ILO Conventions 98 and 87 become an exclusion criteria in the context of public procurement? The fourth question is: will the Commission promote joint and several liability in subcontracting chains? Fifth, will the Commission ensure social conditionalities in Union funding related to public procurement? This is very important. We should start negotiating the next multiannual financial framework soon, and we need to look at that. Six, will the Commission ensure that the public procurement plays a role in promoting upskilling and reskilling of workers, especially in the view of the new technologies arising from the green and digital transition? Seven, last but not least, will the Commission strengthen data collection on the volume and the value of socially responsible public procurement, as well as the exchange of knowledge and best practices in the EU? Together with my colleagues in the Employment and Social Affairs Committee, and based both on the research that we’ve done, and the hearing that we had with experts and representatives of local authorities and stakeholders, social partners, we believe that tapping on this important resource, on public procurement and providing social work criteria, is just the right step towards a social Europe, towards the model that we would like to build together. For that we need, again, the cooperation of all the institutions. The Parliament has initiated right now the process of this particular debate, and we are waiting and looking forward for how to push forward for this to happen.",Renew,2024-01-15,"19.

Mick Wallace,"Madam President, the persistence of complex labour market schemes involving undeclared work, abusive subcontracting, intermediaries and shell companies have had a severe impact on European workers, but none more so than on migrant workers. The European Labour Authority has done well so far to combat this through its cross-border actions, but it can do more if given the support of a stronger mandate. To do so, we need to extend the European Labour Authority’s scope to include the directives such as the Seasonal Workers Directive, Employers Sanctions Directive and the Anti-Trafficking Directive. We also need to see stronger cooperation between the European Labour Authority and its social partners, such as trade unions and workers organisations. A line of communication should be established where social partners can submit cases and request investigations, with a regularly updated timeline of progress. This is an opportunity to improve the enforcement of workers’ rights. (End of catch-the-eye procedure)",The Left,2024-01-15,18.

I mean, you only have to look at sectors of our economy, such as aviation, where we know that the trade unions continue to be absolutely frustrated with the total inaction of the European Commission, which is systematically refusing to assume its responsibility in this area and instead hiding behind national authorities denouncing complex labour market systems involving undeclared work, bogus self-employment, abuse of subcontracting letterbox companies and so on.

Maria Spyraki,"Mr President, honourable Commissioner, dear colleagues, the scientific evidence have already confirmed fluorinated gas and ozone-depleting substances which are used in everyday-life appliances, like refrigerators and air conditioners, are highly potent human-made greenhouse gases, with some of the worst global-warming potential, often several thousand times stronger than CO2. By strengthening rules to massively reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fluorinated gas and ozone-depleting substances by regulation, we prevent almost 500 million tonnes of further emissions by 2050, and it is much more than the equivalent emissions from the Netherlands. The regulations we conclude today will provide the European market and citizens incentives to use climate-friendly alternatives, and also contribute to further stimulation of the global market in order to accelerate this path of transition in third countries. It is also important to underline that the implementation of both pieces of this legislation has to facilitate customs and the surveillance authorities to control imports and exports, and to crack down on the illegal trade of gases and related equipment. There is a need for a comprehensive and efficient approach that will cover a broad range of substances and activities, and improve the procedure of reporting and verifying data. We have also to make climate-friendly technologies more widely available to accelerate the replacement of these substances with alternatives. We all know that this year hundreds of thousands of Europeans died prematurely, and many more suffer from heart and lung diseases or pollution-induced cancers. The longer we wait to reduce air and atmosphere pollution, the higher the cost to society. We need urgently to adopt more effective, efficient and immediately applicable measures to improve and protect the quality of our life and the environment.",PPE,2024-01-15,14.

President,"First of all, dear colleagues, it is with a deep sense of pride and honour that I inform you that on Saturday I was in Vilnius to receive on behalf of all MEPs and the European Parliament, the Freedom Prize from the Republic of Lithuania. It was a moving and emotional moment and I was glad to be there in your name to witness it. This prize is for all of you and your work in support of peace, democracy, human rights and freedom. It is in recognition of what our Parliament does. May it serve to continue to inspire our actions. (Applause) Dear colleagues, in the spirit of defending freedom, I need to refer again to what is happening in Belarus, still controlled by Europe’s last dictator. Activists, innocent people are still being detained arbitrarily. The number of political prisoners continues to grow. We cannot allow it to fall off the top of our agenda. That is why I have met with Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya last week and promised to do what we can to support political prisoners and urge their release. For that reason I have agreed to join their campaign and became a so-called ‘godparent’ of Palina Sharenda-Panasyuk, a mother, an activist, sentenced in 2021 and then in 2022 by Lukashenko’s regime to four years in prison on trumped‑up charges. Palina has been beaten, placed in a punishment cell, and refused medicines and access to her family or a lawyer. My appeal to all of you who have not yet done so is to join the campaign and consider adding your voice too. Dear colleagues, last year, you will recall, the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize to Jina Mahsa Amini and the Woman, Life, Freedom Movement. However, a few days before they were scheduled to receive their award, the Iranian regime placed Ms Mahsa Amini’s family under a travel ban – a stark example of the type of treatment that the people of Iran are faced with every day. On 12 December, this House welcomed Mr Saleh Nikbakht, the Amini family lawyer, to receive the Sakharov Prize on their behalf. Shortly after his return to Iran, Mr Saleh Nikbakht was arrested and the award was confiscated. According to our information, Mr Saleh Nikbakht has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment for allegedly engaging in ‘propaganda against the system’. It is a false charge. It is unacceptable. It is inexcusable, and this House condemns it. I want to recognise that bravery and commitment by Mr Saleh Nikbakht. He spoke eloquently and courageously. On behalf of the European Parliament, I call for the immediate and unconditional release of Mr Saleh Nikbakht. I will also take this opportunity to reiterate our unwavering support to Mahsa Amini’s family and the Woman, Life, Freedom Movement in their ceaseless fight for liberty, justice and human rights. You are not alone. Dear colleagues, on 21 December 2023 we witnessed a horrific – the worst – mass shooting in Czechia when a gunman in Prague shot dead 14 people at the Charles University and injured many more. It pains us to think of the many families that were forced to mourn their loved ones at a time of peace and togetherness.

Malik Azmani,"Madam President, dear colleagues, my political family was deeply touched by the death of Jacques Delors. On behalf of the Renew Europe Group, I send my condolences to his family. Jacques Delors was a great European and one of the most important founding fathers of today's European Union. Like President Macron said, he was l'architecte de l'Europe unie. Jacques Delors was a firm believer in a united Europe, in a Europe where our common future is key to the well-being of us all. He also advocated strongly for personal responsibility, a value close to the hearts of my Group. Europe is us. We need to continue Delors’ legacy. His vision ensured the free movement of people, goods and services within the European Union – a huge achievement. Building on his legacy means deepening the single market and completing it. The European Union has many successes, but the single market remains the biggest so far. Mr Delors also believed that Europe needed a soul and a human face. Today, people feel insecure and a loss of control. Europe must listen to their concerns and act upon it – on migration, on the economy. We honour its legacy by delivering solutions for European citizens. Jacques Delors said 'Europe is its people'. In this vital election year, may his truly European spirit guide us in the weeks and months to come. We thank you, Jack Delors.

Siegfried Mureşan,"Madam President, dear colleagues, today we are looking back at the life and legacy of Jacques Delors, an honorary citizen of Europe. Almost a century of life, a century in Europe, a century in which Europe has fundamentally changed – for the better, I say – and Jacques Delors had a big role to play in this. In the aftermath of the Second World War, Jacques Delors witnessed how the founding fathers of the European Union have given their hands and understood that hope over hate and fear, unity over division, and peace over war are the solutions for a better life in Europe. This is what Jacques Delors also believed in – witnessing himself the first steps of European integration. Staying on the shoulders of the founding fathers, he took Europe to the next stage of integration. We owe him the freedoms of movement, of people, of goods, of services and of capital in the European Union – what we call today the single market, the internal market. This was a flagship project of Commission President Jacques Delors, and it allows us all to live wherever we want in Europe, to work wherever we want in Europe, and it allows young people to study wherever they want in Europe. We owe to him the Erasmus programme. We also owe to him the organisation of the budget of the European Union in seven-year programmes, giving predictability and meaning to European policies. And he also created cohesion policy as we know it today. And we owe to him a lot of decisive steps towards the creation of the euro. All these make Europe more tangible. The legacy of Jacques Delors is bringing Europe closer to the individual, closer to the citizen. The legacy is making Europe relevant for each of us. A Europe that matters, that improves our lives; a Europe that is concrete; a Europe that we can witness and feel every day. It is a big legacy. For this, he was made an honorary citizen of Europe.

Ondřej Knotek,"Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, for ozone-depleting substances I think we have reached a very good deal. We will protect more the ozone layer, which is perfect, and I would like to thank the rapporteur, Jessica Polfjärd. On fluorinated gases, I would also like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Bas Eickhout. We are known from time to time to have different positions, but Bas has always remained constructive and from time to time even inclusively democratic. So, Bas, many thanks for it. But now, seriously, I was not happy, and I would even say I was a little shocked, when I saw the proposal from the European Commission, which was mainly driven by ideology and ambitions. In fact, it was imposing a risk on the availability of asthma medical inhalers, and the availability of heat pumps at a time of growing demand and a project called REPowerEU, and also some risk for the electricity grid. So it was not a good situation. I was even more shocked when some colleagues from the European Parliament wanted to go even further, just to be, let’s say, more ambitious than the European Commission, without seeing the full picture. But in the end, I must say that I’m happy with the final proposal, because I think we have succeeded, finally, to balance and to protect European citizens and businesses from, let’s say, unrealistic ambitions. And we strike a balance that’s very important between existing and emerging, more sustainable technologies. So it’s a good proposal in the end. We don’t impose a major risk on the energy and healthcare sectors within the EU, and I’m happy for this.",Renew,2024-01-15,14.

Stelios Kympouropoulos,"Mr President, dear colleagues, this is yet another historic moment for the EU. We are once again demonstrating the EU’s commitment to further reduce emissions into the atmosphere by completely phasing out HFCs by 2050. In that way, we are contributing to our efforts towards limiting the global temperature increase. For example, banning certain types of fluorinated gases in heat pumps as of 2032 alone will reduce the global temperature by 0.1°C. With this agreement, we are also putting into practice the REPowerEU goals for an energy-efficient and independent EU that leads the world in the clean energy transition. At the same time, we manage to do it in an innovation-friendly way by giving a clear direction to our industries. We reward innovation. We decarbonise, we don’t deindustrialise. We work with the budget, not against it, and we do it safely. And we also do it by making sure that we have enough trained and certified personnel who carry out activities involving fluorinated greenhouse gases. Thank you once again to the rapporteur, Bas Eickhout, and all the other shadows for the very positive outcome. And thank you to my colleague Jessica for the good work on the ozone-depleting substances file. And let us vote in favour of the agreement and make this legislation a reality.",PPE,2024-01-15,14.

Ivan Štefanec,"Mr President, dear colleagues, the deal reached on the new F-Gas Regulation sets us on the path towards the ambitious goal of reducing emissions by the equivalent of 40 million tonnes CO2 in the next six years, and achieving a full phase-out by 2050. Standing here on behalf of Sara Skyttedal, rapporteur for the ITRE opinion, I have to say that this path is not only ambitious, but also realistic. Thanks to the balanced phase-down in the first decade, in a way that will not jeopardise neither the repair of existing equipment nor the REPowerEU goals of a much-needed heat-pump deployment. The groups to the left in this House tend to view climate legislation in an astonishingly naive and short-sighted way, where the highest bidder has the most climate-friendly policy. I'm really happy that the new F-Gas Regulation instead follows the long-term balanced prescription of the centre-right: a climate policy that sets ambitious targets, but also delivers on them on account of securing the competitiveness of European industry. I'd like to thank Sara for her great work.",PPE,2024-01-15,14.

Nicolas Schmit,"Mr President, honourable Members, indeed today we discuss the compromises reached on two very important climate regulations, as it has just been eloquently pointed out. I thank the two rapporteurs for their work on making this agreement possible. It is an ambitious agreement that will decisively contribute to our climate objectives. On F-gases, the new rules before you today will strongly reduce F-gas emissions. This high ambition is great news in view of our climate targets for 2030 and reaching climate neutrality by 2050. In particular, the use of the most important group of F-gases, the HFCs, will be phased out by 2050, and we will strongly reduce other relevant F-gases such as SF6, the strongest known greenhouse gas. This will transform a number of sectors of our economy, including the air conditioning and heat pump sector, the electricity sector using electrical switchgear and the medical sector of asthma sprays, so that they are no longer depending on the highly-warming greenhouse gases. I perfectly join what has been said on how you can combine Europe's competitiveness, industrial competitiveness by improving our environmental approach and also by achieving our objectives. As Parliament demanded, the agreed review ensures that a number of sectors where alternatives are feasible will eventually completely avoid the use of substances that may produce PFAS in the medium term. This is the case of smaller heat pumps. Business as usual is no longer possible, and the European industry has an opportunity to become the first to supply these low-carbon and climate-neutral solutions globally. Already today, we are witnessing that the offer of fully climate-friendly heat pumps and switchgear on the EU market is increasing by the day, and many of these types of equipment are produced here in Europe, with a number of large new plants that have opened in recent months. Not least, this transition will bring significant financial benefits for citizens to with, for instance, more energy savings and less operation costs for many types of equipment, including heat pumps. Turning to the ozone-depleting substances regulation. Going ahead with the successful phase out of ozone-depleting substances is also essential for our climate agenda. Thanks to the Montreal Protocol, we can expect that the ozone hole will recover by approximately 2070 and prevent a major impact in global warming. Up to one degree of climate warming will be prevented by mid-century because of the global elimination of ozone-depleting substances. But these effects are ensured only if there is no backsliding. The EU must continue to lead by example and inspire others in the world to be ambitious. The EU will now be able to capture the large potential to save emissions from old insulation foams in houses for renovation or demolition, a measure that will certainly stimulate the recycling sector. But the compromise goes further, thanks to your efforts, in particular regarding the more hands-on approach to reduce feedstock use in chemical production, the main remaining use of ozone-depleting substances in the EU. In summary, on both files, the political agreement is excellent, representing a key step forward towards limiting global temperature increase and respecting the Paris Agreement. For this reason, I ask all distinguished Members here today to strongly endorse these compromises so that we can move on to implementation and make sure these emissions savings and other benefits can be achieved as quickly as possible.",-,2024-01-15,14.

Bas Eickhout,"Mr President, we are tomorrow going to vote on the revision of the F-Gas Regulation, which indeed I think is a very good example of a regulation that is improving our circumstances for our environment, but at the same time improving European competitiveness and European industry. First of all, I really would like to thank all the shadows for their negotiations and their support, and of course also the Council and the Commission for all their work in achieving this compromise. The F-Gas Regulation is existing, of course. The current one was already reducing our F-gas emissions and, just reminding, F-gases are very potent greenhouse gases. So, in the number of molecules we don't emit as much CO2, but some of those have an impact on the global warming potential, even up to 24 000. So that means one molecule has 24 000 times more of an impact on global warming than one molecule of CO2. So, this is the low-hanging fruit that we need to achieve. Already the existing regulation is reducing the use and the emissions of F-gases – and more or less two thirds of that is being reduced – with this regulation and achieving zero emissions by 2050, it means that all the F-gases will be out of our economy and will be replaced by natural alternatives, and that is a very clear prospect for all the investors from now on. If you are working on heat pumps and conditioning cooling systems, you know where to go to. You need to invest in the natural alternatives, and that is the very clear point to go to. This is also one of the first sectors that is then really achieving zero emissions that we have promised to achieve for the entire economy by 2050. In that sense, I think it's another good example of how this law can work. Of course, there were considerations and concerns about the heat pumps, which of course also demands a fast acceleration. I think, thanks to the negotiations with Council and my colleagues and the Commission, we have had a good compromise that is giving a clear signal also for the market, certainly for the heat pumps for consumers, but at the same time also making sure that this acceleration of expansion of heat pumps can be achieved. Also part of the concern was that if we are moving from F-gases with lower potential, we could be moving to chemicals that fall under the category of PFAs. I think that also gives you another very clear example, that  moving to the natural alternatives in some of these applications is very important. Maybe a very last point. This sector is having innovation mainly within Europe. If we are looking at the use of F-gases, it is mainly done by non-European industrial players. It's the European industrial players that are investing in the natural alternatives and are ahead of the game. So this regulation and this revision of the regulation is a support for European innovation, for achieving natural alternatives. And that not only makes this a very good environmental law, but it also makes it a very strong law for European competitiveness. I think that is a very important message to give, that environmental legislation can go hand in hand with good economic regulation. So with that, I would like to thank everyone, and I hope for a good approval tomorrow in the plenary. I'm looking forward to then the implementation by the Commission, to move as fast as possible to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, and in this sector to achieve zero emissions by 2050.",Greens/EFA,2024-01-15,14.
